Prostate cancer is a cancer which develops from cancerous cells in the prostate gland. It is the most common cancer in men in the UK with most cases developing in men over the age of 75. Symptoms include: poor stream, dribbling, and an urgency to urinate. The treatment of prostate cancer is complicated and varies between different cases.

What is prostate cancer?
Prostate cancer is a cancer which develops from cells in the prostate gland. It is the most common cancer in men in the UK. Each year, about 52,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the UK. It affects about 1 in 8 men in the UK at some point in their lives. Most cases develop in men over the age of 75 years.
Prostate cancer is often slow-growing, does not reduce life expectancy, and may not need treatment. In some cases it is more aggressive, spreads to other parts of the body and may benefit from treatment. In general, the more advanced the cancer (the more it has grown and spread), the less chance that treatment will be curative. However, treatment can often slow the progress of the cancer.
Prostate cancer is different to most other cancers because small areas of cancer within the prostate are actually very common, especially in older men. These may not grow or cause any problems for many years (if at all).
Prostate cancer explained
Prostate cancer causes
Although the exact cause is unclear, certain risk factors increase the chance that prostate cancer may develop. These include:
Ageing. Most cases occur in older men.
Ageing. Most cases occur in older men.
Family history and genetic factors. If your father or brother had prostate cancer at a relatively early age (before the age of 60 years) then you have an increased risk. Also, if the type of breast cancer which is linked to a faulty gene runs in your female relatives then you are at increased risk of prostate cancer. These factors point towards a faulty gene which may occur in some men.

Prostate cancer symptoms
Prostate cancer is often slow-growing. There may be no symptoms at first, even for years. As the tumour grows, it may press on and irritate the urethra, or cause a partial blockage to the flow of urine. Prostate cancer symptoms may then develop and can include one or more of the following:
Poor stream. The flow of urine is weaker, and it takes longer to empty your bladder.

Hesitancy. You may have to wait at the toilet for a while before urine starts to flow.

Poor emptying. You may have a feeling of not quite emptying your bladder.
Poor emptying. You may have a feeling of not quite emptying your bladder.
Note: all the above prostate cancer symptoms are common in older men. Most men who develop the above symptoms do not have prostate cancer but have a non-cancerous (benign) enlargement of the prostate. However, it is best to have any new symptoms checked out by a doctor.
Other symptoms such as pain at the base of the penis or passing blood occasionally occur. (These do not occur with benign prostate enlargement.)
If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, various other symptoms can develop. The most common site for the cancer to spread is to one or more bones, especially the pelvis, lower spine and hips. Affected bones can become painful and tender. Sometimes the first symptoms to develop are from secondary tumours in bones.
How is prostate cancer diagnosed?
Initial assessment
If a doctor suspects that you may have prostate cancer, he or she will usually:
Examine the prostate. They do this by inserting a gloved finger through the back passage (anus) into the rectum to feel the back of the prostate. An enlarged-feeling gland, particularly if it is not smooth to feel, may indicate prostate cancer. However, a normal-feeling prostate gland does not rule out prostate cancer.

An enlarged-feeling gland, particularly if it is not smooth to feel, may indicate prostate cancer. However, a normal-feeling prostate gland does not rule out prostate cancer.
Do a blood test to measure the level of prostate specific antigen (PSA). PSA is a chemical which is made by both normal and cancerous (malignant) prostate cells. Basically, the higher the level of PSA, the more likely that you have cancer of the prostate. However, a mild-to-moderately raised PSA can occur in conditions other than prostate cancer. (If you have confirmed prostate cancer, the PSA blood test is also used to monitor treatment. If treatment is working and cancer cells are killed then the level of PSA falls.)

Dr Krishna Vakharia, 16th October 2023
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended that a person should receive a diagnosis or ruling out of cancer within 28 days of being referred urgently by their GP for suspected cancer.
Multi-parametric MRI
Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) is a relatively new scanning technique that produces a detailed image of the prostate.
It has been approved by NICE, and could prevent unnecessary biopsies for those with low-risk cancer. It is hoped the system will make it easier to identify cancers earlier and reduce the need for further treatment.
It is recommended as a first-line investigation for people with suspected clinically localised prostate cancer. You can find out more in the 'Further Reading' section, below.
Biopsy
A biopsy is not always necessary to confirm a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Your doctor will be able to discuss the reasons for you to have a biopsy, if appropriate, with you in more detail.
A small biopsy of the prostate gland is taken by using a fine needle. This is usually done with the aid of a special ultrasound scanner. The probe of the scanner is about the size and shape of a finger. It is passed through the anus into the rectum to lie behind the prostate. This finds the exact position of the prostate. The doctor then pushes a fine needle into the back of the prostate from within the rectum to obtain the biopsy. Several samples are usually taken from different parts of the prostate.
Having a prostate biopsy can be uncomfortable. Therefore, local anaesthetic is used to reduce the pain as much as possible.
Sometimes prostate cancer is diagnosed from analysing the prostate tissue removed at the time of a prostatectomy operation, such as a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).
Grading and staging of prostate cancer
The severity of the disease is mainly based on three factors - the grade of the cancer cells, the stage of the cancer, and the blood PSA level.
Grade of the cancer
Samples of tissue (taken in the biopsy procedure) are looked at under the microscope to assess the cancer cells. By looking at certain features of the cells, the cancer can be graded. The common grading system used is called the Gleason Score.
A Gleason score of between 2 and 6 is a low-grade prostate cancer. It is likely to grow very slowly. A Gleason score of 7 is an intermediate grade that will grow at a moderate rate. A Gleason score of 8 to10 is a high-grade cancer that is likely to grow more quickly.
Staging
If you are confirmed to have prostate cancer, further tests may be advised to assess if it has spread. These tests are not advised in all cases. It depends on factors such as your age and the grade of the tumour cells. Tests which may be done include a bone scan, a computerised tomography (CT) scan, an MRI scan, a tummy (abdominal) ultrasound scan or other tests. This assessment is called staging of the cancer. The aim of staging is to find out:
How much the tumour has grown and whether it has grown through the wall of the prostate and into nearby structures such as the bladder wall.
How much the tumour has grown and whether it has grown through the wall of the prostate and into nearby structures such as the bladder wall.
Whether the cancer has spread to local lymph nodes.
Whether the cancer has spread to local lymph nodes.
Whether the cancer has spread to other areas of the body (metastasised).
Whether the cancer has spread to other areas of the body (metastasised).
See the separate leaflet called Stages of Cancer for more details.
Prostate cancer treatment
The treatment of prostate cancer is complicated. It varies tremendously between different cases. In addition, different men may choose to have different treatments compared to others with a similar type of prostate cancer.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend that everyone newly diagnosed with prostate cancer should be given a risk stratification. This means a measure of how high your risk is, which depends on several factors including how abnormal the prostate cancer cells are, how high your blood PSA level is and how far the cancer has spread.
The treatment options you will be offered will depend on these results and on what you and your doctor decide would be best for you.
Treatment options which may be considered include: surgery, radiotherapy, hormone treatment and, less commonly, chemotherapy. Often a combination of two or more of these treatments is used.
If a cancer is advanced then you may require treatments such as:
Nutritional supplements.

Painkillers.

Treatment aims
Treatment may aim to cure the cancer. In particular, the earlier the stage of the cancer, the better the chance of a cure. (Doctors tend to use the word remission rather than the word cured.
Remission means there is no evidence of cancer following treatment. If you are in remission, you may be cured. However, in some cases a cancer returns months or years later. This is why doctors are sometimes reluctant to use the word cured.)
Treatment may aim to control the cancer. If a cure is not realistic, with treatment it is often possible to limit the growth or spread of the cancer so that it progresses less rapidly. This may keep you free of symptoms for some time.
Treatment may aim to ease prostate cancer symptoms. Even if a cure is not possible, treatments may be used to reduce the size of a cancer, which may ease symptoms such as pain.
Treatment options for prostate cancer
Active surveillance: in some cases it may be best not to have any active treatment but to see how the cancer develops.

Hormone treatment: two groups of medicines are available:
Medicines which work on the pituitary gland - for example, goserelin, leuprorelin and triptorelin. (Your pituitary gland makes a hormone which circulates in the bloodstream to stimulate the testicles to make testosterone. These medicines stop your pituitary gland from making this stimulating hormone.) Goserelin is an implant that is injected under the skin. Leuprorelin and triptorelin are given by injection.
Medicines which block the action of testosterone (anti-androgen medicines) - for example, flutamide and cyproterone. These medicines are tablets.
NICE has recommended enzalutamide, along with hormone therapy, as an option to treat hormone-sensitive prostate cancer that has metastised. Enzalutamide blocks androgen receptors, meaning that it blocks the effect of the hormone testosterone on prostate cancer cells.

Dr Krishna Vakharia 26th May 2023
NICE have recommended the use of olaparib- a medication that stops cells becoming cancerous. It can only be used in those patients that have had genetic testing to know that their prostate cancer has BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and only if the cancer is metastatic (it has spread) and progressed after having newer hormonal treatments such as abiraterone or enzalutamide.
Evidence shows that people taking olaparib have more time before their cancer gets worse, and live longer overall.
Chemotherapy:
If your cancer has spread to other parts of your body (metastasised) and the cancer is hormone-sensitive, the current options are hormone treatment as above, with or without steroid treatment, or a type of chemotherapy called docetaxel with steroid treatment.

Apalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
NICE has recommended that an anti-androgen treatment called apalutamide can be offered in combination with anti-androgen medicines if:
You have hormone-sensitive prostate cancer that has metastasised and a form of chemotherapy called docetaxel isn't suitable; or
You have hormone-sensitive prostate cancer that has metastasised and a form of chemotherapy called docetaxel isn't suitable; or
You have hormone-sensitive prostate cancer which is at high risk of metastasising even though you are taking anti-androgen medicine.
You have hormone-sensitive prostate cancer which is at high risk of metastasising even though you are taking anti-androgen medicine.

Relugolix for treating hormone-sensitive prostate cancer

Hormone sensitive prostate cancer is usually treated with androgen deprivation therapy- these medications are usually gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) blockers (antagonists) that reduce the amount of testosterone produced by the body. Testosterone, a male hormone, can cause prostate cancers to grow, so by reducing these levels- the cancer can slow or stop the spread.

NICE has approved relugolix for treating:
- Advanced hormone sensitive prostate cancer
- High risk localised or locally advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer alongside radiotherapy
- High-risk localised or locally advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer as neoadjuvant treatment before radiotherapy.

Evidence suggests that it is better at reducing testosterone and reduces the risk of serious cardiovascular events, compared with leuprolide- the standard option. Indirect treatment comparisons, though uncertain, suggest that relugolix works as well as other androgen deprivation therapies.
Other treatments for prostate cancer
Cryotherapy (also known as cryosurgery) is an alternative treatment for men with early stage prostate cancer and recurrent prostate cancer. It is not yet available in all hospitals in the UK. It involves placing a number of metal probes through the skin and into the affected area of the prostate gland. The probes contain liquid nitrogen, which freezes and destroys the cancer cells.
High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment may be offered to some men, again with early prostate cancer. As this is still a relatively new procedure, it is not yet available in all hospitals in the UK. HIFU involves inserting a probe into the rectum. It is then pushed through the wall of the bowel into the prostate.
The probe produces a high-energy beam of ultrasound which then heats and destroys the cancer. The probe is surrounded by a cooling balloon to protect the normal prostate tissue from damage.
Dr Krishna Vakharia, 15th February 2024
For those adults who cannot have or do not want chemotherapy and who have untreated hormone-relapsed prostate cancer that has spread (metastatic), NICE has recommended the use of olaparib with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone (a form of steroid) as an option.
Initial evidence shows that people may live longer or have a longer time without their cancer getting worse with this combination.
If this is suitable for you- your specialist will discuss it with you.
Complications of prostate cancer
The possible complications of prostate cancer include:
Urinary obstruction, which may lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.

Outlook for prostate cancer
The outlook for prostate cancer is very variable. Some prostate cancers are slow-growing and do not affect life expectancy. On the other hand, some have already spread to other parts of the body when they are diagnosed. The response to treatment is also variable.
The treatment of cancer is a developing area of medicine. New treatments continue to be developed and the information on outlook above is very general. The specialist who knows your case can give more accurate information about your particular outlook and how well your type and stage of cancer are likely to respond to treatment.
Prostate cancer screening
Screening for prostate cancer is controversial. A routine blood test which shows a high PSA may indicate that you have prostate cancer. However, there are other causes of a high PSA. Also, many prostate cancers are slow-growing and do not cause problems, particularly in older men.
Some experts believe that if all men were screened then there may be many men found with a raised PSA level. Many men may then be investigated and treated unnecessarily with all the possible risks and side-effects of the investigations and treatment. Put simply, some people believe that screening for all men may do more harm than good.
Currently there is no national screening programme in the UK. However, you can decide for yourself if you would like a PSA test. It is best to discuss the pros and cons of the test with your GP. See the separate leaflet called Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Test for more information.

What is ovarian cancer?
Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that originates in the ovaries. These are the female reproductive organs responsible for producing eggs, and hormones such as oestrogen and progesterone.
The ovaries are walnut-sized organs located on either side of the womb (uterus). See the separate leaflet called Gynaecological cancer to learn more about where ovaries are and what they do.
Types of ovarian cancer
There are various types of ovarian cancer. They are classified by the type of cell from which the cancer originates:
Epithelial ovarian cancer
This is the most common type (about 9 in 10 cases). This type of cancer develops from one of the cells that surround the outside of each ovary. This outer layer of cells is called the germinal epithelium of the ovary.
Epithelial ovarian cancer mainly affects women who have had their menopause - usually women aged over 50 years. It is rare in younger women. There are various subtypes, depending on the exact look of the cells causing the cancer (which can be seen under the microscope).
Germ cell ovarian cancer
This type of ovarian cancer develops from germ cells (the cells that make the eggs). About 1 in 10 to 20 cases of ovarian cancer are germ cell cancers. They typically develop in younger women.
Again, there are various subtypes, depending on the exact look of the cells causing the cancer. Most cases of germ cell ovarian cancer are curable, even if diagnosed at a late stage, as it usually responds well to treatment.
Stromal ovarian cancer
This develops from connective tissue cells - the cells that fill the ovary and produce hormones. This type of cancer is rare.
The treatments and outlook (prognosis) are different for each type of ovarian cancer.
See the separate leaflet called Cancer for more general information about cancer.
The rest of this leaflet is only about epithelial ovarian cancer.
Stages of ovarian cancer
The stages of ovarian cancer are as follows:
Stage 1 - just involving the ovaries.
Stage 1 - just involving the ovaries.
Stage 2 - the cancer has spread outside the ovaries but not outside the pelvis.
Stage 2 - the cancer has spread outside the ovaries but not outside the pelvis.
Stage 3 - the cancer has spread outside the pelvis but not involved other areas of the body.
Stage 3 - the cancer has spread outside the pelvis but not involved other areas of the body.
Stage 4 - the cancer has spread to other parts of the body such as the liver and lungs.
Stage 4 - the cancer has spread to other parts of the body such as the liver and lungs.
Even with the above tests, the exact extent of spread (stage) may not be known until after an operation to treat the cancer.
How common is ovarian cancer?
About 7,500 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer every year in the UK. The majority of cases are in women aged over 50 years, although it can occur in younger women. About half of all cases occur in women aged 65 or more.
Symptoms of ovarian cancer
In many cases, no symptoms develop for quite some time after the cancer first develops. Symptoms may only be noticed when the cancerous (malignant) tumour has become quite large. As the tumour grows, the most common early symptoms include one or more of the following:
Constant pain or a feeling of pressure in the pelvic area (lower part of the tummy or abdomen).

Could it be something else?
All of the above symptoms can be caused by various other conditions. Also, when symptoms first start they are often vague for some time, such as mild discomfort in the lower abdomen. These symptoms may be thought to be due to other conditions.
The possibility of ovarian cancer may not be considered for some time until the symptoms become worse.
In particular, one condition that is often mistaken for ovarian cancer is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, it is uncommon for IBS to first develop in women over the age of 50 years.
(IBS typically first develops at a younger age - but may persist into later life.) So, if you have not had IBS-type symptoms in the past but then develop them aged over 50 years then ovarian cancer should be considered. It needs to be ruled out (usually by tests) before making a diagnosis of IBS.
If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, various other symptoms can develop.
What causes ovarian cancer?
A cancerous (malignant) tumour starts from one abnormal cell. The exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear. It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell. This makes the cell abnormal and causes it to multiply out of control. See the separate leaflet called Causes of cancer for more details.
Risk factors for ovarian cancer
In most cases, the reason why an ovarian cancer develops is not known. However, there are factors which are known to alter the risk of ovarian cancer developing. These include:
Age. Most cases occur in women over the age of 50 years.
Age. Most cases occur in women over the age of 50 years.
Producing an egg (ovulation). Factors that reduce the number of times a woman will ovulate slightly lower the risk. For example, taking the combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill, having children and breastfeeding. In contrast, not having children and having a late menopause slightly increase the risk.

Family history and genetic testing
Most cases of ovarian cancer are not due to genetic or hereditary factors. A few cases are due to faulty genes which increase the risk of cancer of the breast and ovary. Some women, trans men and non-binary people are referred for genetic testing if a faulty gene is suspected on the basis of a strong family history of certain cancers.
The most common genes are BRCA1 and BRCA2. For example, if you have two or more close relatives who have had ovarian or breast cancer at a young age (or certain other cancers), you may benefit from genetic testing. If this applies to you then it is advised that you see your GP to talk it through to establish if you should be referred for genetic testing.
In addition, if you are eligible for enhanced breast screening due to a family history of breast cancer, you should be aware of the early symptoms of ovarian cancer (see below). See a doctor promptly if you develop any of these symptoms.
How is ovarian cancer diagnosed?
If your doctor suspects you might have ovarian cancer they will refer you urgently to your local specialist - a gynaecologist. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended that a person should receive a diagnosis or ruling out of cancer within 28 days of being referred urgently by their GP for suspected cancer.
Initial tests
Initial tests to diagnose ovarian cancer may include:
An examination by a doctor. He or she may feel an enlarged ovary or another suspicious abnormality.
An examination by a doctor. He or she may feel an enlarged ovary or another suspicious abnormality.
An ultrasound scan. This is a painless test which uses sound waves to create images of structures inside your body. The probe of the scanner may be placed on your lower tummy (abdomen) to scan the ovaries. A small probe is also commonly placed inside the vagina to scan the ovaries from this angle in order to obtain more detailed pictures.

A blood test. A sample of blood can detect a protein called CA 125. The level of CA 125 is high in more than 8 in 10 women with advanced ovarian cancer and in about half of women with early ovarian cancer. Other non-cancerous (benign) conditions can also cause a high level. This means that this test does not conclusively diagnose or rule out ovarian cancer but it can be a helpful test. This test is also often used to monitor the effects of treatment for ovarian cancer.

Further tests
You may be advised to have further tests, depending on the symptoms that you have and the results of the initial tests. These tests can help to confirm the diagnosis and to stage the disease. The aim of staging is to find out:
How much the cancer has grown and whether it has grown into other nearby structures, such as the womb (uterus), bladder or back passage (rectum).

Removal (aspiration) of fluid. If your abdomen has swollen with fluid leading to a collection of fluid in the abdomen (ascites) then a sample can be taken. This is done by numbing a small area of skin on the abdomen, using local anaesthetic. A fine needle is then inserted through the abdominal wall and some fluid is drawn out. This fluid can then be looked at under the microscope to look for cancer cells.

Laparoscopy. This is a procedure to look inside your abdomen by using a laparoscope. A laparoscope is like a thin telescope with a light source. It is used to light up and magnify the structures inside the abdomen. A laparoscope is passed into the abdomen through a small cut (incision) in the skin. The ovaries and other internal organs can be seen. You would normally have a general anaesthetic for this. Also, small samples (biopsies) can be taken to be looked at under the microscope to detect and confirm cancer cells.

Ovarian cancer treatment
Treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy and occasionally radiotherapy. The treatment advised in each case depends on various factors such as the stage, type and subtype of the cancer and your general health.
A specialist will be able to give the pros and cons, likely success rate, possible side-effects and other details about the various possible treatment options for your type and stage of cancer.
You should also discuss with your specialist the aims of treatment. For example:
In some cases, treatment aims to cure the cancer. (Doctors tend to use the word remission rather than the word cured. Remission means there is no sign of cancer following treatment. If you are in remission, you may be cured. However, in some cases a cancer returns months or years later. This is why doctors are sometimes reluctant to use the word cured.)

Some treatments may be used to reduce the size of a cancer, which may ease symptoms such as pain.
Surgery
An operation is advised in most cases. If the cancer is at a very early stage (just confined to the ovary and not spread) then an operation to remove the affected ovary and associated Fallopian tube may be all the treatment required.
However, in many cases the cancer has grown into other nearby structures or has spread. Therefore, a more extensive operation is often needed. For example, the operation may involve removing the affected ovary, plus the womb (uterus), the other ovary and also other affected areas in the lower tummy (abdomen).
During the operation the surgeon may take small samples (biopsies) from structures in the abdomen and from structures lining the abdomen, such as the diaphragm or lymph glands (nodes).
The samples are looked at under the microscope to see if any cancer cells have spread to these structures. This helps to give an accurate staging and helps to decide on further treatment.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is a treatment of cancer by using anti-cancer drugs which kill cancer cells or stop them from multiplying.
In some cases, cells taken during surgery or at biopsy will be looked at under a microscope to check the risk of the cancer returning. If the risk is high, you will be offered chemotherapy. In other cases chemotherapy is given before surgery to make it more successful.
Newer treatment options for relapsed ovarian cancer
NICE has approved medicines called niraparib and olaparib for some women with ovarian cancer. These treatments are for women with ovarian, Fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer which is sensitive to platinum-based treatments but whose cancer has returned.
In these women, Niraparib and olaparib have been found to increase the time before the cancer progresses. They may also extend how long they live. If you have had at least two courses of platinum-based chemotherapy and your disease has come back, your doctor may recommend one of these treatments as an option.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy is a treatment that uses high-energy beams of radiation which are focused on cancerous (malignant) tissue. This kills cancer cells or stops cancer cells from multiplying.
Radiotherapy is not often used for ovarian cancer. It is sometimes used following surgery, to kill cancer cells which may have been left behind after the operation. Radiotherapy may also be used to shrink secondary tumours that have developed in other parts of the body and are causing pain or other symptoms.
Ovarian cancer prognosis
There is a good chance of a cure if ovarian cancer is diagnosed and treated when the disease is at an early stage (confined to the ovary and has not spread).
Unfortunately, most epithelial ovarian cancers are not diagnosed at an early stage. This is because symptoms often do not occur until after the cancer has grown quite large or has spread. In this situation, a cure is less likely but still possible.
In general, the later the stage and the higher the grade of the cancer, the poorer the outlook (prognosis). Even if a cure is not possible, treatment can often slow down the progression of the cancer.
Chemotherapy is very effective for cancer of the ovary and works well in most cases. However, the cancer can come back and does so in about three quarters of cases. Chemotherapy then does not work so well the second time. New treatments are being developed which show promise for treating cancer which comes back.
Overall at the current time, around 46 women in 100 diagnosed with ovarian cancer (of all types and stages) will be alive five years later. However, the outcome depends on the type of cancer and on the stage at which it is diagnosed.
The treatment of cancer is a developing area of medicine. New treatments continue to be developed and the information about outlook given above is very general. The specialist who knows your case can give more accurate information about your particular outlook and how well your cancer is likely to respond to treatment.
Is there a screening test for ovarian cancer?
Currently there is no ovarian cancer screening test that is offered to all susceptible people in the UK. Types of screening tests currently available are the CA 125 blood test and regular ultrasound scan of the ovary.
The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) was designed to look at the effect of screening - the pros and cons. The results were reported in 2023.
In this study 202,638 post-menopausal average risk women were included: 50,640 women were randomised to multimodal screening (blood tests and ultrasound), 50,639 had ultrasound based screening and 101,359 were in the control group.
Many ovarian cancers were detected in women with no symptoms at an early stage. Unfortunately, this did not always mean there was a lower risk of death. Additionally, many women who had an abnormal screening test had unnecessary surgery, as they were found not to have ovarian cancer.
Their conclusion was that screening using the CA125 blood test or ultrasound scan to test for ovarian cancer did not save lives. Additionally, it was associated with some harm. Therefore, an ovarian cancer screening programme for most women cannot be currently recommended.
Some people are currently offered screening if they have a strong family history of ovarian cancer. If you have two or more close relatives (sister, mother, aunt) who have had ovarian cancer or you have members in the family who have had breast cancer at a young age then you should talk with your doctor to see if you would benefit from screening.

Colon cancer and rectal cancer (also called colorectal cancer) are common in the UK. The colon and rectum are parts of your bowel. Most cases occur in people aged over 50. If bowel cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, there is a good chance of a cure.
In general, the more advanced the cancer (the more it has grown and spread), the less chance that treatment will be curative. However, treatment can often slow the progress of the cancer.

What is bowel cancer?
Bowel cancer is sometimes called colon or rectum cancer, colorectal cancer, or cancer of the large intestine. It is one of the most common cancers in the UK. (In contrast, cancer of the small intestine is rare.)
Bowel cancer can affect any part of the colon or rectum. However, it most commonly develops in the lower part of the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, or rectum.
Bowel cancer usually develops from a small fleshy growth (polyp) which has formed on the lining of the colon or rectum (see below). Sometimes bowel cancer begins from a cell within the lining of the colon or rectum which becomes cancerous.
Some rare types of cancer arise from various other cells in the wall of the colon or rectum. For example, carcinoid, lymphoma, and sarcomas. As the cancer cells multiply they form a tumour.
The tumour invades deeper into the wall of the colon or rectum. Some cells may break off into the lymph channels or bloodstream. The cancer may then spread (metastasise) to lymph nodes nearby or to other areas of the body - most commonly, the liver and lungs.
Polyps and bowel cancer
A bowel polyp (adenoma) is a small growth that sometimes forms on the inside lining of the colon or rectum. Most bowel polyps develop in older people. About 1 in 4 people over the age of 50 develop at least one bowel polyp. Polyps are non-cancerous (benign) and usually cause no problems.
However, sometimes a benign polyp can turn cancerous. If one does turn cancerous, the change usually takes place after a number of years. Most bowel cancers develop from a polyp that has been present for 5-15 years.
See the separate leaflet called Cancer for more general information about cancer.
Where are the colon and rectum?
The colon and rectum are parts of the bowel or gut (gastrointestinal tract). The gut starts at the mouth and ends at the anus. When we eat or drink, the food and liquid travel down the gullet (oesophagus) into the stomach. The stomach churns up the food and then passes it into the small intestine.
Diagram naming the parts of the gut
Large bowel - cancer
The small bowel (small intestine) is several metres long and is where food is digested and absorbed. Undigested food, water and waste products are then passed into the large bowel (large intestine). The main part of the large intestine is called the colon, which is about 150 cm long.
This is split into four sections: the ascending, transverse, descending and sigmoid colon. Some water and salts are absorbed into the body from the colon. The last part of the colon is called the rectum, which is about 15 cm long. The rectum stores stools (faeces) before they are passed out from the anus.
Cancer
There are around 44,100 new bowel cancer cases in the UK every year, that's around 120 people every day. Bowel cancer is the 4th most common cancer in the UK, accounting for 11% of all new cancer cases according to Cancer Research UK. However, whilst the overall rates of bowel cancer are falling, the number of under 50s who have the condition is increasing. No matter your age, there are many things you can do to help reduce your chance of getting bowel cancer. Here, gastroenterologist and colon cancer specialist Dr Monique van Leerdam shares her advice.

What causes bowel cancer?
The exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear. It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell. This makes the cell abnormal and multiply out of control.
See the separate leaflet called Causes of Cancer for more details.
Risk factors
Although bowel cancer can develop for no apparent reason, there are certain risk factors which increase the chance that bowel cancer will develop. Risk factors include:
Ageing: bowel cancer is more common in older people. Eight out of ten people who are diagnosed with bowel cancer are older than 60 years.

Bowel cancer symptoms
When a bowel cancer first develops and is small it usually causes no symptoms. As it grows, the symptoms and signs of bowel cancer that develop can vary, depending on the site of the tumour.
The most common bowel cancer symptoms to first develop are:
Bleeding from the tumour. You may see blood mixed up with your stools (faeces). Sometimes the blood can make the faeces turn a very dark colour. The bleeding is not usually severe and in many cases it is not noticed, as it is just a small trickle which is mixed with the faeces. However, small amounts of bleeding that occur regularly can lead to anaemia which can make you tired and pale.

If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, various other symptoms can develop. The symptoms depend on where it has spread to.
All the above symptoms can be due to other conditions, so tests are needed to confirm bowel cancer.
Contact a doctor if you have any of the symptoms mentioned, or if you're worried you might have bowel cancer.
How is bowel cancer diagnosed?
Initial assessment
If a doctor suspects that you may have bowel cancer, he or she will examine you. The examination will usually include a rectal examination. The doctor inserts a gloved finger through your anus into your rectum to feel if there is a tumour in the lower part of the rectum. However, often the examination is normal, especially if the cancer is in its early stages. Your doctor may also arrange blood tests and a faecal (poo) test called a FIT test.
FIT testing looks for tiny amounts of blood in the poo. It's useful even if you have visible blood in poo (try to take the sample from an area without visible blood). A negative FIT test makes bowel cancer unlikely; a positive FIT test can be caused by many things other than bowel cancer, but usually means that your doctor will refer you to a specialist urgently for further tests.
Dr Krishna Vakharia, 16th October 2023
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended that a person should receive a diagnosis or ruling out of cancer within 28 days of being referred urgently by their GP for suspected cancer.
One or more of the following tests may be arranged:
Colonoscopy
A colonoscopy is a test in which a long, thin, flexible telescope (a colonoscope) is passed through your anus into your rectum and colon. This enables the whole of your colon and rectum to be looked at in detail.
Flexible sigmoidoscopy
This is similar to colonoscopy. The difference is that a shorter telescope is used which is inserted only into the rectum and sigmoid colon.
CT colonography
This test uses X-rays to build up a series of images of your colon and rectum. A computer then organises these to create a detailed picture that may show polyps or anything else unusual on the surface of your colon or rectum. This is good for people who are unable to have a colonoscopy, or don't want to have one. However, if anything is seen on the CT scan, it's likely that a colonoscopy will be offered as the next step anyway.
See the separate leaflets called Colonoscopy, Sigmoidoscopy, and CT Colonography.
Biopsy - to confirm the diagnosis
A biopsy entails a small sample of tissue being removed from a part of the body. The sample is then examined under the microscope to look for abnormal cells. If you have a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, the doctor or nurse can take a biopsy of any abnormal tissue. This is done by passing a thin grabbing instrument down a side channel of the colonoscope or sigmoidoscope. It can take up to two weeks for the result of a biopsy.
Assessing the extent and spread of bowel cancer
If you are confirmed to have bowel cancer, further tests may be done to assess if it has spread. For example, a computerised tomography (CT) scan, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, or an ultrasound scan. This assessment is called staging of the cancer. The aim of staging is to find out:
How much the tumour in the colon or rectum has grown, and whether it has grown partially or fully through the wall of the colon or rectum.
How much the tumour in the colon or rectum has grown, and whether it has grown partially or fully through the wall of the colon or rectum.
Whether the cancer has spread to local lymph nodes.
Whether the cancer has spread to local lymph nodes.
Whether the cancer has spread to other areas of the body (metastasised).
Whether the cancer has spread to other areas of the body (metastasised).
By finding out the stage of the cancer, it helps doctors to advise on the best treatment options. It also gives a reasonable indication of outlook (prognosis). For bowel cancer, it may not be possible to give an accurate staging until after an operation to remove the tumour. The tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) classification system is being increasingly used to stage bowel cancer. See the separate leaflet called Stages of Cancer for details.

The treatment advised for each case depends on various factors such as the stage of the cancer (how large the cancer is and whether it has spread), and your general health.
You should have a full discussion with a specialist who knows your case. They will be able to give the pros and cons, likely success rate, possible side-effects and other details about the various possible treatment options for your type of cancer.
You should also discuss with your specialist the aims of treatment. For example:
Curing the cancer
Some bowel cancers can be cured, particularly if they are treated in the early stages of the disease. (Doctors tend to use the word remission rather than the word cured. Remission means there is no evidence of cancer following treatment. If you are in remission, you may be cured. However, in some cases a cancer returns months or years later. This is why some doctors are reluctant to use the word cured.)
Controlling the cancer
If a cure is not realistic, with treatment it is often possible to limit the growth or spread of the cancer so that it progresses less rapidly. This may keep you free of symptoms for some time.
Easing symptoms
If a cure is not possible, treatments may be used to reduce the size of a cancer, which may ease symptoms such as pain. If a cancer is advanced then you may require treatments such as nutritional supplements, painkillers or other techniques to help keep you free of pain and any other symptoms.
Surgery
It is often possible to remove the primary tumour surgically. Removing the tumour may be curative if the cancer is in an early stage. The common operation is to cut through the colon or rectum above and below the tumour. The affected section is then removed and, if possible, the two cut ends are sewn together.
Sometimes a temporary colostomy is done to allow the joined ends to heal without stools (faeces) passing through. The colostomy is often reversed in a second operation a few months later when the joined ends of the colon or rectum are well healed.
Sometimes a temporary colostomy is done to allow the joined ends to heal without stools (faeces) passing through. The colostomy is often reversed in a second operation a few months later when the joined ends of the colon or rectum are well healed.
If the tumour is low down in the rectum, then the rectum and anus need to be removed. You would then need a permanent colostomy.
If the tumour is low down in the rectum, then the rectum and anus need to be removed. You would then need a permanent colostomy.
A colostomy procedure entails an opening (hole) being made through the wall of the tummy (abdomen). A section of colon is then cut and the edges are attached to the opening in the abdominal wall. This is called a stoma and it allows faeces to pass out from the colon into a disposable bag which is stuck over the stoma.
Even if the cancer is advanced and a cure is not possible, surgery may still have a place to ease symptoms. For example, a stent can be inserted to ease a blocked colon.
A stent is a thin metal tube which is placed through a narrowed or blocked section of colon. It can then be opened wide and remains in the colon to prevent a further blockage.
Chemotherapy
One or other of these treatments may be advised depending on the site and stage of the cancer. Chemotherapy is a treatment of cancer by using anti-cancer medicines which kill cancer cells or stop them from multiplying.
Chemotherapy is increasingly being used for people with bowel cancer. Chemotherapy is used:
Sometimes, before surgery, to shrink the tumour and reduce the chances of the cancer coming back (neoadjuvant chemotherapy).

Targeted treatment and immunotherapy
Targeted treatments and immunotherapy are newer medications. Targeted treatments are designed to affect cancer cells selectively. Immunotherapy uses your immune system to kill cancer cells.
Targeted treatments and immunotherapy are used to treat advanced (metastatic) bowel cancer.
Many of the targeted treatments and immunotherapies are only suitable if the cancer has certain genetic changes. These are tested for in the original biopsy sample of the cancer.
Radiotherapy
This is a treatment which uses high-energy beams of radiation which are focused on cancerous tissue. This kills cancer cells, or stops cancer cells from multiplying. It is most commonly used for bowel cancer when the tumour is in the rectum. See the separate leaflet called Radiotherapy for details.
Radiotherapy can be used:

What is the outlook?
There has been a substantial improvement in bowel cancer outlook (prognosis) over the past decade. Without bowel cancer treatment, a cancerous tumour in the bowel is likely to become larger and spread to other parts of the body.
However, in many cases it grows slowly and may remain confined to the lining of the colon or rectum for some months before growing through the wall of the colon or rectum, or spreading. You have a good chance of a cure if you are diagnosed and treated when the cancer is in this early stage.
Doctors and researchers often use a statistic called '5-year survival' to estimate prognosis in cancer. This looks at large groups of people and describes how many of them will still be alive at five years after diagnosis. This gives an idea of the prognosis for a group of people, but can't tell exactly what will happen to an individual.
In England and Wales, between 2013 and 2017, the 5-year survival rates for bowel cancer, according to Cancer Research UK, were:
For stage 1 bowel cancer (cancer that has only grown into the inner part of the bowel wall), about 90 out of every 100 people are alive five years after diagnosis.
For stage 1 bowel cancer (cancer that has only grown into the inner part of the bowel wall), about 90 out of every 100 people are alive five years after diagnosis.
For stage 2 bowel cancer (cancer that has grown into the inner and outer part of the bowel wall), over 80 out of every 100 people are alive five years after diagnosis.
For stage 2 bowel cancer (cancer that has grown into the inner and outer part of the bowel wall), over 80 out of every 100 people are alive five years after diagnosis.

The treatment of cancer is a developing area of medicine. New treatments continue to be developed and the information on outlook above is very general. Your specialist can give more accurate information about your particular outlook, and how well your type of cancer and stage of cancer are likely to respond to treatment.
Screening for bowel cancer
A screening test aims to detect a disease before it has caused symptoms and when treatment is likely to be curative.
A simple screening test for bowel cancer, which tests for traces of blood in the stools (faeces), has been introduced in the UK. This bowel cancer screening test is offered to all people of certain older ages. In addition, some younger people may be offered screening if they have a higher-than-average risk of developing bowel cancer. There is a separate leaflet called Bowel Cancer Screening that gives details of the screening programme.

Leukaemia is a cancer of blood-forming cells. There are different types of leukaemia. If you develop leukaemia it is important to know what type it is. This is because the outlook (prognosis) and treatments vary for the different types.

What is leukaemia?
Leukaemia is a cancer of cells in the bone marrow (the cells which develop into white blood cells).
Cancer is a disease of the cells in the body. There are many types of cancer which arise from different types of cell. What all cancers have in common is that the cancer cells are abnormal and do not respond to normal control mechanisms. Large numbers of cancer cells build up because they multiply 'out of control', or because they live much longer than normal cells, or both.
With leukaemia, the cancerous cells in the bone marrow spill out into the bloodstream. There are several types of leukaemia. Most types arise from cells which normally develop into white blood cells. (The word leukaemia comes from a Greek word which means 'white blood'.)
If you develop leukaemia it is important to know exactly what type it is. This is because the outlook (prognosis) and treatments vary for the different types. Before discussing the different types of leukaemia it may help to know some basics about normal blood cells and how they are made.
The main types of leukaemia
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).
Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML).
Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML).
There are various 'subtypes' of each of these. In addition there are some other rare types of leukaemia. The word:
'Acute' means the disease develops and progresses quite quickly.
'Acute' means the disease develops and progresses quite quickly.
'Chronic' means persistent or ongoing. When talking about leukaemia, the word chronic also means that the disease develops and progresses slowly (even without treatment).
'Chronic' means persistent or ongoing. When talking about leukaemia, the word chronic also means that the disease develops and progresses slowly (even without treatment).
'Lymphoblastic' and 'lymphocytic' mean that an abnormal cancerous cell is a cell that originated from a lymphoid stem cell.

'Myeloid' means that an abnormal cancerous cell is a cell that originated from a myeloid stem cell.
'Myeloid' means that an abnormal cancerous cell is a cell that originated from a myeloid stem cell.
What causes leukaemia?
A leukaemia is thought to start first from one abnormal cell. What seems to happen is that certain vital genes which control how cells divide, multiply and die, are damaged or altered. This makes the cell abnormal. If the abnormal cell survives it may multiply 'out of control' or survive a long time, and develop into a leukaemia.
In most cases of leukaemia, the reason why a cell becomes abnormal is not known. There are certain 'risk factors' which increase the chance that certain leukaemias will develop, but these only account for a small number of cases.
Risk factors for some types of leukaemia
Radiation exposure is known to be a risk factor. For example, previous radiotherapy for another condition. Additionally many of the survivors of the atom bomb used in World War II developed leukaemia due to the fall-out of radiation.

Leukaemia symptoms
As large numbers of abnormal blood cells are made, much of the bone marrow fills with these abnormal cells. Because of this it is difficult for normal cells in the bone marrow to survive and make enough normal mature blood cells. Also, the abnormal cells spill out into the bloodstream. Therefore, the main problems which can develop include:
Anaemia
This occurs as the number of red blood cells in the bloodstream goes down. This can cause tiredness, breathlessness and other symptoms. You may also look pale.
Blood clotting problems
This is due to low levels of platelets in the bloodstream. This can cause easy bruising, bleeding from the gums and other bleeding-related problems.
Serious infections
The abnormal white blood cells do not protect against infection. Also, there is a reduced number of normal white blood cells which usually combat infection. Therefore, serious infections are more likely to develop. Depending on the type and site of infection which develops, the symptoms can vary greatly.
How long do leukaemia symptoms take to develop?
The time taken to develop these symptoms after the disease starts varies. Typically, it is within weeks for ALL or AML. It may take months or years for symptoms to develop with CLL or CML, as these leukaemias progress slowly.
The abnormal cells may also build up in lymph glands and in the spleen. You may therefore develop swollen glands in various parts of the body, and develop an enlarged spleen.
Other symptoms which may develop include pain in the bones or joints (mainly with ALL), persistent raised temperature (fever), and weight loss.
How is leukaemia diagnosed and assessed?
A blood test
A blood test can often suggest the diagnosis of leukaemia, as abnormal cells are often detected in the blood test. Further tests are usually done to confirm the diagnosis.
A bone marrow sample
For this test, a small amount of bone marrow is removed by inserting a needle into the pelvic bone (or sometimes the breastbone (sternum)). Local anaesthetic is used to numb the area. A small sample of bone may also be taken. The samples are put under the microscope to look for abnormal cells and are also tested in other ways. This can confirm the diagnosis. (See the separate leaflet called Bone Marrow Biopsy and Aspiration for more detail.) A bone marrow test may not be needed to confirm the diagnosis of CLL.
Cell and chromosome analysis
Detailed tests are often done on abnormal cells obtained from the bone marrow sample or blood test. These find out the exact type or subtype of the cell that is abnormal.
Lumbar puncture
This test collects a small amount of fluid from around the spinal cord - cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is done by inserting a needle between the bones (vertebrae) in the lower (lumbar) region of the back. (See the separate leaflet called Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap) for more detail.) By examining the fluid for leukaemia cells, it helps to find out if the leukaemia has spread to the brain and spinal cord. This is mainly done when assessing ALL and sometimes AML.
Various other tests
A chest X-ray, blood tests and other tests are usually done to assess your general well-being.
Leukaemia treatment
The treatment advised depends on the exact type of leukaemia and on the stage it is at. For example, ALL is usually treated as soon as possible with intensive chemotherapy. On the other hand, people in the early stages of CLL may not need any treatment. This is because CLL often progresses very slowly and may not need treatment for several years.

What is the outlook for leukaemia?
The outlook (prognosis) varies for each of the different leukaemias. However, the overall outlook may be better than many people imagine. For example, the outlook for ALL has greatly improved over the period of 20 years or so. Most children with ALL can now be cured.
Also, the chronic leukaemias (CLL and CML) often progress slowly - often over several years. Even in those cases which are not cured, treatment with chemotherapy and other treatments can often prolong survival for quite some time.
Some chemotherapy medicines can affect fertility in both men and women. Sometimes this is temporary and sometimes it is permanent. There is also a very small risk that some medicines used to treat leukaemia may cause another form of cancer much later in your life.
The treatment of cancer and leukaemia is a developing area of medicine. New treatments continue to be developed and the information on outlook above is very general. There are some newer medicines that have been introduced in the last few years that show promise to improve the outlook. The specialist who knows your case can give more accurate information about the treatment and outlook for your particular situation.
