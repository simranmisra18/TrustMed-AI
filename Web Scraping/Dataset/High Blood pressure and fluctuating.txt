hello, your age, weight and general fitness level will have an impact on any advice someone can give, also your diet and if you smoke, drink coffee, alcohol.
A doctor should advise you on any medicines you may need but will also look at these other things that will affect your blood pressure.
without knowing all of it it is hard to advise you as to what may help
