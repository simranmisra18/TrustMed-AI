Hello.
A week ago today I was diagnosed with afib (after a gruelling 15 hours at hospital) I was just sent home with blood thinners and beta-blockers and awaiting a call for a cardioversion. I feel like nobody went through what this actually means and talked about the illness with me yet.
For me being 36 years old I know this is young to have afib and all I can think of is how will this impact my everyday life and can I still do all the things I like to do? The main one will I die young?
I am a naturally anxious person so I’m constantly checking my heart rhythm and when it gets to the late 40s I panic I’m also worried to be alone and I think I’m uneducated with it all at the moment as it’s still so new to me.
Does anyone have any advice?

i got afib aged 35 - rule 1 - dont panic, just breathe, your not going to drop dead. Its shit but let the health professionals do there job - you’ll come out the other end and thats when you need to do your job. That is looking after your mental health - eat right, cut right down on alcohol and caffine, get plenty of sleep. The number 1 advice id give you is when you get the all clear start exercising - it will be the last thing you want to do but start slowly and build it up - do anything but do it often - walk run swim - just doing it reinforces the thoughts in your mind that you are ok - if you can walk 5k then why do you need to worry about your heart ? Your job is to not let this effect your mental health - read a book called Dare by barry mcdonagh, its the best book ive read about dealing with anxiety
