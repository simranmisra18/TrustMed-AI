Erectile dysfunction (ED) means that you cannot get and/or maintain an erection. In some cases the penis becomes partly erect but not hard enough to have sex properly. In other cases, there is no swelling or fullness of the penis at all. Both can have a significant effect on your sex life. Erectile dysfunction is sometimes called impotence.
ED is usually treatable, most commonly by a tablet taken before sex. You may also receive lifestyle advice and treatments to minimise your risk of heart disease.

Some of the different causes of erectile dysfunction (see below) can also cause other symptoms.
How do erections happen?
It's useful to understand how erections happen normally, as this helps to explain why the different causes of erectile dysfunction cause problems.
An erection is when the penis becomes enlarged and firm, to allow for sexual penetration or masturbation.
Erections usually happen because someone is sexually aroused, although not always - they can also occur for no obvious reason, especially in boys going through puberty. It's also normal to wake up with an erection ('morning wood') even if not feeling aroused.
Usually, though, getting an erection requires being sexually aroused. Sexual arousal is very complicated, and everyone gets aroused by different things. Feeling anxious, tired, preoccupied, or otherwise not turned-on can stop this happening. Sexual arousal can also be affected by psychological and mental health issues, such as depression.
When sexually aroused, the brain sends messages down through the spinal cord, and through nerves in the pelvis, to the penis. These messages cause changes in the blood vessels of the penis. Arteries supplying the penis dilate (get wider), allowing more blood flow into the penis. Muscles in the penis and pelvis squeeze the veins which drain blood from the penis, reducing the blood flow out of the penis. This causes blood to build up inside the tissues of the penis, increasing the pressure inside the penis, and making the penis firm and erect.
So, problems with the nerve supply to the penis, and problems with blood flow to the penis, can also cause erectile dysfunction.
What causes erectile dysfunction?
It's normal to have difficulty getting or keeping an erection from time-to-time. This can be due to:
Being tired.

Being distracted.

Using other recreational drugs, such as MDMA (ecstasy).
Once those triggers have disappeared, it should be possible to get an erection again as normal.
It's also normal to be unable to get an erection or have an orgasm for a short time after ejaculating. This is known as the 'refractory period' and usually lasts minutes to hours, although can sometimes last for days in some people.
However, some men have long-standing, or recurring ED problems, and this can cause them lots of distress.
Causes of erectile dysfunction can be divided into 'physical' and 'psychological' problems. Sometimes, there may be more than one cause, and it's possible to have both physical and psychological issues affecting erections at the same time.
What is the main cause of erectile dysfunction?
This differs depending on age. In men over the age of 40, physical problems causing reduced blood flow to the penis are the most common cause of erectile dysfunction. In younger men, psychological problems are more common.
Physical causes of erectile dysfunction
About 8 in 10 cases of erectile dysfunction are due to a physical cause. These include:
Reduced blood flow to the penis, due to narrowing of blood vessels (atherosclerosis).
This is the most common cause of erectile dysfunction. Narrowing of the arteries can be caused by:
Smoking.
High blood pressure.
Having high cholesterol.
Diabetes.
Getting older.

Venous leak (meaning that blood leaves the penis too quickly, causing loss of an erection).
Reduced blood flow to the penis is, by far, the most common cause of erectile dysfunction in men over the age of 40. Like in other parts of the body, the arteries which take blood to the penis can become narrowed. The blood flow may then not be enough to cause an erection.
If blood vessel narrowing (atherosclerosis) is causing erectile dysfunction, you are more likely to develop narrowing of other blood vessels - such as the blood vessels supplying the heart. So, it's a good idea to speak to a doctor to find out what you can do to keep your heart healthy, such as stopping smoking, managing diabetes (if you have it), and making sure your blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control.
In most cases of ED due to physical causes (apart from injury or after surgery), the erectile dysfunction tends to develop slowly. So, you may have intermittent or partial ED for a while, which may gradually become worse. You are likely still to have a normal sex drive (libido) unless the cause is due to a hormonal problem.
Physical causes of erectile dysfunction usually cause erectile problems that are present all of the time, meaning that it's difficult to get an erection when masturbating or at any other times, such as first thing in the morning.
For more information on how alcohol and drug abuse can cause ED, see the leaflets on Alcoholism and problem drinking and Drug dependence treatment.
Psychological causes of erectile dysfunction
Erectile dysfunction can also be caused by psychological issues. These can be specific psychological issues around sex and intimacy, or a part of a wider mental health problem, such as depression.
Potential psychological causes include:
Stress - for example, due to a difficult work or home situation.

There might be a link between erectile dysfunction and heavy or problematic use of pornography. Some studies have found that erectile dysfunction is more common in men who have symptoms of pornography addiction. Some people use the term 'porn-induced erectile dysfunction' to describe this. This link is controversial, though, and there is not much research yet in this area; other people dispute the connection. For example, it's not clear if excessive porn use causes erectile dysfunction, or if there are other explanations, such as the excessive porn use being caused by other things, like depression or relationship problems, which are also causing erectile dysfunction.
Usually - although not always - the erectile dysfunction develops quite suddenly if it is a symptom of a mental health problem. The erectile dysfunction may resolve when your mental state improves - for example, if your anxiety or depression eases.
However, some people become even more anxious or depressed when they develop erectile dysfunction, which creates a vicious cycle of worsening anxiety and persisting erectile dysfunction. This is typically the case with performance anxiety as well.
A psychological cause of erectile dysfunction is more likely if you are able to get an erection at some times, but not at others: for example, if you still get morning erections, and can get an erection when masturbating, but can't get an erection for sex.
Sexual health
You can now buy erectile dysfunction (ED) medication over the counter at pharmacies. However, some men would be better off seeing their GP first as dosage and treatment options may need adjusting, and persistent ED can be an early warning sign of cardiovascular disease and other health conditions.

Sexual health
Urethritis means inflammation of the urethra (the tube inside your penis which carries urine out of your bladder). Urethritis is usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) but not always. It can occur within a stable relationship.
by Dr Toni Hazell, MRCGP
How common is erectile dysfunction?
ED is more common as you get older. About 50% of men between the ages of 40 and 70 have erectile dysfunction and about 70% of men aged 70 and above have erectile dysfunction. However, because many men don't seek medical help for ED, it is impossible to know exactly how common it is.
In recent years, erectile dysfunction seems to be becoming more common amongst younger men. We don't know why this is the case. It might be that younger men are becoming more likely to come forward to seek help, rather than suffering in silence. Other possible explanations include mental health problems becoming more common, and internet pornography becoming much more available, possibly leading to problematic porn use.
How is erectile dysfunction diagnosed?
Your GP will discuss the problem with you, go over any medication you may be taking, and may do a physical examination. This can help to work out the cause of the erectile dysfunction.
Tests aren't always needed, but may be recommended to look for other causes of erectile dysfunction, and associated problems. These depend on the situation, but might include some or all of the following:
A blood test to check the level of cholesterol and other fats (lipids).

There are some more specialised tests, such as scans to measure blood flow in the penis, which may be recommended by hospital specialists in a few situations - but these are rarely needed.
Measuring the severity of erectile dysfunction
The severity of erectile dysfunction is measured on the basis of several factors:
How you rate your confidence that you can get and keep an erection.

How often your erections are hard enough for you to penetrate your partner following sexual stimulation.

The Sexual History Inventory for Men questionnaire (SHIM) questionnaire (see 'Further Reading' below) uses these questions to give an idea of whether your erectile dysfunction would be classed as mild, mild-moderate, moderate or severe.
Erectile dysfunction treatment
There are lots of treatments for erectile dysfunction, and they are often very helpful. The following gives a brief summary of the options:
Treating an underlying cause
For example, treating depression or anxiety, changing medication, or treating certain hormonal conditions may cure the associated erectile dysfunction.
Lifestyle and other advice
Lifestyle changes may help, such as:
Losing weight if you are overweight.

Stopping smoking.
Stopping smoking.
Taking regular exercise.

Reducing or stopping drug use.

Keeping alcohol drinking to within recommended limits.
Keeping alcohol drinking to within recommended limits.
Erectile dysfunction is often a sign that you are at higher risk of developing heart disease or other cardiovascular diseases. It's therefore especially important to think about whether you can make any other lifestyle changes to keep your heart healthy.
Also, your doctor may prescribe a statin medicine to lower your blood cholesterol level if your risk of developing cardiovascular disease is high.
They may also suggest blood pressure-lowering medication, if you have high blood pressure (hypertension).
In some people, problematic porn use - such as porn addiction - might be linked to erectile dysfunction (although this is disputed). This might be the case if you use porn very regularly, and are only able to get an erection when viewing porn, but not when having sex with a partner. If you think this might apply to you, it may be helpful to take a break from viewing porn for a few weeks and see if this helps. If porn use is causing problems in your life, and you are finding it difficult to control, consider seeking therapy or counselling.
Counselling
Sometimes couple counselling, or sex therapy is useful. These are most useful if mental health (psychological) problems are the cause of, or the result of, erectile dysfunction.
Psychosexual therapy, or sex therapy, can also be useful for treating emotional and psychological issues that are linked to erectile dysfunction.
Tablets for erectile dysfunction
In the UK there are now four different ED tablets available:
Sildenafil (Viagra®).
Sildenafil (Viagra®).
Tadalafil (Cialis®).
Tadalafil (Cialis®).
Vardenafil (Levitra®).
Vardenafil (Levitra®).
Avanafil (Spedra®).
Avanafil (Spedra®).
Sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil are also available in generic (non-branded) forms.
Sildenafil and tadalafil are available from pharmacies without prescription, following a consultation with a pharmacist. The others are prescription-only.
You take a dose before you plan to have sex. They work by increasing the blood flow to your penis. They do this by affecting cGMP, the chemical involved in widening (dilating) the blood vessels of the penis when you are sexually aroused. Because of the way they work, these medicines are called phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors.
Note: none of these tablets will cause an erection unless you are sexually aroused.
PDE5 medications work in 8 out of 10 cases.
PDE5 inhibitors aren't suitable for everyone. For example, they should not be used by:
People who take nitrate medications (usually prescribed for angina) - using them together can cause a dangerously low blood pressure.
People who take nitrate medications (usually prescribed for angina) - using them together can cause a dangerously low blood pressure.
People with low blood pressure (as they can make it even lower).
People with low blood pressure (as they can make it even lower).
People who have frequent attacks of angina or angina that happens during sex - because they are likely to need nitrate medications to treat angina attacks, and the combination is dangerous.
People who have frequent attacks of angina or angina that happens during sex - because they are likely to need nitrate medications to treat angina attacks, and the combination is dangerous.
Your doctor or pharmacist can tell you more about whether or not PDE5 inhibitors are an option for you.
Switching medications
Some medicines can cause erectile dysfunction. Check the leaflet that comes with any medication that you take to see if ED is a possible side-effect. Do not stop any prescribed medication but see your doctor if you suspect this to be the cause of your ED. A switch to a different medicine may be possible, depending on what the medicine is for.
The treatments above can be prescribed or arranged by a GP. If they aren't working, they may offer you referral to see a urology specialist for further assessment, advice and treatment. Treatment options that may then be offered include:
Cream applied to the penis
Topical alprostadil may be prescribed. The cream comes with a plunger. It is applied to the tip of the penis and the surrounding skin. It should be used 5 to 30 minutes before you have sex.
Injection treatment
This was the most common treatment before ED tablets became available. It usually works very well. You are taught how to inject a medicine into the base of the penis. This causes increased blood flow, following which an erection usually develops within 15 minutes. Unlike with tablets, the erection occurs whether or not you are sexually aroused.
Urethral medication
You can place a small pellet into the end of the tube which passes urine and opens at the end of the penis (the urethra). The pellet contains a similar medicine to that used for the injection treatment. The medicine is quickly absorbed into the penis to cause an erection, usually within 10-15 minutes.
Vacuum devices (pumps)
There are several different devices. Basically, you put your penis into a plastic container. A vacuum pump then sucks out the air from the container to create a vacuum. This pulls blood flow to your penis and cause an erection.
When erect, a rubber band is placed at the base of the penis to maintain the erection. The plastic container is then taken off the penis and the penis remains erect until the rubber band is removed (which must be removed within 30 minutes).
Penile implants
Penile implants can be permanently fit into the penis by a surgeon. The most sophisticated (expensive) type can be inflated with an inbuilt pump to cause an erection. The more basic type has to be straightened by hand.
Other treatments
There are other things that are sold as erectile dysfunction treatments, such as herbal treatments and dietary supplements.
It's best to avoid these. For most of them, there is little evidence that they are effective treatments for erectile dysfunction, and they may be harmful. They also aren't regulated or tested in the same way that pharmacy medications are. For example, there are many cases of 'herbal viagra' pills that have been found to have illegal or dangerous ingredients.
Treatment for erectile dysfunction on the NHS
Generic (non-branded) sildenafil can be prescribed without restriction on the NHS.
Branded sildenafil (Viagra®), tadalafil (Cialis®), vardenafil (Levitra®), avanafil (Spedra®), and alprostadil (MUSE®, Vitaros®, Viridal Duo®, Caverject®) can only be prescribed on the NHS under the 'Selective List Scheme' (SLS) if you have one of the following specific medical condition(s) or previous treatment(s):
Diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, poliomyelitis, prostate cancer, severe pelvic injury, single-gene neurological disease (eg Huntington's disease), spina bifida, spinal cord injury, or severe pelvic injury.

How can you help a partner experiencing erectile dysfunction?
Having a partner with erectile dysfunction can be difficult and distressing for both of you, but there are lots of things that can help.
It can be a difficult topic to broach, but having an sensitive and supportive discussion about what is happening, how you both feel about it, and how you plan to move forward together, is a really important step.
It's useful to gather information about erectile dysfunction first - such as by reading this leaflet - to help you have the conversation.
Be supportive. Men with erectile dysfunction can feel ashamed or guilty. It can really help to let them know that it's not something to be ashamed of, that it doesn't change how you feel about them, and that it isn't a reflection on their masculinity.
You could explore possible solutions to the problem together. You could encourage your partner to see their doctor, or even offer to go with them, if they think that would be easier.
If talking about it is proving difficult, it might be helpful to see a couples counsellor together.
Erectile dysfunction treatment is often very effective. Sometimes, though, treatment doesn't have the desired effect. Some men might not want treatment. If this is the case, remember that there are other ways to share a physical connection, such as non-sexual touching like hugging, holding hands, and cuddling, as well as ways to have sex without an erection, like oral sex or using sex toys.

What tests are used for scrotal lumps or pain?
Your doctor will often be able to tell what kind of swelling it is just from examining you. For example, they may shine a light through your scrotum, as fluid will light up. Or they may ask you to cough which may make a hernia more obvious.
You will usually have an ultrasound scan to be sure of the cause and to find out whether you need any treatment. An ultrasound scan is a painless test that uses sound waves to create images of organs and structures inside your body. Sometimes a blood test may be helpful too.
Treatment for scrotal lumps, pains and swelling
The treatment depends on the cause. Often no treatment at all is needed. Other times - for example, in testicular torsion or testicular cancer - treatment is needed urgently. See each individual leaflet for further information on the different treatments.
NB: always see a doctor for advice about whether treatment is needed.

An epididymal cyst is a harmless fluid-filled growth on a man's testicle (testis). They are quite common and don't usually require treatment.
Many men feel them and are concerned that they have testicular cancer, but a doctor can usually tell the difference by examination and/or using an ultrasound scan.

What is an epididymal cyst?
An epididymal cyst is a harmless growth that grows from the tubes that transport sperm. The tubes are located around a man's testicle.
A cyst is just any small bulge that is filled with fluid. Cysts can grow almost anywhere in the body.
The epididymis is the name of the little tubes just above the testicle (testis). This picture shows where the epididymis is and also shows the rest of the anatomy, including the testis and vas deferens:
Cross-section view
Epididymal cyst symptoms
An epididymal cyst usually presents as a soft, slightly squidgy lump at the top or bottom of your testicle (testis). It is not usually painful and won't affect your ability to exercise, pass urine or ejaculate. They do not usually get infected.
Who develops epididymal cysts?
Men are most likely to develop these cysts during middle age. Children rarely get them before they become teenagers. It's hard to give an exact percentage of boys or men who have epididymal cysts because most people who have them don't know that they do.
Causes of epididymal cysts
We don't really know what causes epididymal cysts, though it may be that infection or inflammation might make it more likely that one will occur.
What else could it be?
Inflammation: some illnesses cause a thickening of the epididymis and surrounding structures which can feel like an epididymal cyst.

Diagnosing epididymal cysts
Usually they are quite typical in the way they feel and a doctor can confidently reassure you by undertaking a physical examination.
If the doctor isn't quite sure what the lump is, they could arrange an ultrasound scan of your scrotum - they may do this anyway even if they are pretty sure that it is an epididymal cyst, just for reassurance.
Illnesses associated with epididymal cysts
Most men with epididymal cysts are quite healthy. There are some quite rare conditions that are associated with epididymal cysts:
Cystic fibrosis: an inherited illness in which there are cysts in the lungs, pancreas and other areas of the body.

Polycystic kidney disease: an inherited condition in which cysts develop in the kidneys and other parts of the body.

Males who have epididymal cysts are not at increased risk of infertility if they are otherwise well.
Treatment for epididymal cysts
No treatment
If the cyst is small and causing no pain or discomfort, then all you need to do is keep an eye on it and see a doctor if it increases in size.
Surgical removal
Large or painful cysts can be surgically removed or treated by aspiration and injection of a substance to shrink and seal the cyst.
Children do not usually need treatment because most cysts disappear by themselves. However it may take up to four years to resolve. Surgical removal may be necessary if they become painful or don't start to shrink.
Complications of epididymal cysts
Usually epididymal cysts don't cause any problems at all. But occasionally they can twist around and become very painful. This is called torsion and happens pretty quickly: within about half an hour. It is really painful and usually needs surgery to untwist it and remove it.

In this series:
Premature ejaculation
Balanitis
Peyronie's disease
Penile cancer
Circumcision
Phimosis and paraphimosis
There are a number of penis problems that can result in penis pain, an itchy penis or general penile discomfort. For example, different types of infection or inflammation can cause itch or pain in the penis, such as thrush, herpes, and eczema. Sometimes there are other symptoms, like bumps or ulcers on the penis, or discharge from the penis.

What causes an itchy penis?
An itchy penis is often due to a fungal infection such as thrush. This is also known as candidiasis.
It can be a sign of diabetes mellitus but this most often has other symptoms too such as:
Tiredness.

Alternatively, penis itching can sometimes be a symptom of a condition called balanitis. This is the term used to describe inflammation at the head of the penis, which can also cause penis pain.
The tip of the penis may also be:
Red.

Sometimes there is bleeding or a smell coming from your foreskin, which usually develops over a few days.
Balanitis can be caused by poor hygiene and infections picked up during sexual activity or sexual intercourse, such as:

An itchy foreskin can be caused by posthitis, which means inflammation of the foreskin. This has similar causes and treatment to balanitis.
Things that can result in penile skin itching and affect the shaft of the penis include:
Thrush.

Eczema.
Eczema.
An itchy penis can also sometimes be a cause of a lower urinary tract infection in men (UTI), which can again be a source of penile discomfort and penis pain.
A doctor can often diagnose the condition just by its appearance, but sometimes tests are needed. The treatment depends on the cause.
Men's health
Spots, lumps and bumps on the penis can cause embarrassment and, for a minority of men, health and sexual function issues. We ask two specialists how blemishes on the penis are treated, what is common and what is not, and why it is important to visit a GP or sexual clinic if in doubt.

Men's health
Circumcision is an operation to remove the fold of skin, called the foreskin, that covers the tip of the penis. Circumcision is mostly performed on babies and young children, though it can be carried out at any age. It is done for both medical and religious reasons. Circumcision is available on the NHS only for medical reasons. The procedure must be arranged privately for religious, cultural, or aesthetic reasons. Although some private clinics and providers offer circumcision safely and hygienically, they may not be subject to the same standards and regulations as NHS facilities. For non-medical circumcisions, parents might weigh the risks and benefits and choose to wait until their child is old enough to participate in the decision.

What causes penis pain?
There are several causes of penis pain which we discuss in more detail below. Causes of penis pain include:
An injury due to a fall or during sports.

Peyronie's disease.
Peyronie's disease.
Peyronie's disease
In this condition, thickened areas of scar tissue (fibrous plaques) appear along the shaft of the penis. As a result the penis can develop a bend or assume a deformed shape. The exact cause is unknown but there are several theories. With Peyronie's disease, painful erections and problems with penetration during sex are common.
In most cases tests are not needed, but occasionally a scan is suggested if a blood circulation problem affecting the penis is suspected. The medical treatment includes:
Medication that can be swallowed; or
Medication that can be swallowed; or
Medicines applied directly to the surface of the penis; or

Other treatment options are available. In most cases, the condition stays the same or becomes worse, but occasionally it gets better with time.
See the separate leaflet called Peyronie's disease for additional information.
Hypospadias
Your urethra is the tube running from your bladder down the length of your penis, which your urine comes out of. Hypospadias is a malformation of the urethra and penis that some babies are born with. It can cause difficulties with the urine flow. In later life, there may be erection problems.
There are a number of different forms. In mild cases, the urethra may just open lower down from its usual position. In severe forms, it can open right down at the base of the penis, by the scrotum. Other abnormalities of the foreskin or the underside of the penis may also occur.
Tests are not usually needed unless it is suspected that the abnormalities of the penis are part of a wider disorder (such as 'intersex syndrome'). Treatment may not be needed for milder cases, but many patients require some form of corrective surgery. This is particularly true if there are problems with the direction of urine flow or erection difficulties.
See the separate leaflet called Hypospadias for additional information.
Discharge from the penis
Discharge from the penis is usually caused by inflammation of the urethra. The medical term is urethritis. You may notice a burning pain or urge to pass urine, but this doesn't always happen. Some men don't get any symptoms.
Usually, the cause is a sexually transmitted disease or infection. The common causes are:
Gonorrhoea.
Gonorrhoea.
Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU).
Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU).
It's more common in younger men, especially men who have sex with men.
As the name suggests, infections other than gonorrhoea can be a cause of NGU.
Chlamydia, a germ (bacterium) is a common cause of NGU. Irritants to the urethra can also be to blame, such as:
Soap.
Soap.
Spermicides.
Spermicides.
Putting a tube (catheter) in to drain the bladder.
Putting a tube (catheter) in to drain the bladder.
Infections causing urethritis usually need treatment to clear. You may still be infectious, even if the symptoms have gone.
If you have a discharge from the penis get checked out by your GP, a sexual health clinic, or a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic.
Don't have sex until you and your sexual partner(s) have been tested. Even after treatment, you must avoid sex until it's shown that any infection has been cleared by treatment.

Gonorrhoea.

Lumps on the penis
Many men have tiny bumps around the bottom of the head of the penis. These are called penile pearly papules (see the photo below), and are normal and harmless.

Another common cause for lumps on the penis is warts, also called anogenital warts or simply genital warts.
They look like little lumps on the outer skin of the penis.

Warts on the penis usually don't cause any penis pain or symptoms but people seek treatment because of their appearance. It's best to visit a GUM clinic to get checked out for other infections.
Genital warts are not cancers, but some types of HPV can increase the risk of certain cancers, such as:
Anal cancer.

Persistent HPV infection is the leading cause of cervical cancer.
The warts can be left alone, or removed by a variety of methods such as chemicals, freezing, burning, lasers or surgery. New warts develop after treatment in 1 in 4 cases, due to reactivation of the infection.
Condoms - both male and female - help reduce the risk of acquiring genital warts but don't abolish it because of contact with uncovered skin. Sex toys can pass on the virus and should not be shared. A vaccine is now available against HPV infection which is offered to boys and girls aged 12 to 13 years.
See the separate leaflet called Genital warts for additional information.
Circumcision
This is an operation in which the foreskin is cut off and the remaining skin stitched back. It is usually performed for a condition called phimosis. Phimosis means tightening of the foreskin. This can result in difficulties in pulling the foreskin over the head of the penis and sometimes penis pain.
If the foreskin is pulled back for cleaning or insertion of a tube (catheter) to drain the bladder, and it is not pulled forwards again, the head of the penis (glans) can swell. The foreskin can become trapped under the swollen glans: this is called a paraphimosis. It's not uncommon for this to result in penis pain.
Steroid cream or an operation to loosen the foreskin can sometimes be used if it is not too tight. Otherwise, a circumcision is required.
Sometimes a circumcision is done for religious or hygienic reasons. Other reasons include:
An infection of the glans, called balanitis (see above).

See the separate leaflet called Circumcision for additional information.
Erectile dysfunction
This is also called erectile dysfunction or impotence. There are 2 types of ED:
You can't maintain an erection long enough to complete sexual intercourse; or
You can't maintain an erection long enough to complete sexual intercourse; or
You're unable to get an erection at all.
You're unable to get an erection at all.
A lot of men have ED now and again, often as a result of stress or tiredness. It can, however, become a more persistent problem. Long-term ED is more likely to happen as you become older.
There are many causes of persistent ED, including:
Circulation problems to the penis.

Penile cancer
This is also known as penis cancer. It is very rare, affecting 1 in 100,000 men in Europe. A cancerous (malignant) tumour grows from one abnormal cell. It is not known why this happens but certain factors are known to increase the risk. These include:
Age (it is more common over the age of 50).
Age (it is more common over the age of 50).
Becoming infected with the human papillomavirus (HPV).

Certain rare skin conditions (eg, erythroplasia of Queyrat and balanitis xerotica obliterans).
Poor hygiene in adults and having phimosis can increase the risk. Having a circumcision as a baby seems to have a protective effect.
The first sign of penile cancer is an alteration in the colour of the skin either:
On the head of the penis (the glans).

Eventually, the whole of the glans and/or foreskin can become involved.
You will probably need removal of some tissue for analysis (a biopsy) and some scans to confirm the size and spread of the cancer.
