A chest infection is an infection that affects your lower large airways (bronchi) and your lungs. Pneumonia and bronchitis are the most common chest infections. Bronchitis is usually caused by a viral infection, with between 1% and 10% of cases being caused by bacteria. Pneumonia is usually due to bacterial infection. Pneumonia may be serious and need hospital admission.

A cold - often called an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) - usually starts with a combination of blocked and/or runny nose and sneezing, sometimes with a mild high temperature (fever).
You will usually get a cough, which is often dry and harsh but it can also sound like you have a lot of phlegm (sputum), which you may bring up. You may also feel tired and achy, but with the help of over-the-counter medications you'll be able to keep going with everyday activities.
Chest infections can start with these symptoms too, but you don't need to see a doctor if these are the only symptoms you have. The only exceptions are people with long-term health conditions affecting the lungs, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis. People with these conditions are more likely to develop serious complications.
What causes a chest infection?
The vast majority of URTIs are caused by viral infections. Your immune system will fight these off without any help within a few days. Because URTIs are caused by viruses rather than bacteria, antibiotics won't help in any way. See the separate leaflet called Antibiotics.
Respiratory tract infections
Read about sinusitis, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, tracheitis, pleurisy, bronchitis and pneumonia.
Sometimes an infection in the upper airways can spread deeper, causing a chest infection. Sometimes germs (bacteria) already living in your lungs can multiply, with the same result.
Types of a chest infection
There are two main types of chest infection - acute bronchitis and pneumonia.
Bronchitis is inflammation due to infection of the bronchi. '-itis' is the medical term for inflammation. It can be acute or chronic. Acute means lasting a short time and chronic means lasting a long time.
Acute bronchitis is common and is often due to a viral infection. Infection with a germ (bacterium) is a less common cause. See the separate leaflet called Acute bronchitis for more details.
This is usually a bacterial infection of the lung (bacterial chest infection) and may be serious. Treatment with antibiotics is usually needed. See the separate leaflet called Pneumonia for more details.
Chest infection recovery time
A bout of infection of the large airways (bronchi) in the lungs (acute bronchitis) usually gets better on its own within 7-10 days without any medicines. If you suspect that you have a severe infection of the lung (pneumonia), you should see a GP.
Are chest infections contagious?
You can pass a chest infection on to others through coughing and sneezing. So if you have a chest infection, it's important to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze and to wash your hands regularly. You should throw away used tissues immediately.
Chest infection treatment
Although most chest infections are mild and improve on their own, some cases can be very serious, even life-threatening.
When to see a doctor?
Infection of the large airways (bronchi) in the lungs (acute bronchitis) usually gets better by itself, so there is often no need to see a GP. However, you should contact a GP if you feel very unwell, particularly if you are feeling breathless.
If you have asthma or COPD you should take your doctor's advice.

If not, speak with them for advice if you develop chest infection symptoms.
You should also speak with a doctor or arrange a face-to-face consultation if you have a weakened immune system as it is more likely that you will need antibiotic treatment.
Warning signs of a chest infection
There are a number of chest infection symptoms that mean you should see a GP even if you do not have any other lung problems. If your symptoms get worse, you should look out for these warning signs. They include:
If a fever, wheezing or headache becomes worse or severe.

Antibiotics for a chest infection
Antibiotics are medicines used for infections caused by germs (bacteria) and don't work on viruses. Unless you have a long-term condition affecting your chest, your doctor is unlikely to prescribe antibiotics unless your symptoms and examination suggest you may have pneumonia.
Chest infection treatment at home
If you have a chest infection, you should:
Have plenty of rest.
Have plenty of rest.
Drink lots to prevent your body becoming lacking in fluids (dehydrated) and to help loosen the mucus in your lungs and make it easier to cough up.

Inhale steam vapour, perhaps with added menthol. Breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water - this can help to clear the mucus from your chest. Never use a bowl of hot water for a child's cough, in case they get scalded by accident; however, you could run a very hot bath to make the bathroom steamy and sit in the room with the child, safely away from the hot water.

What about cold and cough medicines for a chest infection?
You can buy many cold and flu remedies and cough medicines at pharmacies. These will help to make you feel better and help you to carry on with normal activities, but won't make the infection go away more quickly.
How is a chest infection diagnosed?
Your doctor will be able to make a diagnosis of a chest infection by listening to your story and examining you.
Often no tests are needed if you have infection of the large airways (bronchi) in the lungs (acute bronchitis) and your symptoms are mild. If your chest infection symptoms are more severe and you need to go to hospital then you may need to have the following tests:
A chest X-ray may be taken to be sure of the diagnosis and to see how bad the infection is.
A chest X-ray may be taken to be sure of the diagnosis and to see how bad the infection is.
Blood tests and phlegm (sputum) tests may be taken to find which germ (bacterium) is causing the serious lung infection (pneumonia). This helps to decide which antibiotic medicine is best to use. Sometimes the germ (bacterium) that is causing the pneumonia is resistant to the first antibiotic. A switch to another antibiotic is sometimes needed.

How to prevent a chest infection
There are measures you can take to help prevent chest infections and to stop the spread of it to others. For instance, washing your hands regularly reduces the chance of germs getting into your system.
What is the outlook?
Infection of the large airways (bronchi) in the lungs (acute bronchitis) usually clears without any complications. Occasionally, the infection travels to the lung tissue to cause a serious lung infection (pneumonia).
If you have pneumonia and are well enough to be looked after at home, your outlook is very good. If you need to be looked after in hospital, the outlook is still usually good - but not quite as good. The outlook is also not as good for people who also have long-term illnesses such as lung disease, heart failure or diabetes.

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infection with a germ (bacterium) called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. If you have symptoms, or a doctor can find signs of the infection when examining you, this is known as active tuberculosis. If you have TB infection without any signs or symptoms, this is known as latent TB.

Asthma inhalers
Peak flow meter for asthma
Asthma is a common condition that affects the airways. The typical symptoms are wheeze, cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. Treatment usually works well to ease and prevent symptoms.
Treatment is usually with inhalers. This leaflet gives a general overview of asthma. There are other separate leaflets in this series.

Common Questions
What is asthma?
Asthma is a condition that affects the smaller airways (bronchioles) of the lungs. From time to time the airways narrow (constrict) in people who have asthma.
This causes the typical symptoms of asthma (see below). The extent of the narrowing, and how long each episode lasts, can vary greatly.
About 8 million people in the UK have asthma, which is about 12 in every 100 people. Asthma can start at any age but it most often starts in childhood.
Asthma runs in some families but many people with asthma have no other family members affected.

Asthma symptoms
Common asthma symptoms are:
Coughing. This is usually a dry cough, and often made worse by asthma triggers like cold air, exercise, or allergens.

Feeling of chest tightness. Some people feel like their chest feels tight, or like there is a dull ache or sharp pain in the chest.
Feeling of chest tightness. Some people feel like their chest feels tight, or like there is a dull ache or sharp pain in the chest.
Asthma symptoms can range from mild to severe between different people and at different times in the same person. Each episode of asthma symptoms could last for an hour or so, or persist for days or weeks unless treated.
Mild untreated asthma
Mild asthma symptoms can occur from time to time. For example, a mild wheeze and a cough with a cold or a chest infection. Mild symptoms may also occur during the hay fever season, or with exercise.
Most of the time there may be no asthma symptoms at all. A child with mild asthma may have an irritating cough each night but is often fine during the day.
Moderate untreated asthma
Typically there are episodes of wheezing and coughing from time to time. Sometimes breathless may occur. There is usually spells without symptoms. However, wheezing tends to occur for some of the time on most days.
Symptoms are often worse at night, or first thing in the morning. Symptoms may include waking some nights coughing or with a tight chest.
Young children may not have typical symptoms. It may be difficult to tell the difference between asthma and recurring chest infections in young children.
Severe asthma attack
A severe asthma attack causes severe wheezing, a tight chest and difficulty in breathing. It may be difficult to talk because of being severely breathless.
People with a severe asthma attack usually look, and feel, very unwell. A severe asthma attack needs emergency medical treatment.
Severe symptoms may develop suddenly in some people who usually just have mild or moderate symptoms.
When to see a doctor about asthma
It is very important to see a doctor if there is any concern that an adult or child has asthma. Several conditions can cause similar symptoms, so it's important to get a proper diagnosis and correct treatment. The doctor will usually be able to diagnose asthma by asking about symptoms and carrying out some simple tests.

If you already have asthma, see a doctor or nurse if the symptoms become worse and cannot be controlled by the usual treatments.
People with asthma should also have a review each year at their GP surgery to check up on the asthma, and how it is affecting them.
A severe asthma attack, especially with difficulty breathing that does not respond to usual asthma treatment, is a medical emergency. Call an ambulance immediately.
What causes asthma?
The symptoms of asthma are caused by inflammation (swelling) in the airways of the lungs, which may be triggered by different things in different people. The inflammation causes the muscles around the airways to squeeze (contract).
This causes narrowing of the airways. It is then more difficult for air to get in and out of the lungs. This leads to wheezing and breathlessness. The inflammation also causes the lining of the airways to make extra mucus which causes cough and further blockage to the airflow.
The following diagram below shows how an episode of asthma develops.
How asthma develops
Asthma symptoms may flare up from time to time. There is often no obvious reason why asthma symptoms flare up.
Asthma triggers
However, some people find that symptoms are triggered, or made worse, in certain situations. It may be possible to avoid certain triggers, which may help to reduce symptoms. Things that may trigger asthma symptoms include the following:
Infections - particularly colds, coughs and chest infections.

Certain medicines - for example, about 1 in 50 people with asthma are allergic to aspirin, which can trigger symptoms. Other medicines that may cause asthma symptoms include:
Anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen (for example, Nurofen®), diclofenac, etc.
Beta-blockers such as propranolol, atenolol, or timolol. This includes beta-blocker eye drops used to treat glaucoma.

Other fumes and chemicals - for example, fumes from paints, solvents and pollution. The increase in air pollution may be a reason why asthma is becoming more common. Details about current levels of air pollution, are available from The Daily Air Quality Index, which can be found on the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) website (see further reading for link).

Some people only develop asthma symptoms when exposed to a certain trigger - for example, exercise-induced asthma. However, there are some people who only develop symptoms when they exercise; the rest of the time they are fine. Another example is that some people only develop symptoms when exposed to specific chemicals.
Asthma treatment
For most people with asthma, the symptoms can be prevented most of the time with treatment. This allows a person with asthma to get on with a normal life at school, work, sport, etc.
Inhalers. Inhalers are the main treatment for people with asthma. Inhalers deliver a small dose of medicine directly to the airways. The dose is enough to treat the airways. However, the amount of medicine that gets into the rest of the body is small so side-effects are unlikely, or minor.
There are various inhaler devices made by different companies. Different ones suit different people. A doctor or nurse will advise on the different types. See the separate leaflet called Asthma inhalers for more details.
Bone strength (density) may be reduced following long-term use of high doses of inhaled steroids. Therefore people who regularly use steroid inhalers for asthma need to make sure they have a good supply of calcium in their diet. Milk and dairy are good sources of calcium. Other good dietary sources of calcium include bread, some vegetables (curly kale, okra, spinach and watercress) and some fruits (for example, dried apricots). See the separate leaflet called Preventing steroid-induced osteoporosis for more details.
Inhalers contain different types of medication. Inhalers can have one medication or a combination of different ones. There are three main types of medication in inhalers: short-acting relievers, inhaled steroids or preventers, and long-acting relievers or bronchodilators:
Short-acting relievers. These contain a medicine called a short-acting bronchodilator. These medications relax the muscles in the airways, causing the airways to open up quickly. The effect lasts for a short time - usually only a few hours. There are several different reliever medicines - for example, salbutamol (Ventolin®)and terbutaline.

Short-acting relievers only treat the symptoms of asthma and not the underlying cause, which is inflammation (swelling) in the airways. People with asthma shouldn't use short-acting relievers as their only asthma treatment. It is much better to use an anti-inflammatory reliever, or to use a regular preventer (inhaled steroid) alongside a short-acting reliever (see below).
If you have asthma and only use a short-acting reliever inhaler, speak to your doctor or nurse about a change in treatment.
Inhaled steroids in preventer inhalers. This is taken every day to prevent symptoms from developing. The medicine commonly used in preventer inhalers is a steroid. Steroids work by reducing the inflammation in the airways. When the inflammation has gone, the airways are much less likely to become narrow and cause symptoms. It takes 7-14 days for the steroid in a preventer inhaler to build up its effect. Therefore, it will not give any immediate relief of symptoms. However, after a week or so of treatment, the symptoms have often gone, or are much reduced. It can take up to six weeks for maximum benefit. The preventer inhaler should be used every day even when symptoms have gone - this is to prevent symptoms from coming back. A reliever inhaler should then not be needed very often (if at all).
Long-acting bronchodilators. These are sometimes added alongside inhaled steroids in preventer inhalers. Long-acting bronchodilators relieve symptoms as they widen the lung airways but work for longer than reliever inhalers. The medicines in these inhalers work for up to 12 hours after each dose has been taken. They include salmeterol and formoterol. (Some brands of inhaler contain a steroid plus a long-acting bronchodilator for convenience.) A long-acting bronchodilator may be needed if symptoms are not fully controlled by the preventer inhaler alone.
Spacer devices. These devices are used with some types of inhaler. They are commonly used by children; however, many adults also use them. A spacer is like a small plastic chamber that attaches to the inhaler. It holds the medicine like a reservoir when the inhaler is pressed. A valve at the mouth end makes sure that the medicine is kept within the spacer until breathing it in. When breathing out, the valve closes. Spacers make it much easier to use inhalers so that the medication gets into the lungs, where it needs to be. A face mask can be fitted on to some types of spacers instead of a mouthpiece. This is sometimes done for babies and young children who can then use the inhaler simply by breathing in and out normally through the mask.
Inhalers. Inhalers are the main treatment for people with asthma. Inhalers deliver a small dose of medicine directly to the airways. The dose is enough to treat the airways. However, the amount of medicine that gets into the rest of the body is small so side-effects are unlikely, or minor.

People with asthma shouldn't use short-acting relievers as their only asthma treatment. It is much better to use an anti-inflammatory reliever, or to use a regular preventer (inhaled steroid) alongside a short-acting reliever (see below).
If you have asthma and only use a short-acting reliever inhaler, speak to your doctor or nurse about a change in treatment.
Short-acting relievers. These contain a medicine called a short-acting bronchodilator. These medications relax the muscles in the airways, causing the airways to open up quickly.

Inhaled steroids in preventer inhalers. This is taken every day to prevent symptoms from developing. The medicine commonly used in preventer inhalers is a steroid. Steroids work by reducing the inflammation in the airways. When the inflammation has gone, the airways are much less likely to become narrow and cause symptoms. It takes 7-14 days for the steroid in a preventer inhaler to build up its effect. Therefore, it will not give any immediate relief of symptoms. However, after a week or so of treatment, the symptoms have often gone, or are much reduced. It can take up to six weeks for maximum benefit. The preventer inhaler should be used every day even when symptoms have gone - this is to prevent symptoms from coming back. A reliever inhaler should then not be needed very often (if at all).

Long-acting bronchodilators. These are sometimes added alongside inhaled steroids in preventer inhalers. Long-acting bronchodilators relieve symptoms as they widen the lung airways but work for longer than reliever inhalers. The medicines in these inhalers work for up to 12 hours after each dose has been taken. They include salmeterol and formoterol. (Some brands of inhaler contain a steroid plus a long-acting bronchodilator for convenience.) A long-acting bronchodilator may be needed if symptoms are not fully controlled by the preventer inhaler alone.

Spacer devices. These devices are used with some types of inhaler. They are commonly used by children; however, many adults also use them. A spacer is like a small plastic chamber that attaches to the inhaler. It holds the medicine like a reservoir when the inhaler is pressed. A valve at the mouth end makes sure that the medicine is kept within the spacer until breathing it in. When breathing out, the valve closes. Spacers make it much easier to use inhalers so that the medication gets into the lungs, where it needs to be. A face mask can be fitted on to some types of spacers instead of a mouthpiece. This is sometimes done for babies and young children who can then use the inhaler simply by breathing in and out normally through the mask.

Tablets to open up the airways. Most people do not need tablets, as inhalers usually work well. However, in some cases a tablet (or medicine in liquid form for children) is prescribed in addition to inhalers if symptoms are not fully eased by inhalers alone. Various tablets may be used which aim to open up the airways. Some young children use liquid medication instead of inhalers. Tablets used for asthma include:
Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs). Chemicals called leukotrienes are produced in some people who have asthma which is triggered by an allergic reaction (for example, pollen) or sometimes exercise. LTRAs such as montelukast act by blocking the action of these chemicals. Montelukast comes in the form of tablets or granules. In people whose asthma is not well controlled by a reliever inhaler and a preventer inhaler, NICE recommends trying an LTRA before adding a long-acting bronchodilator inhaler.
Steroid tablets. A short course of steroid tablets (such as prednisolone) is sometimes needed to ease a severe or prolonged attack of asthma. Steroid tablets are good at reducing the inflammation in the airways. For example, a severe attack may occur with a cold or a chest infection. Some people worry about taking steroid tablets. However, a short course of steroid tablets (for a week) usually works very well and is unlikely to cause side-effects. Most of the side-effects caused by steroid tablets occur if they are taken for a long time (more than several months), or after a lot of short courses of high-dose steroids over a short period of time.

Biologic therapies. Monoclonal antibodies are biologic treatments used for treating many diseases. They work by targeting specific cells and proteins to make the disease better. In asthma, they work by interfering with the immune system to reduce inflammation in the airways. These are medicines that are only used in a small number of people who have severe persistent allergic asthma that have not been controlled by other treatments. So, it is not a common treatment.

They are most commonly given by injection. These treatments can only be started by a specialist. Each medication has its own rules on when they can be started by a specialist. If needed, an asthma specialist will go into much more detail about that specific one.
What are the dosages of treatment?
Everyone is different. The correct dose of a preventer inhaler is the lowest dose that prevents symptoms. A doctor may prescribe a high dose of a preventer inhaler at first, to 'get on top of symptoms' quickly. When symptoms have gone, the dose may then be reduced by a little every few weeks. The aim is to find the lowest regular dose that keeps symptoms away.
Some people with asthma put up with symptoms. They may think that it is normal still to have some symptoms even when they are on treatment. A common example is a night-time cough which can cause disturbed sleep.
But, if this occurs and symptoms are not fully controlled, it is very important to see a doctor or nurse for an asthma review. Symptoms can often be prevented - for example, by adjusting the dose of the preventer inhaler, or by adding in a long-acting bronchodilator.
A typical treatment plan for asthma
The recommendations on asthma treatment plans have recently changed. A common treatment plan for someone with asthma, especially children, is:
A preventer inhaler (usually a steroid inhaler), taken each morning and at bedtime. This usually prevents symptoms throughout the day and night.
A preventer inhaler (usually a steroid inhaler), taken each morning and at bedtime. This usually prevents symptoms throughout the day and night.
A reliever inhaler may be needed now and then if breakthrough symptoms occur. For example, if symptoms flare up with a cough or cold.
A reliever inhaler may be needed now and then if breakthrough symptoms occur. For example, if symptoms flare up with a cough or cold.
There is a newer way of using inhalers, though, which seems to work better for many people, called maintenance-and-reliever therapy, or MART. MART involves:
Using a single inhaler that contains a bronchodilator or reliever called formeterol, and an inhaled steroid. Formeterol is a long-acting reliever but starts to work quickly, meaning it gives quick relief from symptoms.

Many people are switching over to MART instead of using two separate reliever and preventer inhalers, as it is simpler and seems to work better for treating asthma and preventing asthma attacks.. Speak to your doctor or nurse if you would like to see if it's an option for you.
People with asthma should have a written asthma action plan agreed with their doctor or nurse, which explains how to use their inhalers, and what to do if their symptoms get worse.
Asthma action plan
An asthma action plan is a plan agreed by anyone with asthma with a doctor or nurse. The plan enables changes to the dose of the inhalers, depending on symptoms and/or peak flow readings. The plan is tailored to each individual. It is written down, usually on a standard form, so that it's clear what to do at any time.
The plan should include:
What to do when unwell - for example, with a cold - and when to seek help.

What to do if symptoms become worse with hay fever or exercise.

A discussion on ways to reduce exposure to air pollution, both indoors and outdoors. If asthma is triggered by household sprays, air fresheners or aerosols, it is important to avoid using them or use non-spray alternatives instead. Mould and house dust mites in the home can also make asthma worse. If problems with mould in the home, a doctor can sometimes help request a housing assessment from the local authority.

Research studies suggest that people who complete personal asthma action plans find it easier to manage their asthma symptoms and that their plan helps them to go about their lives as normal. Asthma+Lung UK provides asthma action plans which can be downloaded (see 'Further Reading' below).
Asthma diagnosis
In the past, many cases of asthma were diagnosed on the basis of typical symptoms and without any tests. However, this can lead to mistakes, so it's now recommended that people should also have one or more tests to confirm asthma before making the diagnosis.
It's not always possible to do these tests straight away, so doctors might recommend trying asthma treatment anyway whilst waiting for tests, particularly if someone has troublesome symptoms or is very unwell.
There are various different tests that might be used, such as:
FeNO test. FeNO stands for fractional exhaled nitrous oxide. It measures the amount of nitrous oxide in the breath. Raised levels of nitrous oxide mean that there is inflammation in the airways of the lungs, which can be used to confirm a diagnosis of asthma. It is sometimes also used as a monitoring test for people with asthma; if it is raised, it suggests that they are not getting enough inhaled steroid to reduce inflammation in the lungs. Some GP surgeries have access to a FeNO test, but others may need to refer to a specialist to get it.

A blood test for eosinophils. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that can be raised due to several different conditions, including asthma. If someone has typical symptoms of asthma, and a raised blood eosinophil level, this confirms the diagnosis of asthma.

Spirometry. Spirometry is a test which measures how much air can be blown out into a machine called a spirometer. Two results are important:
The amount of air that can be blown out in one second - called forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).
The total amount that can be blown out in one breath - called forced vital capacity (FVC).

The total amount that can be blown out in one breath - called forced vital capacity (FVC).
Age, height and sex affect lung volume. So, spirometry results are compared with a graph showing the average predicted for age, height and sex. A value is calculated from the amount of air that can be blown out in one second divided by the total amount of air that can be blown out in one breath (called FEV1:FVC ratio). A low value indicates narrowed airways which are typical in asthma (but a low value can occur in other conditions too). Therefore, spirometry may be repeated after treatment with a reliever inhaler. An improvement in the value after treatment to open up the airways, is typical of asthma. Note: spirometry may be normal in people with asthma who do not have any symptoms when the test is done. Remember, the symptoms of asthma typically come and go. Therefore, a normal result does not rule out asthma. However, if symptoms suggest asthma, ideally the test should be repeated when symptoms are present.
See the separate leaflet called Spirometry for more details.
Assessment with a peak flow meter. This is an alternative test. A peak flow meter is a small device to blow into. A doctor or nurse will demonstrate how to use a peak flow meter. It measures the speed of air that can be blow out of the lungs. If the airways are narrowed, the peak flow reading will be lower than expected for age, height and sex. Untreated asthma will usually cause low and variable peak flow readings. Also with asthma, peak flow readings in the morning are usually lower than in the evening. It is useful to keep a diary of peak flow readings over about two weeks. Typically, a person with asthma will usually have low and variable peak flow readings over several days. Peak flow readings improve when the narrowed airways are opened up with treatment. Regular peak flow readings can be used to help assess how well the treatment is working. See the separate leaflet called Peak Flow Meter for Asthma and our editorial article called Peak flow diary for more details.

Other tests. If the diagnosis remains in doubt then a specialist may perform further, more complex tests. However, these are not needed in most cases. Although not recommended for diagnosis, allergy tests may be used to identify any asthma triggers after a diagnosis of asthma has been made. See also the separate leaflet called Allergies.

Diagnosing asthma in children under 5 years old. Children under 5 often can't do the tests above accurately. So guidelines recommend that if a doctor suspects that an under 5-year-old has asthma, they offer treatment based on symptoms. However, once they reach the age of 5, they should have one or more of the tests above if they still have symptoms.

However, once they reach the age of 5, they should have one or more of the tests above if they still have symptoms.
The tests above can sometimes be normal even in people who do have asthma. The results can also be affected by asthma treatment - they may be normal if the treatment is working well. So a normal result doesn't necessarily mean that someone does not have asthma; the results need to be interpreted looking at the overall picture of your symptoms and response to treatment.
Common Questions
Does asthma go away?
For many people, asthma is a life-long condition. There is no cure for asthma, but daily treatment can keep asthma under good control.
Asthma does sometimes go away in some people. About half of children with asthma find that asthma symptoms go away completely by the time they are adults. However, for some of them, asthma symptoms return later in life, particularly if they are exposed to an asthma trigger such as pollution or smoking.
Some adults also find that their asthma improves with time; studies suggest that, in around 1 in 10 to 3 in 10 adults with asthma, their asthma symptoms improve and may disappear over decades. This is more likely in people with mild asthma, and in people who started treatment early on for their asthma.
For many adults, asthma is variable with some good spells and some spells that are not so good. Some people are worse in the winter months and some are worse in the hay fever season. Although not curable, asthma is treatable. Stepping up the treatment for a while during bad spells will often control symptoms.
Don't underestimate asthma
Because modern management is so effective, many people with asthma are well controlled. However, this has led to the belief that asthma is a mild and even trivial condition.
The fact is that when asthma goes wrong, it can do so quickly. Deaths from asthma are rising. More than 1,400 people died from asthma in 2020, representing an increase of nearly 4% over the previous year..
There are several things to lower the risk of asthma getting out of control:
Make sure you are accessing basic asthma care. This should involve at least an annual review from your GP or asthma nurse, including an inhaler technique check. You should be given a written asthma action plan.

"It's only asthma" is not a phrase that should pass anybody's lips.
Is asthma genetic?
Asthma is a complex condition with lots of different causes. Genetics aren't the only cause, but they might play a role. People with a family history of asthma are more likely to get asthma themselves. It's likely that people inherit a number of different gene variants which make them more likely to get asthma - for example, they might be more vulnerable to environmental triggers for asthma.
Is asthma a disability?
Asthma can be a disability, depending on how it is affecting someone.
In the UK, a disability is defined by the Equality Act 2010 as a condition that has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on a person's ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.
So, someone with well-controlled asthma who has little or no symptoms is unlikely to be considered as having a disability, but someone whose asthma is significantly affecting their day-to-day life might be.
Silent asthma attack symptoms
A 'silent' asthma attack is when someone has an asthma attack but without the typical symptom of feeling or sounding wheezy. They might not realise that they are having an asthma attack, and this can delay them getting treatment.
Symptoms of a silent asthma attack can include:
Feeling breathless, short of breath, or having difficulty breathing.

Feeling tightness in the chest.

Coughing.

Feeling very fatigued (tired) or exhausted.
Breathing harder or faster than normal.
Breathing harder or faster than normal.
Some people with asthma find it really hard to tell that they are having an asthma attack until they become extremely unwell. This can happen in brittle asthma.
Can you develop asthma as an adult?
Asthma can develop at any age, although it's more common to develop in childhood. Asthma that develops in adulthood is called adult-onset asthma.
Some other general points about asthma
It is vital to learn how to use inhalers correctly. In some people, symptoms persist simply because they do not use their inhaler properly and the medicine from the inhaler does not get into the airways properly. See a pharmacist or practice nurse if you are not sure if you are using asthma inhalers properly.

Pneumonia is a lung infection that causes inflammation and swelling in the air sacs (alveoli). These sacs can fill with fluid, making it harder to breathe and for oxygen to reach the bloodstream. It's usually caused by bacterial infections but can also be caused by viral infections, and sometimes fungi.
This leaflet explains the types, causes, symptoms, treatment, and prevention of pneumonia.

What is pneumonia?
Pneumonia is inflammation of the lungs. Pneumonia can affect one or both lungs, and you can even have it without knowing it. This is sometimes called walking pneumonia.
Anyone can get pneumonia, but it mostly affects people younger than 5 or over the age of 65 due to their weakened immune systems. Smoking and alcohol consumption may also raise your risk of catching pneumonia.
Pneumonia is often more serious than bronchitis, which is the inflammation or infection of the large airways called the bronchi (see diagram). It's possible to have both conditions at the same time, known as bronchopneumonia.
Pneumonia patch diagram
Types of pneumonia
Pneumonia is usually classified based on where it is acquired. For example, it can be hospital-acquired or community-acquired. Sometimes, it is classified by how the infection is caught, such as aspiration pneumonia.
Hospital-acquired pneumonia
Hospital-acquired pneumonia is a lung infection that develops at least 48 hours after being admitted to the hospital and was not present when you were admitted. This is different from ventilator-associated pneumonia, which occurs more than 48 hours after a patient has been put on a ventilator.
Hospital acquired pneumonia is more common in patients in the intensive care unit, those who have recently had major surgery, or those who have been in the hospital for a long time. Symptoms usually include fever or low body temperature, thick mucus, and difficulty getting enough oxygen
Aspiration pneumonia
A particular type of pneumonia is known as aspiration pneumonia.
This occurs when small amounts of stomach contents or liquids from the mouth or throat are inhaled into the lungs. These inhaled substances can irritate the lungs, cause infection, or block the smaller airways.
Aspiration pneumonia usually affects frail elderly people, those who are drowsy or unconscious, or individuals with conditions that cause swallowing difficulties.

How to tell if it's pneumonia or the flu?
Coughing up a lot of phlegm (sputum) is more likely to happen in pneumonia than in flu. The phlegm may become yellow-coloured or green-coloured. It may be streaked with blood, or you may cough up more significant amounts of blood.
You may become short of breath, start breathing faster than normal, and develop a tight chest. If the infection involves the pleura (the membrane between the lung and the chest wall), you might feel a sharp pain in the side of your chest. A doctor may hear crackles when listening to your chest with a stethoscope.
How long does pneumonia last?
The duration of pneumonia depends on the severity of the illness and who gets it. According to the NHS, it may take up to 6 months to feel completely back to normal. However, symptoms should have substantially reduced in mild cases after 4 to 6 weeks.
When should you see a doctor for pneumonia?
Who you see depends on your symptoms and how unwell you feel. Seek appropriate care based on the severity of your condition. For example, if you experience severe difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion or disorientation, seek emergency care by calling an ambulance.
If you have asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and feel unwell you should ask your doctor for advice.
Your doctor may recommend increasing your inhaler medication or using a 'rescue pack' of antibiotics and steroid tablets at the first sign of an infection. For those with asthma, this information might be included in your personalised asthma action plan. If it is not, consult your doctor for advice if you develop symptoms of a chest infection.
There are a number of pneumonia symptoms that mean you should see a healthcare professional, including a GP, even if you do not have any other lung problems. They include:
If a fever, wheezing or headache becomes worse or severe.

Causes of pneumonia
Pneumonia is an infection commonly caused by bacteria or viruses. Bacteria causes bacterial pneumonia and viruses cause viral pneumonia.
Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria is the most common cause in both adults and children. Other bacterial causes include Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus.
Respiratory viruses such as flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles virus and coronavirus can cause viral pneumonia, which is usually milder than bacterial pneumonia. However, those with viral pneumonia are at risk of getting bacterial pneumonia.
A well-known group of bacteria called atypicals, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, causes pneumonia in about 3 out of 10 cases. Other germs, such as fungi, yeasts, or protozoa, can sometimes also cause pneumonia.
Rarely, pneumonia can be caused by inhaling poisons or chemicals rather than an infection. Many different substances, including liquids, gases, small particles, dust, or fumes, can cause this.
You may breathe in bacteria, viruses, or other germs. If you are normally healthy, a small number of germs usually does not matter. They will be trapped in your phlegm (sputum) and killed by your immune system. However, sometimes the germs multiply and cause lung infections.
Risk factors for pneumonia
You are more likely to catch pneumonia if you are already in poor health or have certain health conditions, for example:
If you are frail or elderly.

How is pneumonia diagnosed?
A doctor will suspect pneumonia by asking about your symptoms. They may also ask about:
Your medical history and that of your family.

Chest X-ray
A chest X-ray may be required to confirm the diagnosis and to see how serious the infection is.
Other tests
These tests are usually carried out if you need to be admitted to hospital. They include sending a sample of phlegm (sputum) for analysis and blood tests to check if the infection has spread to your blood.
Pneumonia treatment
You may need medications to treat your pneumonia, depending on the cause and type of pneumonia.
Medications
Treating pneumonia at home may be sufficient if you are normally healthy and the pneumonia is not severe.
If the doctor thinks you have pneumonia, an antibiotic such as amoxicillin is prescribed. Once pneumonia is diagnosed, it's best to start treatment within four hours and complete the prescribed course. Bacterial infection is a common cause, and antibiotic medications kill bacteria. However, antibiotic medicines don't work against viruses.
Amoxicillin is usually effective against the most common causes. If it doesn't seem to be effective and your doctor suspects a less common bacterial infection, they may change your medication.
If you are allergic to penicillin (amoxicillin is a type of penicillin), your doctor will prescribe an alternative, such as clarithromycin, that works just as well. Antibiotics in capsule, tablet, or liquid form are preferred to injections through a vein (intravenous), provided you can take them.
Antibiotic treatment is usually effective, and you can expect to recover fully. If the treatment is working, symptoms should start to improve after three days. In most cases, antibiotics can be stopped in five days unless you are still very unwell.
Self-care
During your recovery, ensure you:
Have lots to drink, to avoid becoming lacking in fluid in the body (dehydrated).

Let a doctor know if symptoms do not improve over the following three days.
You may feel tired for a while after the infection has cleared. If the symptoms persist for longer than three weeks, you should ask your doctor to check you again.
Hospital treatment
Hospital admission may be advised if you have severe pneumonia or if symptoms do not quickly improve after you have started antibiotic treatment.
You are more likely to be treated in hospital if you are already in poor health, or if an infection with a more serious infecting germ is suspected. For example, if infection with Legionella pneumophila (the bacterium that causes Legionnaires' disease) is suspected.
Even if you are in hospital, you are likely to be offered antibiotics in capsule, tablet or liquid form unless you have difficulties taking them, in which case they may be given through a vein. If the condition is thought to be severe, you may only be given antibiotics through a vein. Your antibiotic treatment will be stopped after five days, unless you are very unwell.
Sometimes oxygen and other supportive treatments are needed if you have severe pneumonia. Those who become severely unwell may need treatment in an intensive care unit or high dependency unit.
When you return home, even though the infection is treated, you may feel tired and unwell for some time.
Complications of pneumonia
Pneumonia can cause complications, especially in people with existing health conditions, those who are frail, or patients with weakened immune systems.
Potential complications include:
Fluid buildup around the lungs can occur in the pleura, which are thin membranes lining the lungs and the inside of the chest wall. This condition is called pleural effusion and can cause chest pain and difficulty breathing. It is often necessary to drain the excess fluid, especially if it is infected.

How to prevent pneumonia
Certain protective measures can help prevent some types of pneumonia or reduce the severity and duration of the illness. These include:
Vaccination
One of the most effective ways to prevent pneumonia is through immunisation against pneumococcus, the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia.

Lifestyle changes
Other prevention measures include maintaining a healthy lifestyle and washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Cigarette smoke damages the lining of the airways and makes the lungs more prone to infection. Therefore, stopping smoking will reduce your risk of developing lung infections.
Frequently asked questions
Is pneumonia contagious?
Pneumonia can be contagious, depending on the cause. Bacterial and viral pneumonia can spread through coughs, sneezes, or by touching contaminated surfaces. However, not everyone exposed to these germs will develop pneumonia.
Is pneumonia deadly?
Pneumonia can be deadly, especially in older adults, people with weak immune systems, or severe cases needing hospital care. Most healthy people recover well at home, with deaths being rare.
Can pneumonia go away on its own?
Mild cases of viral pneumonia can clear up on its own with rest and fluids, but bacterial pneumonia usually needs antibiotics. Without treatment, pneumonia can get worse and cause serious complications.

Acute exacerbations of COPD
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a long-term condition of the lungs where the flow of air to the lungs is obstructed. Symptoms include cough and breathlessness. The condition is most often caused by smoking and the most important treatment is to stop smoking. Inhalers are commonly used to ease symptoms. Other treatments such as steroids, antibiotics, oxygen, and mucus-thinning (mucolytic) medicines are sometimes prescribed in more severe cases, or during a flare-up (exacerbation) of symptoms.

What is COPD?
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common and preventable condition. Chronic means persistent. Obstructive describes the prevention of the usual flow of air into the lungs. Pulmonary means 'to do with the lungs'. It is a long-term illness or disease.
COPD is now the preferred name for the type of airflow obstruction which in the past was called chronic bronchitis, emphysema or chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD). The obstruction is due to damage to the airways of the lungs. This in turn is the result of the airways being exposed to poisonous substances such as tobacco smoke and indoor or outdoor air pollution.
The word emphysema describes a type of lung damage that occurs in COPD - see the separate leaflet called Emphysema.
Chest and lungs
In the UK, 1.2 million people are affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - the name for a group of lung conditions that cause breathing difficulties. COPD can make it harder for people to do the activities they love. However, there are ways you can live a full, healthy life with COPD.

Emphysema is a progressive lung condition that is a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Smoking is the most common cause of emphysema.
by Dr Philippa Vincent, MRCGP
How common is COPD?
COPD is common and important. It is estimated that about three million people in the UK have COPD. However, in many of these people (perhaps as many as two million), the condition has not been formally diagnosed (normally these would be mild cases). This is because in the early stages, many people put up with a cough or mild breathlessness without seeing their doctor, perhaps dismissing it as a 'smoker's cough'. They may only see their doctor when symptoms get worse.
Worldwide, it is believed that nearly 12 in every 100 people have COPD, and there are 3 million deaths each year from COPD.
COPD mainly affects people over the age of 40 and becomes more common with increasing age. It is usually diagnosed in people over the age of 50. It is more common in men than in women.
A flare-up (exacerbation) of COPD is one of the most common reasons for admission to hospital. 1 in 8 emergency hospital admissions are due to COPD. This makes COPD the second largest cause of emergency admissions, and one of the most expensive inpatient conditions treated by the NHS.
People with COPD commonly have other diseases as well - such as cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, osteoporosis, depression and anxiety.
What causes COPD?
Smoking is the cause in most cases. It is by far the biggest risk factor for COPD. The lining of the airways becomes inflamed and damaged by smoking. Cigarette smoking is the biggest risk factor, but other types of smoking can lead to a risk of developing COPD:
Passive smoking - regularly being in the presence of secondhand smoke due to others smoking.

Air pollution may cause some cases of COPD, or make the disease worse. Air pollution can be indoor air pollution or outdoor air pollution. Indoor air pollution seems to be involved in more cases of COPD than outdoor air pollution. Indoor air pollution includes fumes from indoor fires or stoves, and dusts, fumes or chemicals present in some workplaces. The combination effect of long-term exposure at work to air pollutants and smoking increases the chances of developing COPD.
A small number of people have a hereditary (genetic) risk of COPD due to very rare protein deficiencies that can lead to lung, liver and blood disorders. (The condition is called alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency). Less than 1 in 100 cases of COPD are due to this.
COPD symptoms
Cough is usually the first symptom to develop. It is productive with phlegm (sputum). It tends to come and go at first, and then gradually becomes more persistent (chronic). You may think of your cough as a 'smoker's cough' in the early stages of the disease, but this doesn't mean you should dismiss it - indeed, a 'smoker's cough' is a reason to see your GP. It is when the breathlessness begins that people often become concerned.

It is when the breathlessness begins that people often become concerned.
Breathlessness (shortness of breath) and wheeze may occur only when you exert yourself at first. For example, when you climb stairs. These symptoms tend to become gradually worse over the years if you continue to smoke. Difficulty with breathing may eventually become quite distressing.

Chest infections (also known as respiratory infections) are more common if you have COPD. A sudden worsening of symptoms (such as when you have an infection) is called an exacerbation. Wheezing with cough and breathlessness may become worse than usual if you have a chest infection and you may cough more sputum. Sputum usually turns yellow or green during a chest infection. Chest infections can be caused by germs called bacteria or viruses. Bacteria (which can be killed using antibiotic medicines) cause about 1 in 2 or 3 exacerbations of COPD. Viruses (which cannot be killed with antibiotics) are a common cause of exacerbations too, particularly in the winter months. The common cold virus may be responsible for up to 1 in 3 exacerbations.

Chest pain and coughing up blood (haemoptysis) are not common features of COPD. It is possible to have slightly blood-streaked sputum when you have a chest infection. However, chest pain, blood in the sputum or coughing up just blood, should always be reported to a doctor. This is because other conditions need to be excluded (such as angina, heart attack or lung cancer).
What is the difference between COPD and asthma?
COPD and asthma cause similar symptoms - in particular difficulty breathing (breathlessness). However, they are completely different diseases. Briefly:
In COPD there is permanent damage to the airways. The narrowed airways are fixed, and so symptoms are persistent (chronic). Treatment to open up the airways is therefore limited.
In COPD there is permanent damage to the airways. The narrowed airways are fixed, and so symptoms are persistent (chronic). Treatment to open up the airways is therefore limited.
In asthma there is inflammation in the airways which makes the muscles in the airways narrow (constrict). This is temporary so the narrowing comes and goes. So, the symptoms tend to come and go, and vary in severity from time to time. Treatment to reduce inflammation and to open up the airways usually works well.

Both asthma and COPD are common, and some people have both conditions - this is known as Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome, or ACOS. See the separate leaflet called Asthma for more details.
Diagnosing COPD
COPD may be suspected by your doctor because of your symptoms. Examination of your chest can be normal in mild or early COPD. Using a stethoscope, your doctor may hear wheezes in your chest, or find signs of a chest infection.
Your chest may show signs of being over-inflated (hyperinflation). This is because the airways are obstructed and, as well as it being difficult for air to get into your lungs, it is also difficult for it to escape. Your symptoms (history) and physical examination will help your GP decide if COPD is likely.
Spirometry
The most common test used in helping to diagnose the condition is called spirometry, also known as lung function tests. This is a breathing test which can be done in your GP surgery, or may be done at a different clinic. You will be asked to breathe or blow into a small machine called a spirometer which will measure how well your lungs are working. As well as helping to make the diagnosis of COPD, spirometry might point your GP in the direction of a different diagnosis, such as pulmonary fibrosis. It is also sometimes used to monitor the progression of COPD.
This test can help make a diagnosis of COPD. It also divides COPD into four stages of severity depending on the results. To read more about spirometry and the four stages of COPD, see the separate leaflet called Spirometry.
Other tests
A chest X-ray may show signs of COPD and can be used to help exclude other serious conditions (including lung cancer). Occasionally, a special CT scan of the chest - high-resolution CT - is needed.
A blood test to make sure you are not anaemic is often helpful. If you are anaemic, you have a tendency to be lacking in iron, and anaemia can lead to breathlessness. Sometimes a blood test can show changes (called polycythaemia) that suggest you have persistently low levels of oxygen (hypoxia).
A pulse oximeter is a device which can be clipped on to your finger. It measures your heart rate (pulse) and the amount of oxygen in your circulation (oxygen saturation). Lower levels than normal tend to be found in people who have COPD, especially if you have a flare-up (exacerbation) of your symptoms.
How does COPD progress?
Symptoms of COPD typically begin in people aged over 40 who have smoked for 20 years or more. A 'smoker's cough' tends to develop at first. Once symptoms start, if you continue to smoke, there is usually a gradual decline over several years. You tend to become more and more breathless. In time your mobility and general quality of life may become poor due to increasing breathing difficulties.
Chest infections tend to become more frequent as time goes by. Flare-ups (exacerbations) of symptoms occur from time to time, typically during a chest infection. See the separate leaflet called Acute Exacerbations of COPD (COPD Flare-ups) for more information.
There are two ways of determining how severe an individual person's COPD is. One is by the spirometry test explained in the linked leaflet called Spirometry, which defines four stages. Another way is by using a breathlessness scale.
Medical Research Council (MRC) Breathlessness scale
Breathlessness can be graded as the following:
Grade 1: if you are not troubled by breathlessness except on strenuous exertion.
Grade 1: if you are not troubled by breathlessness except on strenuous exertion.
Grade 2: if you are short of breath when hurrying on level ground or walking up a slight incline.
Grade 2: if you are short of breath when hurrying on level ground or walking up a slight incline.
Grade 3: if you walk slower than others of your age because of breathlessness, or if you have to stop for breath when walking at your own pace.
Grade 3: if you walk slower than others of your age because of breathlessness, or if you have to stop for breath when walking at your own pace.
Grade 4: if you stop for breath after walking about 100 metres or if you have to stop after a few minutes of walking on level ground.
Grade 4: if you stop for breath after walking about 100 metres or if you have to stop after a few minutes of walking on level ground.
Grade 5: if you are too breathless to leave the house or if you are breathless on dressing or undressing.
Grade 5: if you are too breathless to leave the house or if you are breathless on dressing or undressing.
Some guidance uses a modified MRC scale - the descriptions are exactly the same, but they are graded from zero to four instead of from 1 to 5.
If the condition becomes severe then heart failure may develop. This is due to the reduced level of oxygen in the blood and to changes in the lung tissue which can cause increased pressure in the blood vessels in the lungs. This increase in pressure can put a strain on the heart muscle, leading to heart failure.
Heart failure can cause various symptoms including worsening breathlessness and fluid retention. (Note: heart failure does not mean the heart stops beating - that is called cardiac arrest. Heart failure occurs when the heart does not pump blood very well.)
Respiratory failure is the final stage of COPD. At this point the lungs are so damaged that the levels of oxygen in the blood are low. The waste product of breathing, called carbon dioxide (CO2), builds up in the bloodstream. People with end-stage COPD need palliative care to make them more comfortable and ease any symptoms.
Is COPD life-threatening?
COPD can be a life-threatening (fatal) disease in some cases. About 30,000 people die each year in the UK from the end stages of COPD. Many of these people have several years of ill health and poor quality of life before they die. In some cases people die of severe exacerbations due to severe chest infections. The life expectancy of a person with COPD is very variable and depends on various things such as:
How long you smoked for and how much you smoked

If you continue to smoke or if you continue to be exposed to the pollution or poisons which caused the condition.

Can COPD be cured?
COPD cannot be cured. However, if you stop smoking cigarettes, it may progress more slowly, or in some cases not get any worse. Some people live more or less normal lives with mild COPD for many years. Others are very disabled by their breathlessness.
Depression and/or anxiety commonly affect people with COPD, and can be treated if recognised.
COPD treatment
Stopping smoking is the most important treatment. No other treatment may be needed if the disease is in the early stage and symptoms are mild.
If symptoms become troublesome, one or more of the following treatments may be advised.
Note: treatments do not cure COPD. Treatments aim to ease symptoms. Some treatments may prevent some flare-ups (exacerbations) of symptoms.
As a general rule, a trial of 1-3 months of a treatment will give an idea of whether it helps or not. A treatment may be continued after a trial if it helps, but may be stopped if it does not improve symptoms.
It can be helpful to consider treatments for three separate problems.
Treatments for stable COPD.

Treatments for end-stage COPD.

These three treatment situations are discussed below.
Treatments for stable COPD
Inhalers
The main treatments are medications given in devices called inhalers. The medicine within the inhaler is in a powdered form which you breathe in (inhale). The medicines in standard inhalers reach the lungs better if used with a spacer device. Inhalers include one, two or even three types of medicines. They may include:
A bronchodilator agent - this is a medicine which opens up (dilates) the airways. Some work quickly but don't last very long; others are longer-acting.
A bronchodilator agent - this is a medicine which opens up (dilates) the airways. Some work quickly but don't last very long; others are longer-acting.
A steroid - these reduce the inflammation in the airway, thereby reducing the swelling. This in turn adds to the space available for air to pass. In recent years, treatment of COPD has moved away from steroid inhalers towards more use of long-acting bronchodilators.

See the separate leaflet called Inhalers for COPD (including Inhaled Steroids) for more details.
Bronchodilator tablets
These are tablets which open up the airways. They are explained in the separate leaflet called Oral Bronchodilators.
Mucolytic medicines
A mucolytic medicine such as carbocisteine and erdosteine makes the phlegm (sputum) less thick and sticky, and easier to cough up. This may also have a knock-on effect of making it harder for germs (bacteria) to infect the mucus and cause chest infections.
These medicines are explained in the separate leaflet called Mucolytics.
Non-medicine treatments
A programme called 'pulmonary rehabilitation' has been shown to be of benefit for people with moderate COPD. It is recommended for people who have Grade 3 (see explanation of the grades above) or worse, or for those who have landed up in hospital with an acute exacerbation of COPD. It is a series of sessions over a few weeks and includes:
Physical training (exercise classes) and advice about exercise.

Treatment of exacerbations of COPD
The most common trigger of a flare-up (exacerbation) of COPD is an infection - for example, a virus such as the common cold, or a bacterial or viral chest infection. Heavy air pollution can also trigger a flare-up. Treatment involves adding extra medicines temporarily to your usual treatment. This is usually steroid tablets with or without antibiotics. These medicines are usually taken until your symptoms settle down to what is normal for you.
If you have frequent flare-ups then your doctor may advise on a self-management plan. This is a written plan of action agreed by you and your doctor on what to do as soon as possible after a flare-up starts to develop. You might be given antibiotics and steroids to keep at home, so that they can be started quickly in the event of a flare-up.
If your symptoms are very severe, or if treatments for an exacerbation are not working well enough, you may need to be admitted to hospital.
For information on treatment in this situation, see the separate leaflet called Acute Exacerbations of COPD (COPD Flare-ups).
Treatment of end-stage COPD
Palliative care
Palliative care means care or treatment to keep a person as comfortable as possible - to reduce the severity of the disease, rather than to cure it. Mostly it is about helping you with your symptoms, to make them easier to bear. Palliative care is not quite the same as terminal (end of life care), when someone is dying and death is expected within a few days.
As COPD progresses, the condition becomes more severe. You might have more frequent exacerbations and/or admissions to hospital. These factors can give a clue as to how advanced the illness is. Palliative care is usually started in COPD when you are on the maximum medication and your condition is continuing to get worse (deteriorate). Sometimes in these situations you might choose to remain at home for any/all treatments, rather than having further hospital admissions, as things get worse.
Improving your quality of life in the end stages of COPD is very important. Palliative care can be given in a hospice, but is just as likely to be provided by your GP, district nurse or community palliative care team. The idea is that a multidisciplinary team, with different healthcare professionals, can anticipate any problems before they happen. The team can help you with access to medication and any equipment that might be needed.
Palliative care involves not just physical treatments. Psychological and spiritual well-being are important too. The aim is that both you and your family feel supported and that your care is planned.
Home oxygen
This may help some people with severe symptoms or end-stage COPD. It does not help in all cases. Unfortunately, just because you feel breathless with COPD it does not mean that oxygen will help you. Great care has to be taken with oxygen therapy. Too much oxygen can actually be harmful if you have COPD. To be considered for oxygen you would need to have very severe COPD, and be referred to a consultant (respiratory specialist) at a hospital for specialist assessment and advice.
Other medicines
Opioid medicines such as morphine and codeine may be prescribed to try to reduce your coughing, and to help with breathlessness. Hyoscine is a medication that can be given to try to dry up secretions from your lungs.
Anxiety is a common symptom when you are breathless. Morphine can help the feelings of anxiety. In some cases, other anti-anxiety medicines (such as diazepam) can be given. Depression and anxiety are common in patients with COPD, at all stages of the disease. You may already be prescribed medication for this.
Other treatments for COPD
Surgery
This is an option in a very small number of cases. Removing a section of lung that has become useless may improve symptoms. Sometimes large air-filled sacs (called bullae) develop in the lungs in people with COPD.
A single large bulla might be suitable for removal with an operation. This can improve symptoms in some people. Lung transplantation is being studied, but is not a realistic option in most cases.
What can I do to improve my own health with COPD?
Stop smoking
Stop smoking is the single most important piece of advice. If you stop smoking in the early stages of COPD it will make a huge difference. Damage already done to your airways cannot be reversed. So a person with COPD cannot get better, and cannot be completely cured.
However, stopping smoking can slow the progression of the disease, so that it does not get worse or does so more gradually. It is never too late to stop smoking, at any stage of the disease. Even if you have fairly advanced COPD, you are likely to get benefit and slow down further progression of the disease.
Your cough may get worse for a while when you give up smoking. This often happens as the lining of the airways 'comes back to life'. Resist the temptation to start smoking again to ease the cough. An increase in cough after you stop smoking usually settles in a few weeks.
The National Health Service (NHS) provides free help and advice for people having difficulty in stopping smoking. Medication, such as varenicline and bupropion, and nicotine replacement therapy (such as patches and chewing gum) can be prescribed, and counselling offered. You could see your GP or practice nurse for further advice, or visit the NHS Smokefree website.
Get immunised
Two immunisations are advised.
A yearly 'flu jab' each autumn protects against possible influenza and any chest infection that may develop due to this.

Try to do some regular exercise
Studies have shown that people with COPD who exercise regularly tend to improve their breathing, ease symptoms and have a better quality of life.
Any regular exercise or physical activity is good. However, ideally the activity that you do should make you at least a little out of breath, and be for at least 20-30 minutes, at least three to four times a week. If you are able, a daily brisk walk is a good start if you are not used to exercise. But, if possible, try to increase the level of activity over time.
If your ability to exercise is limited by your COPD (grade 3 or more) or if you have been hospitalised with a flare-up, you will need specialist advice to help you exercise safely. You may be referred for pulmonary rehabilitation or be under the care of a community respiratory team. You will be given exercises and advice to try to help you stay as fit as possible. This is important because, effectively, you may become disabled due to your breathlessness.
Try to lose weight if you are overweight
Obesity can make breathlessness worse. If you are overweight or obese it is harder to exercise, and exercise makes you more breathless. It becomes a bit of a vicious cycle. If you are obese the chest wall is made heavy by fat.
This means that you have to work much harder to breathe in and take a good breath, to inflate the lungs and expand the chest. A dietician may be able to give you advice on healthy eating and weight loss.
You may need nutritional supplements if you are underweight
You may also be referred to a dietician if you are underweight. A dietician will be able to advise you on your diet, and also on nutritional supplements to help keep your weight within a normal range.
If your weight is within the normal range (BMI 18-25), then a balanced, healthy, sensible normal diet is best.
Regular follow-up
If you have COPD, your GP surgery will probably call you yearly for a check-up or annual review. You can discuss your medication and the GP or nurse might assess your inhaler technique.
Regular review allows monitoring of the severity of your COPD, and gives an opportunity for health promotion such as help with stopping smoking or weight control. Reviews should happen more often:
If you have frequent flare-ups (exacerbations), or complications.
If you have frequent flare-ups (exacerbations), or complications.
If you have very severe COPD.
If you have very severe COPD.
If you have recently been discharged from hospital.
If you have recently been discharged from hospital.
COPD and flying
If you have COPD and plan to fly then you should discuss this with the airline. Some airlines may request a fitness to fly assessment. Your GP is unlikely to be trained or insured to comment on your fitness to fly. They can provide (for a fee) a factual letter outlining how severe your COPD is, but if you want an assessment of your fitness to fly then you would need to see a doctor trained in travel medicine. This can take some time and is usually not available on the NHS, so think about it well in advance of any plans to travel.
If you are able to walk for 50 metres at a normal pace, or climb one flight of stairs, without feeling breathless, it is likely that you will not be affected in an aeroplane. If this is not the case, or if there are abnormalities in your lungs on examination, you will probably need assessment from your specialist. If you use oxygen (long-term oxygen therapy - LTOT), you will need to inform the airline, and discuss this further with your specialist.
When travelling by air you should keep your medicines, especially your inhalers, in your hand luggage. It is possible to use your own oxygen in-flight but individual circumstances may differ. Some people with COPD are more likely to need in-flight oxygen. Some people are more at risk of a punctured lung (pneumothorax) at altitude, despite the fact that the aircraft cabin is pressurised.
