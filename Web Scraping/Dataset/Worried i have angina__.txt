evening all, im convinced i have angina i wondered if anyone who has it or knows about it could help me, im 39, im fairly fit i eat mostly healthy, i dont smoke. ive done 10 half marathons and a full marathon in last 10 years recenlty ive been having what ive been told is anxiety im constanlty obessed with my heart i had a panic attack last summer and had lots of tests done echo cardiagram mutliple ecgs and a 5 day holter all came back fine but the only test i didnt have was for angina. i can do an intensive 10 min workout and do a 2 mile run and sprint uphill at the end and i feel ok. would i be able to do all this if i had angina. my dad died at 59 of a heart attack but he was very unfit and smoked alot. oh by the way my cholesterol is 5.1 overall. any help or advise is appreciated thanks guys.

well the family history should buy you an angiogram bud. i know you’re in good shape but athletes can have really bad heart disease while overweight “unhealthy” people can have clean arteries. push for further testing.
