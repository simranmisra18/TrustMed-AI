A while ago I slept with a girl and shortly after I got a large-ish non painful firm sore on my shaft, which went away. Recently I’ve had what looks like really severe chafing between my thighs, blisters, rash, and a raw-smelling slime (but no sores). Just today after some time with myself, I noticed four small bruises that almost looked like hairs under the skin, then several bumps with black centres. It doesn’t itch but it is sensitive. Do I have herpes??
