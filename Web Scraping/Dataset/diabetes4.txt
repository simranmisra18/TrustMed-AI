Diabetes is a number of diseases that involve problems with the hormone insulin. There is no cure for diabetes. There are three major types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. Diabetes insipidus causes you to have an almost unquenchable thirst and your body to make a lot of urine. Gestational DI, or gestagenic diabetes insipidus, is a rare disorder that happens in pregnancy, usually in the third trimester. The warning signs of diabetes can be so mild that you don't notice them. That's especially true of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes diagnostic tests include a fasting plasma glucose test, oral glucose tolerance test, or random plasma glucose test. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) shows how well your body handles sugar from foods. The hemoglobin A1c test is an important blood test that shows how well your diabetes is being controlled. You cannot treat diabetes on your own. Your doctor will help you make a diabetes treatment plan that is right for you. Different doctors can help you manage different aspects of your diabetes. Find out who you need on your team. Many forms of insulin treat diabetes, including rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting, long-acting, and pre-mixed. Toujeo is an injectable insulin medication for the treatment of diabetes (type 1 or type 2) in people who are 6 years old and older. It is a long-acting form of insulin, which allows it to last for a long time in the body to help control blood sugars. Blood sugar control is at the center of any diabetes treatment plan. High blood sugar, or hyperglycemia, is a major concern. People with diabetes get hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) when their bodies don't have enough sugar to use as fuel. Continuous glucose monitors are FDA-approved systems that track your blood sugar levels day and night. Most people with diabetes need to check their glucose levels regularly. The results help you and your doctor manage those levels. Nerve pain caused by diabetes, known as diabetic peripheral neuropathy, can be severe, constant, and hard to treat. Skin conditions related to diabetes are common. Most can be successfully treated before they turn into a serious problem. Diabetic nephropathy -- kidney disease that results from diabetes -- is the No. 1 cause of kidney failure. Most infections in people with diabetes can be treated. But you have to be able to spot the symptoms. Learn what to look for. Type 2 diabetes is a lifelong disease that keeps your body from using insulin the way it should. Prediabetes is when your blood sugar level is higher than it should be but not enough for your doctor to diagnose diabetes. Insulin resistance is when cells in your muscles, fat, and liver donât respond well to insulin. You might not know that you have type 2 diabetes until it affects your health.Symptoms can come on slowly. Type 1 diabetes is a condition in which your immune system destroys insulin-making cells in your pancreas. Know the symptoms of type 1 diabetes so you can help keep your child healthy. For those with diabetes, an insulin shot delivers medicine into the subcutaneous tissue. It's important to eat a healthy diet when you have type 1 diabetes. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy tasty food. Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that you get only when you're pregnant. Although some things mean you're more likely to get gestational diabetes, you can steps to lower your risk. All pregnant women should be screened for gestational diabetes during their pregnancy. If you have gestational diabetes, you'll need to get your blood sugar under control to protect your health and your baby's. Whether you're newly diagnosed with diabetic macular edema or already in treatment, learn how to make the most of your doctor appointment. If youâve been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, itâs important to have a care team that respects and understands you. Learn more. Limit carbs or sugar? Where should you test your blood glucose?

Type 1 diabetes is a condition in which your immune system destroys insulin-making cells (beta cells) in your pancreas. That means your body can't make enough insulin or any at all. Insulin is a hormone that helps move glucose (sugar) from your blood and into your cells so it can be used for energy. Because type 1 diabetes is often diagnosed in kids and young adults, it used to be called juvenile diabetes. In the past, it was also called insulin-dependent diabetes. Are you born with type 1 diabetes? You can get it at any age. In fact, half of all people now diagnosed with type 1 diabetes are adults. Type 1 diabetes vs. secondary diabetes A condition called secondary diabetes is like type 1, but your insulin-making cells are wiped out by another health condition or an injury to your pancreas, rather than by your immune system. Type 1 diabetes vs. type 2diabetes If you have type 1, your body doesn't make enough insulin. Withtype 2 diabetes, your body can make insulin but can't use it well. The cells in your muscles, fat, and liver build up what's called insulin resistance. With type 1 diabetes, you need to use man-made insulin every day so your body can function. But not everyone with type 2 diabetes needs it. Other medications can help you manage the condition. No matter which type of diabetes you have, you'll need to keep a close eye on your daily habits, such as what you eat and how much activity you get to stay healthy. Keeping a close eye on your blood sugar is a key part of managing diabetes. A continuous glucose monitor lets you check your levels in real time. (Photo Credit: Moment/Getty Images) Symptoms can come on very quickly. They include: Late-onset type 1diabetes symptoms More research is being done on what's calledLatent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults(LADA). Some people refer to this as "Diabetes 1.5" or "Diabetes 1 1/2" because it overlaps with parts of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. LADA symptomscan come on very slowly, making it tricky to diagnose. So does the fact that people who have it are usually at a healthy weight, and often between the ages of 30 and 50 years. Your child is at higher risk of type 1 diabetes if: Type 1 diabetes symptoms in children The signs are the same as for adults, but you may also notice: In some babies or kids, type 1 diabetes can also look like the flu. If you notice any of these symptoms, take your child to the doctor. Experts aren't sure what causes your pancreas to stop making insulin for your body. Your genes and immune system both appear to play big roles. Is type 1 diabetes genetic? To an extent, yes. Once you inherit genes that put you at risk for type 1, an environmental trigger such as an infection, virus, orautoimmune disorder, seems necessary to "switch" them on. When scientists look atthe blood of people with type 1, they can see special proteins that show their immune system is going after their pancreas. Only about 5%-10% of people with diabetes have type 1. The risk factors for it aren't as clear as they are for type 2 diabetes.Â So far, experts only know that youâre more likely to have it if you: If your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, theyâll check your blood sugar levels. This can be done in a few different ways. A1c test.Also called a glycated hemoglobin test, it can figure out your average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months with one small blood sample. It does that by counting the number of hemoglobin (red blood) cells that are sticky with glucose.Â If your A1c result is 6.5% or higher, you'll retake the test. If it's the same number or higher, you likely have diabetes. This test may not give you a correct result if you have any of the following: If you're of African, Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian descent, you could also have a different type of hemoglobin (called a hemoglobin variant) that could skew your A1c result. Let your doctor know if any of these apply to you. If so, they can test your blood sugar in different ways, such asÂ Fasting blood sugar test.In this test, your blood's taken after you haven't eaten overnight. A result of 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or higher on two separate tests signals diabetes. Random blood sugar test.Your blood glucose can also be checked at a random time. Whether or not you've recently eaten, a result of 200 mg/dL or higher means diabetes. Type 1 diabetes test The above tests can show whether you have diabetes, but they can't tell you which type. To find out whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, your doctor will need to look for: Autoantibodies.These are the proteins in your immune system that attack healthy cells, such as beta cells in your pancreas that make insulin. If you have type 1 diabetes, they'll show up in a blood sample. Ketones. When you have type 1, your body relies on acids called ketones for fuel because it doesn't have enough glucose to use. A urine (pee) test can detect them. Across the U.S., type 1 diabetes is on the rise. Hispanic and Black communities are affected more than others. For instance, studies show that if you have brown or black skin, controlling your blood glucose once you're diagnosed is more of a challenge. Black children with type 1 diabetes are also at higher risk ofdepression, diabetes complications, and hospital stays. Structural racism plays a big part in explaining this inequality. Many long-standing laws and policies discriminate against people of color. So do systems such as health care. You can be diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and live a long, healthy life. Keeping a close eye on your blood sugar levels will be key. Your doctor will give you a target range, and making healthy choices daily will help you stay within that range. It's also important to know the symptoms of very high or low blood sugar, and how to treat them. Type 1 diabetes medications You'll also need to use insulin every day. When your doctor talks about insulin, theyâll mention three main things: Several types of insulin are available. Ways to take insulin Insulin doesn't come in pill form, so you'll have to rely on other ways to get it into your body: Insulin injections.Most insulin shots come in a small glass bottle called a vial. You draw it out with a syringe that has a needle on the end and give yourself the shot. Some kinds come in a prefilled pen. Inhaled insulin.Your doctor may prescribe a rapid-acting insulin that you breathe into your mouth through a small device. It's not healthy to use this type if you smoke or have lung issues such as asthma. Insulin pump.This device, which you wear, sends small bursts of insulin into your body throughout the day. It does this through a small tube just under your skin. Your doctor will help you pick the type of insulin and delivery method thatâs best for you. Continuous glucose monitoring Checking your blood sugar throughout the day will help make sure it stays within your target range. Pricking your finger and testing a blood sample with a blood glucose meter is one way to check. Many people also choose to wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). Using a sensor just under your skin, this device can check your glucose every few minutes. Most models will alert you if it goes too high or too low, so you can treat it right away. Other type 1 diabetes medications Based on your health, your doctor could also prescribe: To feel your best, try to: Get enough sleep. It can improve your blood sugar as well as your outlook. If you can, aim for at least 7 hours each night. Babies, kids, and teens will need even more. Manage your stress. It's really common to feel angry or overwhelmed that you have type 1. Find healthy ways to reduce your stress. Talk to trusted friends and family members or ask your doctor to refer you to a counselor or therapist. Quit smoking.Vaping and chewing tobacco are habits to stop, too. All these things narrow yourblood vesselsand put you at risk for other health issues. Talk to your doctor if you're not sure how to quit. Visit your doctor regularly. Regular medical, dental, and eye exams can help you prevent issues, or treat them as soon as they're found. Find ways to be active.Try to find a physical activity you enjoy. Even taking care of your garden counts. Talk to your doctor about how to balance your insulin dose and the food you eat with any activity you do. Type 1 diabetes diet Once you know how carbs, fats, and protein affect your blood sugar, you can build a healthy eating plan that helps keep your levels where they should be. Generally speaking, you'll focus on eating lots of nutrient-rich vegetables, fruits, and whole grains while cutting back on refined carbohydrates, such as white bread or pasta, which quickly raise your blood sugar. No foods is off-limits, but you will need to limit some or enjoy smaller portions than you used to. A diabetes educator or registered dietitian can help you learn to count carbohydrates at each meal and snack. If you're not sure how to connect with these experts, ask your doctor. If your blood sugar isn't well-managed, it can lead to other health issues, including: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).If your body can't get enough glucose for fuel, it breaks down fat cells instead. This creates chemicals called ketones. Your liver releases the sugar it stores to help out. But your body canât use it without insulin, so it builds up in your blood, along with the acidic ketones. This mix of extra glucose, dehydration, and acid buildup is known as ketoacidosis and can be life-threatening if not treated right away. Heart disease.Diabetes can put you at higher risk ofblood clots, high blood pressure, and cholesterol. These can lead to chest pain, heart attack, stroke, or heart failure. Skin conditions.You're more likely to get blisters and rashes, as well as bacterial or fungal infections. Gum disease.A dry mouth, increased plaque, and poor blood flow can all cause mouth issues. Pregnancy complications.Type 1 diabetes raises your risk of early delivery, birth defects, stillbirth, andpreeclampsia. Retinopathy.This eye issue happens in about 80% of adults who have had type 1 diabetes for more than 15 years. To prevent it and to keep your eyesight,you'll need to control your blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Kidney damage.About 20%-30% of people with type 1 diabetes get a condition called nephropathy. The chance of getting it goes up over time. Itâs most likely to show up 15-25 years after the onset of diabetes. It can lead to other serious problems such as kidney failure and heart disease. Poor blood flow and nerve damage.Damaged nerves and hardened arteries lead to a loss of feeling in, and a lack of blood supply to, your feet. This raises your chances of injury and makes it harder for open sores and wounds to heal. When that happens, you could lose a limb. Nerve damage can also cause digestive problems such as nausea, vomiting, anddiarrhea. Exciting new treatments in the works include: Glucose monitoring without needle sticks.This is proving to be a challenge for scientists. Continuous ketone monitor (CKM). Like a CGM, a wearable device would monitor the fluid between your cells. Longer-acting insulin. For instance, one type would keep your blood glucose steady for a week. Immunotherapy.Some experts are looking for ways to "switch off" your immune system so it stops attacking the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. "New" beta cells.One early-stage Australian study was able to get pancreatic stem cells to make insulin. If testing pans out, your remaining pancreas cells may be treated one day to start makinginsulinagain. Keep up with new research on type 1 diabetes through a trusted organization such as the CDC or the American Diabetes Association. Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong condition. A diagnosis may feel overwhelming, but you can learn to manage your blood sugar. Making healthy choices every day will be key.

Type 2 diabetes is a lifelong disease that keeps your body from using insulin the way it should. People who are middle-aged or older are most likely to get this kind of diabetes. It used to be called adult-onset diabetes or diabetes mellitus. But type 2 diabetes also affects kids andteens, mainly because ofchildhood obesity. Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes. About 1 in 10 people in the U.S. have type 2. Nearly 1 in 3 have prediabetes, meaning their blood sugar (or blood glucose) is high but not high enough to be diabetes yet. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes can be so mild that you don't notice them. About 9 million people have it and don't know it. Symptoms include: If you have dark rashes around your neck or armpits, see your doctor. These are called acanthosis nigricans, and they can be signs that your body is becoming resistant to insulin. Learn more about type 2 diabetes symptoms. There are three main types of diabetes: Type 2 diabetes About 90%-95% of all people with diabetes have this type. With type 2, your pancreas makes someinsulinâ the hormone that helps your cells turn glucose (a type of sugar) from the food you eat into energy. In some people, your cells don't respond to this hormone as they should (a condition called insulin resistance). Type 1 diabetes In type 1, your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin, leading to high blood sugar. Doctors aren't sure why this happens. Type 1 isn't related to weight or lifestyle habits. It used to be called insulin-dependent or childhood diabetes.Â Gestational diabetes You only get this type of diabetes when you're pregnant. It happens because hormonal changes andweight gainduring pregnancy can lead toinsulin resistance. It usually goes away after you have your baby. Usually, a combination of things causes type 2 diabetes. They might include: Genes.Scientists have found different bits of DNA that affect how your body makes insulin. Weight.Having extra weight or obesity can cause insulin resistance. Metabolic syndrome.People with insulin resistance often have a group of conditions including high blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol and triglycerides. Too much glucose from your liver.When your blood sugar is low, your liver makes and sends out glucose. After you eat, your blood sugar goes up, and your liver usually slows down and stores its glucose for later. But some people's livers don't. They keep making sugar. Bad communication between cells.Sometimes, cells send the wrong signals or don't pick up messages correctly. When these problems affect how your cells make and use insulin or glucose, this can lead to diabetes. Broken beta cells.If the cells that make insulin send it out at the wrong time, your blood sugar gets thrown off.High blood sugarcan damage these cells, too. Certain things make it more likely that youâll get type 2 diabetes. The more of these factors apply to you, the higher your chances of getting it. It's good to be aware of what can cause type 2 diabetes, such as: Risk factors related to your medical history and health include: Other things that raise yourrisk of diabetesare related to your daily habits and lifestyle. These are the ones you can change: Type 2 diabetes epidemiology Some 462 million people worldwide, or about 6.3% of the population, have type 2 diabetes. It's the ninth leading cause of death, responsible for more than 1 million deaths each year. Cases of type 2 diabetes are increasing faster in developed countries such as the U.S. and Western Europe. Scientists say type 2 diabetes affects men and women at about the same rate. It's more common in people in middle age and older, affecting: It's also more common in people of color, including those whose heritage is: Your doctor can test your blood for signs of type 2 diabetes. Usually, theyâll test you on 2 different days to confirm the diagnosis. But if yourblood glucoseis very high or you have many symptoms, one test may be all you need. Blood tests for type 2 diabetes include: A1c.It's an average percentage of your blood glucose over the past 2 or 3 months. Fasting plasma glucose.This is also known as a fasting blood sugar test. It measures your blood sugar on an empty stomach. You won't be able to eat or drink anything except water for 8 hours before the test. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).This checks your blood glucose before and 2 hours after you drink something sweet to see how your body handles the sugar. Learn more about how type 2 diabetes is diagnosed.Â Researchers have defined four stages of type 2 diabetes: Insulin resistance In this stage, your body usually makes enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels in the normal range. But if your cells "resist" the insulin (don't use it correctly), your body will make more insulin to help the glucose get into them. Insulin resistance can be temporary, but it can also last. There's no test to detect insulin resistance, so it can be hard to diagnose. Prediabetes Eventually, insulin resistance causes glucose to build up in your blood. You have prediabetes when your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered diabetes. An A1c between 5.7% and 6.4% means you haveprediabetes. You may not have any symptoms, but prediabetes ups your risk for heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.Â Type 2 diabetes If your A1c is 6.5% or higher, you have diabetes. You may have symptoms such as increased thirst, blurred vision, and numbness in feet or hands. Or you may not have any symptoms at all.Â Type 2 diabetes with vascular complications At this stage, your diabetes has led to vascular (blood vessel) problems. You may have damage to vessels in your eyes (retinopathy), kidneys (nephropathy), and certain nerves (neuropathy). You might also develop heart disease, stroke, or circulation issues. Managing type 2 diabetes includes a mix of lifestyle changes and medication. Lifestyle changes You may be able to reach your target blood sugar levels with diet and exercise alone. Weight loss.Dropping extra pounds can help. While losing 5% of your body weight is good, losing at least 7% and keeping it off seems to be ideal. That means someone who weighs 180 pounds can change their blood sugar levels by losing around 13 pounds. Weight loss can seem overwhelming, but portion control and eating healthy foods are a good place to start. Healthy eating.Thereâs no specific diet for type 2 diabetes. A registered dietitian can teach you about carbs and help you make a meal plan you can stick with. Focus on: Exercise.Try to get 30-60 minutes of physical activity every day. You can walk, bike, swim, or do anything else that ups your heart rate. Pair that with strength training, such as yoga or weightlifting. If you take a medication that lowers your blood sugar, you might need a snack before a workout. Watch your blood sugar levels.Depending on your treatment, especially if youâre on insulin, your doctor will tell you if you need to test your blood sugar levels and how often to do it. Type 2 diabetes medication If lifestyle changes donât get you to your target blood sugar levels, you may need medication. Some of the most common for type 2 diabetes include: Metformin(Fortamet, Glucophage, Glumetza, Riomet). This is usually the first medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. It lowers the amount of glucose your liver makes and helps your body respond better to the insulin it does make. Sulfonylureas.This group of drugs helps your body make more insulin. They include glimepiride (Amaryl), glipizide (Glucotrol), and glyburide (DiaBeta, Micronase). Meglitinides.They help your body make more insulin and work faster than sulfonylureas. You might take nateglinide (Starlix) or repaglinide (Prandin). Thiazolidinediones.Like metformin, they make you more sensitive to insulin. You could get pioglitazone (Actos) or rosiglitazone (Avandia). But they also raise your risk of heart problems, so they arenât usually a first choice for treatment. DPP-4 inhibitors.These medications â linagliptin (Tradjenta), saxagliptin (Onglyza), and sitagliptin (Januvia) â help lower your blood sugar levels, but they can also cause joint pain and could inflame your pancreas. They work by blocking DPP-4, which is an enzyme that affects the hormone incretin. GLP-1 receptor agonists.You take these medications through a needle to slow digestion and lower blood sugar levels. Some of the most common ones are exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon), liraglutide (Victoza), and semaglutide (Ozempic). Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.These medications miglitol (Glyset) and acarbose (Precose) slow your body's digestion of sugar. Let your doctor know if you have kidney, liver, or heart issues or if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. These medicines are unlikely to cause low blood pressure and weight gain; however, side effects include gastrointestinal issues and abnormal liver readings. Biguanides.This medication, metformin (Fortamet, Glucophage, Glumetza, and Riomet), lowers blood sugar levels. Typical side effects include gastrointestinal issues, nausea or vomiting, weakness, and headache. You should avoid drinking large amounts of alcohol when taking this drug because it may trigger a rare side effect, a buildup of acid in your blood called lactic acidosis. SGLT2 inhibitors.These help your kidneys filter out more glucose. You might getbexagliflozin (Brenzavvy),canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), or empagliflozin (Jardiance). Empagliflozin has also proven effective in reducingÂ the risk of hospitalization or death from heart failure. GIP and GLP-1Â receptor agonist.Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) is the first in this class andÂ activates both the GLP-1 and GIP receptors, which leads to improved blood sugar control. Insulin.You might take long-lasting shots at night, such as insulin detemir (Levemir) or insulin glargine (Lantus). Even if you change your lifestyle and take your medicine as directed, your blood sugar may still get worse over time. That doesnât mean youâve done something wrong. Diabetes is progressive, and many people eventually need more than one drug. When you take more than one drug to control your type 2 diabetes, thatâs called combination therapy. You and your doctor should work together to find the best mix for you.Â Some drugs control blood sugar spikes (also called hyperglycemia) that come right after meals, for instance. Others are more effective at stopping drops in blood sugar (hypoglycemia) between meals. Some may help with weight loss or cholesterol, as well as your diabetes. You and your doctor should talk about any possible side effects. Cost may be an issue as well. If you take medication for something else, that will need to be factored into any decision. Youâll need to see your doctor more often when you start taking a new combination of drugs. You might find that adding a second drug doesnât bring your blood sugar under control. Or the combination of two drugs might work only for a short time. If that happens, your doctor might consider a third non-insulin drug, or you may start insulin therapy. SurgeriesÂ for type 2 diabetes Weight loss surgery can effectively treat type 2 diabetes by helping youlose weight. These procedures limit how much food you can eat or how many nutrients your body can take in. You'll need to commit to long-term healthy lifestyle changes to get the full benefits of this type of surgery.Â Several types are available. Talk to your doctor about whether weight loss surgery is right for you. Alternative treatments for type 2 diabetes There's not much scientific evidence that any alternative treatment can help you manage your blood sugar. Research into dietary supplements has found that: Some research has found that mind-body practices such as yoga and meditation might help with blood sugar control when used along withdiabetes drugs.That may be because of their stress-relief benefits. Always talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatment. These treatments can't replace diabetes medications. Some populations are more likely to get type 2 diabetes. Latino (12%), Black (12%), and Asian (10%) people have higher rates of diabetes than white people (7%). American Indians get it at about twice the rate as white people (14.5%). Members of racial and ethnic minority groups with type 2 are also likely to have worse health outcomes. Yet research shows that members of minority groups are less likely to use newer diabetes medications, regardless of their income or whether they havehealth insurance. And no matter what their ethnicity, people with lower incomes were less likely to take these medications. Across all races and ethnicities with diabetes, about 15% live in poverty, 19% have difficulties accessing food, and 51% have low-quality diets. Also, Black, Latino, and Native American people are less likely to be included in clinical studies to try new diabetes drugs. Over time, high blood sugar can damage and cause problems with your: Heart and blood vessels.If you have high blood sugar, youâre up to twice as likely to get heart disease or have a stroke, and at a younger age compared to those with normal sugar. Youâre also at high risk of blocked blood vessels (atherosclerosis) and chest pain (angina). Kidneys.If your kidneys are damaged or you have kidney failure, you could need dialysis or a kidney replacement. Eyes.High blood sugar can damage the tiny blood vessels in the backs of your eyes. If left untreated, it can cause blindness. Nerves.This can lead to trouble with digestion, loss of sensation in your feet, and sexual problems. Skin.Your blood doesnât circulate as well, so wounds heal slower and can become infected. Pregnancy.Parents with diabetes are more likely to have a miscarriage, a stillbirth, or a baby with a birth defect. Sleep.You might develop sleep apnea, a condition in which your breathing stops and starts while you sleep. Hearing.Youâre more likely to have hearing problems, but itâs not clear why. Brain.High blood sugar can damage your brain and might put you at a higher risk of Alzheimerâs disease. Depression.People with the disease are twice as likely to get depressed as people who donât have it. The best way to avoid these complications is to manage your type 2 diabetes well. To do that: Managing diabetes is complicated. You'll need to adopt healthy lifestyle habits, check your blood sugar regularly, and keep up with doctor visits and treatments. But your efforts can have a big impact on your health and your quality of life. Type 2 diabetes diet Adietitiancan help you create a personalized meal plan that takes your needs and preferences into account. A healthy diabetes diet should focus on: Type 2 diabetes costs On average,people diagnosed with diabetes have medical expenses that are 2.6 times higher than those without the disease. Your annual medical expenses can average$19,736 a year,$12,022 of which is directly due to diabetes.Â These expenses include doctor visits, hospitalizations, and medication. You may have other costs as well, such as lost time and less productivity at work. Managing type 2 diabetes Managing your type 2 diabetes well helps you avoid complications and feel your best. Along with a healthy diet, regular exercise, and medication as prescribed: Type 2 diabetes and mental health A long-term health condition can take a toll on your mental health. Peoplewith diabetes are two to three times as likely to havedepressionand 20% more likely to have anxiety than those without the condition. Many don't get diagnosed or treated, even though therapy, medication, or a combination can work very well. Many people with diabetes sometimes get overwhelmed by the pressures of trying to manage the condition. This is called diabetes distress, and it can lead to you to neglect your health. A support group or counseling could help you overcome it. If you're worried about your emotional health, ask your doctor to recommend a mental health professional. The long-term outlook for people with type 2 varies depending on how effectively they manage the condition. At age 50, the average life expectancy (LE) for those with type 2 is 6 years shorter than those without the condition. But proper care and treatment can help you improve those odds.Â Can type 2 diabetes be cured? There's no cure for type 2. You may be able to get your blood sugar under control by losing weight and making healthy lifestyle changes and might even be able to stop taking diabetes medications. But this isn't the case for everyone.Â What to expect with type 2 diabetes Type 2 is a serious condition that demands lifelong management. Over the long term, high blood sugar can lead to heart, vision, and kidney problems. But you can take steps to avoid these complications and extend your life. Several studies show that: All these things also reduce your risk of developing other diseases. Adopting a healthy lifestyle can help you lower your risk of diabetes: Type 2 diabetes is a serious condition that requires lifelong management. Weight loss, a healthy lifestyle, and medications, if needed, can help you keep it under control. All can help you live a longer, healthier life. Can you reverse type 2 diabetes? Type 2 diabetes is not curable, but the glucose levels of some people can return to normal or prediabetes levels in what is called complete and partial remission. People are able to accomplish this mainly by losing weight. Sometimes, the beta cells, which make insulin, stop working, in a condition known as glucose toxicity. You might also go into remission when your glucose levels decrease and your beta cells start to produce insulin again. What lifestyle changes can help prevent or manage type 2 diabetes? If you have an increased risk for diabetes, making lifestyle changes can help prevent the disease. Some things you can do: Is type 2 diabetes an autoimmune disease? There is a type of diabetes that develops in adulthood called latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). In people with LADA, the pancreas stops making insulin, similar to type 1 diabetes but at a slower rate. In LADA, an autoimmune response damages pancreatic cells and causes them to stop working.Â What role does diet play in the management of type 2 diabetes? Diet plays a tremendous role in managing your diabetes. A healthy diet can help manage your blood sugar levels as well as lower cholesterol levels and blood pressure. It's important to know what carbohydrates may be "good" or "bad" for your diabetes. You should greatly reduce unhealthy refined carbohydrates and foods high in added sugar, salt, and fats. A diet rich in whole grains, fiber, vegetables, lean proteins, legumes, and some fruits is a healthy one if you have diabetes. How does exercise impact type 2 diabetes management? As with a healthy diet, exercise is important in managing your diabetes. Exercise is key in losing and managing weight and lowering cholesterol and blood pressure. Studies have found that exercise can lower A1c levels by nearly 1%, even in people who lost no weight, regardless of the type of exercise. Other findings: walking at least 2 hours weekly lowered the risk of death from heart disease, particularly in women. Also, combining aerobic exercise and resistance training helps lower insulin resistance in adults who previously didn't exercise at all.

Gestational diabetesÂ is a condition in which yourÂblood sugar levelsÂ become high duringÂ pregnancy. It affects pregnant people who have never been diagnosed withÂ diabetes. There are two classes of gestational diabetes. Those with class A1 can manage it throughÂ diet and exercise. Those who have class A2 need to takeÂ insulinÂ or otherÂ medications. Gestational diabetes goes away after you give birth. But it can affect yourÂ babyâs health, and it raises your odds of gettingÂtype 2 diabetesÂ later in life. You can take steps so you and your baby stay healthy. How common is gestational diabetes? Gestational diabetes affects up to 10% of pregnancies in the U.S. each year. If you have gestational diabetes, you usually donât have symptoms or might blame them onpregnancy. Most find out that they have it during a routine screening.You may notice that: The American Diabetes Association recommends these targets for pregnant women who test their blood sugar: When you eat, yourÂ pancreasÂ releases insulin, a hormone that helps move a sugar called glucose from your blood to your cells, which use it for energy. During pregnancy, yourÂ placentaÂ makes hormones that cause glucose to build up in yourÂ blood. Usually, yourÂ pancreasÂ can send out enough insulin to handle it. But if your body canât make enough insulin or stops using insulin as it should, yourblood sugar levelsrise, and you get gestational diabetes. Youâre more likely to get gestational diabetes if you: Gestational diabetes usually happens in the second half of pregnancy. When do they test for gestational diabetes? Your doctor will check for it between weeks 24 and 28, or sooner if you're at high risk. Gestational diabetes test Your doctor will give you aglucose tolerance test. For the test, youâll drink 50 grams of glucose in a sweet drink, which will raise yourÂ blood sugar. An hour later, youâll take a blood glucose test to see how your body handled all that sugar. If the results show that your blood sugar is higher than a certain level, youâll need a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test. For this test, youâll take a blood glucose test after you have fasted for at least 8 hours (your doctorâs office will tell you exactly how long to fast for) and then drink a beverage containing 100 grams of glucose. After that, youâll take a blood glucose test every hour for the next 3 hours. Your doctor can also test you by having you fast for at least 8 hours, take a blood glucose test, drink a drink containing 75 grams of glucose, and then take ablood glucose testonce an hour for the next 2 hours. Gestational diabetes range A high blood sugar level is above 130-140 mg/dL (7.2-7.7 mmol/L). If it's higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), then it's likely that you have gestational diabetes. If youâre at high risk but your test results are normal, your doctor might test you again later in your pregnancy to make sure you still donât have it. If you have gestational diabetes, youâll need treatment as soon as possible to keep yourself and your baby healthy during your pregnancy and delivery. Your doctor will ask you to: Your doctor will keep track of yourÂ weightÂ and your babyâs development. They might give you insulin or another medicine to keep your blood sugar under control. If you have gestational diabetes, you have a higher chance of complications. They include: Needing a C-section.Since your baby might be larger than normal, you may need a C-section, or surgery to deliver your baby through your belly. Hypoglycemia.Also called low blood sugar, this condition can happen when you take insulin or other medicine to control your diabetes. Both you and your baby can gethypoglycemia. Preeclampsia.If you have high blood pressure, protein in your pee, and constant swelling in your fingers and toes, it could indicate preeclampsia. It's a serious condition requiring close tracking by a doctor. Preeclampsia can be dangerous for both you and your unborn child. It can lead to your baby being born early and raise your chances of seizures or stroke during labor. If you have diabetes, you're more prone to high blood pressure than those without diabetes. Take these simple steps to stay well: Eat a healthy, low-sugar diet.Â Talk to your doctor to be sure youâre getting the nutrition you need. Follow a meal plan made for someone withdiabetes: Gestational diabetes breakfast ideas Here are a few breakfast ideas if you have gestational diabetes: Gestational diabetes snacks For a snack, you can try: Get the right prenatal care:Your doctor can check to see if you havegestational diabetesand offer advice on food, activity, and weight loss. They can also point you to other health professionals, such asnutritionists, that can help.If you haveÂ morning sickness, eat small snacks.Â Nibble on crackers,Â cereal, or pretzels before you get out of bed. As you go through your day, have small meals often and avoid fatty, fried, and greasy foods. If you take insulin, make sure you've got a plan to deal withÂ low blood sugar.Â Throwing up can lower your glucose level. Talk to your doctor if you're not sure what to do. Exercise throughout your pregnancy.Â You can exercise when you have gestational diabetes as long as your doctor says itâs OK. Being active is a good way to help manage your blood sugar. Staying fit during pregnancy is also good for your posture and can curb some common problems, such as backaches andÂ fatigue. You can lower your chancesÂ before you get pregnantÂ by: Your baby will probably be healthy if you and your doctor manage yourblood sugarwhile you have gestational diabetes. Right after you give birth, doctors will check your newborn's blood sugar level. If itâs low, your baby may need to get glucose through an IV until it gets back to normal. Gestational diabetes raises the chance that your baby will be larger than normal. It's also linked toÂ jaundice, in which theÂ skinÂ looks yellowish.Jaundicegenerally fades quickly with treatment. Although your child will be more likely than other kids to getÂ type 2 diabetesÂ later on, a healthy lifestyle (including a good diet and lots of physical activity) can cut that risk. Average week of delivery with gestational diabetes Having gestational diabetes means your doctor may induce labor early, at 37-38 weeks. A full-term pregnancy starts at 39 weeks. An earlier labor lowers the chances of health problems for you and your baby. Because you had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of havingÂtype 2 diabetes. But it's not certain that it will happen, and you can take action to prevent that. Your blood sugar levels will likely return to normal about 6 weeks afterÂ childbirth. (Your doctor will check on that.) If it does, you should get follow-up tests at least every 3 years; your doctor may recommend yearly testing. To lower your odds: If you plan to have another baby, keep in mind that you are more likely to get gestational diabetes again. Ask your doctor if any lifestyle changes would help you avoid that. Gestational diabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels rise during pregnancy. It affects up to 10% of pregnancies in the U.S. It typically appears in the second half of pregnancy and often goes unnoticed, with symptoms such as more thirst, hunger, and peeing. You have a higher chance of getting it if you're overweight before pregnancy, have a family history of diabetes, and belong to certain ethnic backgrounds. Treatment focuses on tracking your blood sugar levels, adopting a healthy diet, and staying active. Although gestational diabetes usually goes away after childbirth, it can impact your baby's health and raise your chances of having type 2 diabetes later in life.

Diabetes is a disease that involves problems with the way your body makes or manages the hormone insulin. It's also known as diabetes mellitus. Normally, your pancreas (an organ behind the stomach) releases insulin to help your body store and use the sugar and fat from the food you eat.Â Diabetes happens because of one of the following: Diabetes is a lifelong disease. About 38.4 million Americans have the disease and one quarter (or approximately 8.7 million) are unaware that they have it. An additional 97.6 million people have prediabetes. As yet, there is no cure. People with diabetes need to manage their disease to stay healthy. When you have diabetes, it's important to keep track of your blood sugar levels. A continuous glucose monitor is one tool to help people with type 1 diabetes know how much insulin they need. (Photo Credit: VLAYKO/Getty Images) To understand why insulin is important in diabetes, it helps to know more about how your body uses food for energy. Your body is made up of millions of cells. To make energy, these cells need food in a very simple form. When you eat or drink, much of your food is broken down into a simple sugar called "glucose." Then, glucose is transported through your bloodstream to the cells of your body where it can be used to provide some of the energy your body needs for daily activities. The amount of glucose in your bloodstream is regulated by the hormone insulin. Insulin is always being released in small amounts by your pancreas. When the amount of glucose in your blood rises to a certain level, your pancreas will release more insulin to push more glucose into your cells. This causes your blood glucose level to drop. To keep it from getting too low (hypoglycemiaor low blood sugar), your body signals you to eat and releases some glucose stored in your liver. People with diabetes either don't make insulin or their body's cells are resistant to insulin, leading to high levels of sugar circulating in the blood, called simply high blood sugar. By definition, diabetes is having a blood glucose level of 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or more after an overnight fast (not eating anything). Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes happens because the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas (called beta cells) are destroyed by the immune system. People withtype 1 diabetesproduce no insulin and must use insulin injections to control their blood sugar. Symptoms most commonly start in people under the age of 20 but can develop at any age. Type 2 diabetes Unlike people with type 1 diabetes, people with type 2 diabetes produce insulin. However, either it isn't enough or their body is resistant to the insulin. In that situation, not enough glucose gets into the body's cells and it builds up in the bloodstream. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, affecting more than 36 million Americans. It's the leading cause of diabetes-related complications such as blindness, amputations, and chronic kidney failure requiringdialysis. Type 2 diabetes usually happens in people over age 40 who are overweight, but it can also affect those who aren't overweight. Sometimes referred to as "adult-onset diabetes," type 2 diabetes has started to appear more often in children because of the rise in obesity in young people. Some people can manage their type 2 diabetes by losing weight, watching their diet, and exercising regularly. Others may also need to take insulin injections or a pill that helps their body use insulin better. Prediabetes In the U.S., 97.6 million adults have blood sugar levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. This is calledprediabetes, or impaired glucose tolerance. People with prediabetes usually have no symptoms, but itâs almost always there before a person develops type 2 diabetes. Some complications, such as heart disease, can begin even when a person has only prediabetes. Talk to your doctor to see if you need to be tested for prediabetes. You may be able to prevent type 2 diabetes and lower your risk of complications. Gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes is triggered by pregnancy. Hormone changes during pregnancy can affect insulin's ability to work properly. The condition happens in up to 9% of all pregnancies. You have an increased risk of developing gestational diabetes if you're over 25 years old, were overweight before your pregnancy, have a family history of diabetes, or are Hispanic, Black, Native American, or Asian. You'll get screened for gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Left untreated, high blood sugar increases the risk of complications for both you and your child. Usually, blood sugar levels return to normal within 6 weeks of childbirth. However, having hadgestational diabetesincreases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Type 3 diabetes Some researchers have suggested that Alzheimer's disease is a form of diabetes that affects the brain, and propose calling it type 3 diabetes. They point to evidence that people with Alzheimer's have insulin resistance in their brains. The connection hasn't been proven, however, and most doctors don't use the term. Other types of diabetes There are several less common forms of diabetes, including: Monogenic diabetes.This includes several different types of diabetes caused by a gene mutation you inherit from one or both of your parents. When it appears in babies, it's called neonataldiabetes mellitus. In older children and young adults, it's called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Type 3c diabetes.This can develop if you've had your pancreas removed, or if it's damaged by illness or injury. Other types can come from taking steroid medications, having cystic fibrosis, or having certain rare inherited illnesses. The symptoms of type 1 diabetes often come on suddenly and can be severe. They include: The symptoms of type 2 diabetes may be the same as those of type 1. Most often, there are no symptoms or a very slow development of the above symptoms. Other symptoms may include: With gestational diabetes, there are often no symptoms. Or you might notice: By itself, pregnancy can make you pee more often and feel hungrier, so these symptoms donât always mean you have gestational diabetes. But it's important to get tested to avoid problems for both you and your baby. If you're having symptoms, you should be tested for the disease. Your doctor may also suggest screening if you're at higher risk. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends you get screened if you're between 35 and 70 years old and have overweight or obesity. Diabetes is diagnosedby measuring the amount of glucose in your blood. You'll typically need to have high levels on two separate days to get a diagnosis. If you have the disease, measuring your blood sugar is important for keeping it under control. There are several kinds of tests used. A1c test (glycated hemoglobin) This test measures the average of your blood sugar levels over 2-3 months. A result of 6.5% or higher means you have diabetes. A level between 5.7% and 6.4% is considered prediabetes. You'll be retested regularly to see whether your treatment plan is working. Fasting blood sugar test For this test, you won't be able to eat or drink anything but water for 8 hours before you have your blood drawn. A result of 126 mg/dL or more indicates diabetes. Between 100 mg/dL and 125 mg/dL is prediabetes. Random blood sugar test This test can be done at any time, whether you've eaten or not. You may get it if you're havingsymptoms of diabetesand doctors think it would be dangerous to wait for a fasting test. With this test, 200 mg/dL is considered too high. Glucose tolerance test This test takes place over 2 hours, and you'll also have to fast for 8 hours first. Your blood is drawn, and then you drink a very sweet liquid. Your blood is drawn again at 1 hour and 2 hours, and the three results are compared to see how your body manages the sugar. A result above 200 mg/dL at 2 hours means you have diabetes. A level between 140 mg/dL and 199 mg/dL is prediabetes. A different version of this test that doesn't require you to fast can be used to screen for gestational diabetes. If the result is high, you'll get a more extensive test. Autoantibody test This blood test doesn't measure your blood sugar, but it looks for certain immune system proteins that indicate you have type 1 rather than type 2 diabetes. You might get it if a blood sugar test is high, or if you have a parent or sibling with the disease. Urine ketone test When you have diabetes, you may need to test your urine for ketones from time to time. These are substances your body makes when it has to use fat rather than glucose for fuel. This can happen when you're low on insulin. Ketones in your urine are a sign of a dangerous condition called ketoacidosis, which needs immediate treatment. To take the test, you pee in a cup and dip a strip of a special paper into it. The paper changes color to show the level of ketones. There's no cure for diabetes, but it can be managed and controlled. The goals of managing diabetes are to: Treatment depends on what type of diabetes you have. It often includes a combination of medications, diet strategies, and lifestyle changes. An important part of treatment is keeping track of your blood sugar levels. People with type 1 and some people with type 2 diabetes need to test themselves several times a day to make sure their level stays within their target range and take action if it's too high or too low. This might be done by pricking your finger to get a small drop of blood or wearing a monitor that constantly measures your blood sugar through your skin. People with prediabetes and some people with type 2 diabetes only need their blood tested during checkups, which may be once or several times a year. Diabetes medications You may take medication several times a day, or on a daily or weekly schedule. Insulin.People with type 1 diabetes and some people with type 2 use insulin to allow their cells to absorb glucose. You inject this medication under your skin with a needle and syringe or a special pen. Your doctor will tell you when and how often to take insulin, but it's usually before meals. You could also wear a pump that delivers a steady dose throughout the day. Insulin is safe to take if you have gestational diabetes. Oral medications.Many people with type 2 diabetes take medication in pill form once or twice a day. You may take a combination of more than one type. These are among the most common: Other medications you take by mouth work with your digestion, slowing the breakdown of starches so your blood sugar stays steady. GLP-1 and GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists.Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide are naturally occurring hormones that tell your body to release insulin, slow the rate at which food moves out of your stomach, and send signals to your brain that make you feel full. These drugs mimic the action of those hormones, which helps lower your blood sugar. One medication comes as a pill, while the others you inject under your skin either once a week or once or twice a day. The FDA-approved GLP-1 receptor agonists for type 2 diabetes are: Tirzepatide is the only approved dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist. Other medications.To help prevent some of the complications that can come from from diabetes, your doctor may also prescribe blood pressure or cholesterol medications, or low-dose aspirin. Diabetes and diet What and when you eat plays an important part in controlling your blood glucose levels. Certain foods, such as sweets, soft drinks, and refined grains like white bread, are digested very quickly and cause your blood sugar to spike. Skipping a meal can make your blood sugar drop too low. When you have type 1 diabetes, you need to understand how the things you eat and drink affect your blood sugar, so you can be sure to get the right amount of insulin to stay in your target range. Your doctor will teach you to track nutrients, especially carbohydrates, and adjust your insulin doses. For everyone with diabetes or prediabetes, following a healthy diet can help you control your blood sugar, cholesterol, blood pressure, and weight. That includes: Things to limit or avoid include: Diabetes and exercise Physical activity helps your body use insulin better, which lowers your blood sugar. It can also help you keep your blood pressure and cholesterol down and manage your weight. Doctors recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise 5 days every week, plus 2 days of strength training. That can be walking at a brisk pace, swimming, or even dancing. Pick something you enjoy and will stick with, and check with your doctor before you start an exercise program. If you have type 1 diabetes, you may need to change your insulin dose or eat more carbs when you exercise so your blood sugar doesn't drop too low. Diabetes home remedies You hold the key to managing your diabetes. Take these steps to help control your blood sugar and prevent complications: Remember: What you do at home every day affects your blood sugar more than what your doctor can do every few months during your checkups. While you can't prevent type 1 diabetes, you can make lifestyle changes that will lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Ask your doctor if medications such asmetforminor weight loss drugs might be helpful. Diabetes is a disease in which your body has problems either making or using insulin. That leads to too much glucose (sugar) in your blood, which can cause serious health problems. You can lower your risk for the most common type, type 2 diabetes, by losing weight, being physically active, and following a healthy eating plan. Ask your doctor if you should have a screening blood sugar test. Can diabetes be reversed? People with type 2 diabetes can lower their blood sugar to levels that are no longer in the range of diabetes. Doctors call this remission. It's usually accomplished by losing weight. But type 2 diabetes can come back. Type 1 diabetes can't be reversed. If I have type 2 diabetes and take insulin, do I have to take it forever? Not necessarily. For some people, insulin is a short-term treatment to quickly lower your blood sugar. If diet, exercise, weight loss, and other medications bring your blood glucose levels under control, you may be able to stop taking insulin. Do sugary drinks cause diabetes? Not directly, but a study published in 2019 found an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes for people who drank 4 ounces of sugar-sweetened drinks, including soft drinks and juice, every day. Sugar from any source raises your blood sugar level. Over time, blood sugar that's too high makes your body less sensitive to insulin. How can I flush sugar out of my system fast? Taking fast-acting insulin, drinking water, and exercising can help lower your blood sugar quickly. But exercise is dangerous if you have ketoacidosis, so test your urine for ketones first if your blood sugar level is high. Call your doctor to find out if you need emergency treatment.

Diabetes happens when your blood sugar (blood glucose), which is your body's primary energy source, is too high. There are two types of diabetes: Extreme thirst is one of the most common early symptoms of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) Bothtypes of diabeteshave some of the same telltale warning signs. Increased hunger Your body converts the food you eat into glucose, which your cells use for energy. But your cells need insulin to take in glucose. If your body doesn't make enough or any insulin, or if your cells resist the insulin your body makes, the glucose can't get into them and you have no energy. This can make you hungrier than usual. Fatigue and tiredness A lack of insulin and glucose can also make you more tired than usual. Peeing more often The average person usually has to pee about four to seven times in 24 hours, but people with diabetes may go a lot more. Why? Normally, your body reabsorbs glucose as it passes through your kidneys. But when diabetes pushes yourblood sugarup, your kidneys may not be able to bring it all back in. This causes the body to make more urine, and that takes fluids. The result: You'll have to go more often. You might pee out more, too. Frequent thirst Because you're peeing so much, you can get very thirsty. Dry mouth Because your body is using fluids to make pee, there's less moisture for other things. You could get dehydrated, and your mouth may feel dry. Itchy and dry skin Your skin could also feel dry, which may start to itch as well. Blurred vision Changing fluid levels in your body could cause the lenses in your eyes to swell. They would then change shape and be unable to focus. Unintentional weight loss If your body can't get energy from your food, it will start burning muscle and fat for energy instead. You may lose weight even though you haven't changed how you eat. Can diabetes cause headaches? Headache may be a symptom ofhypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. It happens when your sugar or glucose level drops very low. How can you tell if you have diabetes? Most early symptoms are due to higher-than-normal glucose levels in your blood. While symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the same, there's a difference in how they appear. Intype 1 diabetes, symptoms show up quickly, in just a few days or weeks, especially in children. The four most common symptoms are: Type 2diabetes symptomsmay be mild and develop more slowly, especially early on in the disease. It's possible to go for years without realizing you have the condition. There's no major difference in early diabetes signs between men and women, but there may be a few contrasts. Women with the condition may have vaginal yeast infections and urinary tract infections more often, while men with untreated diabetes tend to lose muscle mass. Early symptoms of type 1 diabetes in children Type 1 diabetes can happen at any age but tends to crop up in children aged 5 to 6 and 11 to 13. Researchers think this is due to hormones at these ages. Symptoms include: Early symptoms of type 2 diabetes in children Adults are more likely to get type 2 diabetes, but the disease is happening more often in kids because of obesity. Your child may not show any symptoms of the disease, but here are some to look out for: High blood sugar duringpregnancyusually has no symptoms. You might feel a little thirstier than normal, have to pee more often, have a dry mouth, or feel tired. If you have an average chance of gettinggestational diabetes, your doctor will likely screen you for the condition between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. But your doctor may test you early in your pregnancy, possibly at your first prenatal visit, if: The screening involves drinking a sugary solution and having your blood sugar tested an hour later. If your blood sugar is high, you'll need a follow-up test, where you'll drink a stronger solution and have yourblood sugar testedevery hour for 3 hours. Signs of type 2 diabetes complications may include: Learn about what you can do to lower your risk of diabetes complications. If you're older than 45 or have other risks for diabetes, it's important to get tested. When you spot the condition early, you can avoid nerve damage,hearttrouble, and other complications. As a general rule, call your doctor if you: Diabetes often starts with mild symptoms such as feeling very hungry and tired, needing to pee a lot, being very thirsty, having a dry mouth, itchy skin, and blurry vision. Type 1 diabetes symptoms appear quickly and are more severe, whiletype 2 symptomsdevelop slowly. It's important to see a doctor if you have symptoms or have a higher chance of getting diabetes to avoid serious health problems.

Not everyone withtype 2 diabetesis overweight, but obesity and an inactive lifestyle are two of the most common causes of type 2 diabetes. These things are responsible for about 90%-95% of diabetes cases in the U.S. When you're healthy, your pancreas (an organ behind your stomach) releases insulin to help your body store and use sugar from the food you eat. Diabetes happens when one or more of the following happens: Unlike people with type 1 diabetes, people with type 2 diabetes do makeinsulin. But the insulin their pancreas releases isnât enough, or their body can't recognize and use the insulin properly. (Doctors call this insulin resistance.) When there isn't enough insulin orit isn't used as it should be,Â glucoseÂ (a type of sugar) can't enteryour cells. It builds up in your bloodstream instead. This can damage many areas of the body. Also, because cells aren't getting the glucose they need, they don't work the way they should. Weight and diabetes When you're overweight, you're at a higher risk for type 2 diabetes. This is especially true if your extra weight is in your belly. Extra weight leads to insulin resistance and dysfunction of specific cells in your body. One measure of obesity is body mass index (BMI), which estimates body fat based on weight and height. For men and those assigned male at birth who are older than 18, the lifetime risk of getting type 2 diabetes with a BMI of 18.5 or lower is 7%. The risk increases as your BMI increases. If your BMI is higher than 35, your risk of type 2 diabetes is 70%. For women and those assigned female at birth who are older than 18, the diabetes risk at 18.5 BMI is 12%, which grows to 74% with a BMI of 35 or greater. Losing 5%-10% of your overall body weight can improve your odds. Diet and diabetes Everything you eat affects your blood sugar levels. But foods that are high in simple carbohydrates, fat, and calories have a significant impact. Studies have found that eating lots of red meat, sweets, and fried food can lead to insulin resistance. Eating too much of these foods also contributes to weight gain, which increases your chances of diabetes. Diabetes and metabolic syndrome When you have metabolic syndrome, you have a set of risk factors that are linked to heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Those things include: Most people with metabolic syndrome have insulin resistance. Diabetes and PCOS When you have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), small cysts develop on your ovaries. Experts aren't really sure what causes PCOS, but weight and genes may play a role. Many people with PCOS have insulin resistance, which puts them at a higher risk for type 2 diabetes. Medications causing diabetes Some medicines you take for other conditions can make your blood sugar spike. The types of drugs linked to diabetes include: Gestational diabetesÂ This is a type of diabetes that begins when you're pregnant. Experts aren't exactly sure what causes it, though excess weight can play a role. The hormonal changes in your body during pregnancy may make it harder for your body to regulate your blood sugar. Usually, your blood sugar will return to normal once you've given birth. But gestational diabetes does raise your risk of having type 2 diabetes in the future. Your baby also has a higher risk of type 2 diabetes in the future. Smoking and diabetes If you smoke cigarettes, you're 30%-40% more likely to develop diabetes than a nonsmoker. The more you smoke, the more your risk increases. And when you have type 2 diabetes, smoking can make it harder to manage your condition and get your insulin dose right. Sleep and diabetes Sleep problems are associated with diabetes. If you don't get enough sleep, your body may not be sensitive enough to insulin. Disrupted sleep also can interfere with the hormones that control your body's glucose. One common sleep problem is sleep apnea, which is linked to obesity, another factor in diabetes. Diabetes itself can disturb your sleep -- for instance, if you have diabetes you may wake up often during the night to get a drink or pee. Many things can add to the risk of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes and family history Type 2 diabetes is believed to have a strong genetic link, meaning that it tends to run in families. If you have a parent, brother, or sister who has it, your chances are higher. Several genes may be related to type 2 diabetes. Health conditions related to diabetes If you have any of these conditions, you may want to ask your doctor about adiabetes test: Diabetes and race African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans are more likely to get type 2 diabetes than non-Hispanic whites. Diabetes and alcohol Drinking a lot of alcohol is linked to diabetes, though the relationship isn't entirely clear. Among other things, heavy drinking might cause you to gain weight, which is a risk factor for diabetes. LGBTQ and diabetes risk If you're lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer, you have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The reasons are complicated. Lesbian and bisexual women and transgender men are more likely to be overweight, a risk factor for diabetes. Studies suggest LGBTQ people may have more disrupted sleep, another factor that contributes to diabetes risk. Extra weight and disrupted sleep are both linked to long-term stress, and studies have found that LGBTQ people have extra stress in their lives because of their minority status. Other health conditions that may be more prevalent among LGBTQ people include HIV, PCOS, high blood pressure, heart disease, and kidney disease. All of these conditions can raise your diabetes risk. Diabetes and age The risk of type 2 diabetes begins to rise significantly around age 45 and rises considerably after age 65. Other risk factors Lifestyle issues can play a role in your diabetes risk. If you're not physically active, your risk goes up. Your risk also is increased if your diet is high in fat and simple carbohydrates. That can be the result of where you live and lack of access to healthy food.Â A proper diet andhealthy lifestyle habits, along with medication, can help you manage type 2 diabetes the same way you manage other areas of your life. Be sure to seek the latest information on this condition as you become your own health advocate. To understand why insulin is important, it helps to know more about how your body uses food for energy. Your body is made up of millions of cells. To make energy, these cells need food in a very simple form. When you eat or drink, much of the food is broken down into a simple sugar called glucose. It moves through your bloodstream to these cells, where it provides the energy your body needs for daily activities. Insulin and other hormones control the amount of glucose in your bloodstream. Your pancreas is always releasing small amounts of insulin. When the amount of glucose in your blood rises to a certain level, the pancreas will release more insulin to push more glucose into the cells. This causes the glucose levels in the blood (blood glucose levels) to drop. To keep blood glucose levels from getting too low (hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar), your body signals you to eat and releases some glucose from the stores kept in the liver. It also tells the body to release less insulin. People with diabetes either don't make insulin or their body's cells can no longer use their insulin. This leads to high blood sugar. By definition, diabetes is: When you have type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin, or it can't use the insulin it makes correctly. That causes glucose to build up in your blood, something that's called high blood sugar. The main causes of type 2 diabetes are obesity and an inactive lifestyle. But other conditions and even medicines you take can play a role. Many things can increase your risk of diabetes, including your family history, race, and age. What are the major risk factors for type 2 diabetes? Many things can increase your risk of diabetes, including your genes, age, and certain health conditions. Those include high blood pressure, high triglycerides, and low levels of HDL or "good" cholesterol. What are the causes of type 2 diabetes? The two main causes of type 2 diabetes are carrying excess weight -- especially in your belly -- and not getting enough exercise.

Diabetes mellitus, also called diabetes, is a term for several conditions involving how your body turns food into energy. The term comes from the Greek word âdiabetes,â which means to siphon or to pass through, and the Latin word âmellitus,â which means sweet. In 2021, 529 million people worldwide and 38.4 million in the U.S. had diabetes.Â When you eat a carbohydrate, your body turns it into a sugar called glucose and sends that to your bloodstream. Your pancreas releases insulin, a hormone that helps move glucose from your blood into your cells, which use it for energy. When you have diabetes and donât get treatment, your body doesnât use insulin like it should. Too much glucose stays in your blood, a condition usually calledhigh blood sugar. This can cause health problems that may be serious or even life-threatening. Thereâs no cure for diabetes. But with treatment and lifestyle changes, you can live a long, healthy life. Diabetes comes in different forms, depending on the cause. Prediabetes is when your blood sugar is higher than it should be but not high enough for your doctor to diagnose it as diabetes. Normal blood sugar levels are between 70 mg/dL and 99 mg/dL. Blood sugar levels in people with prediabetes are between 110 mg/dL and 125 mg/dL. Prediabetes often has no symptoms. More than a third of people in the U.S. have it, but about 90% don't know. If you have prediabetes, you might notice darkened skin on areas like your neck, armpits, and groin. Rarely, you may have other symptoms like: Over 70% of people with prediabetes later developtype 2 diabetes. Youâre also likely to start having heart, kidney, and nerve damage.Â You can lower these risks and potentially reverseprediabetesby:Â Your doctor might recommend medications like acarbose andmetforminif you canât follow these lifestyle changes or youâre at a very high risk of having type 2 diabetes.Â Type 1 diabetes is also called insulin-dependent diabetes. It used to be called juvenile-onset diabetes because it was thought to start more often in childhood. However, more research has shown it happens as frequently in children and adults.Â Type 1 diabetes is an organ-specific autoimmune condition. It happens when your body attacks your pancreas with antibodies. The organ is damaged and doesn't make insulin. It affects 2 million people, including about 304,000 children and teens in the U.S. Your genes might cause this type of diabetes. It could also happen because of problems with cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented.Â Type 1diabetes symptomshappen quickly, in a few days to weeks. They include: About 30% of people with type 1 diabetes have a life-threatening condition that causes loss of consciousness, called diabetic coma, as their first symptom.Â Get medical help immediately if you or your child show any of these symptoms: Many of the health problems that can come with type 1 happen because of damage to tiny blood vessels in your eyes (diabetic retinopathy), nerves (diabetic neuropathy), and kidneys (diabetic nephropathy). People with type 1 also have a higher risk of heart disease and stroke. A doctor may use a test called random plasma glucose (RPG) to check how much sugar you have in your blood when diagnosing type 1 diabetes. They may also use an A1c blood test to estimate your blood sugar levels over the last 3 months. Your doctor uses it to see how well your blood sugar is controlled. That helps them know your risk of complications. Treatment for type 1 diabetes involves injecting insulin into the fatty tissue just under your skin. You might use: If you have type 1 diabetes, youâll need to make changes, including: Type 2 diabetesÂ used to be called non-insulin-dependent or adult-onset diabetes. But itâs become more common in children and teens over the past 20 years, largely because more young people are overweight or obese. About 90% of people with diabetes have type 2. When you have type 2 diabetes, your pancreas usually creates some insulin. But either itâs not enough or your body doesnât use it like it should.ÂInsulin resistance, when your cells donât respond to insulin, usually happens in fat, liver, and muscle cells. Type 2 diabetes is often milder than type 1. But it can still cause major health complications, especially in the tiny blood vessels in your kidneys, nerves, and eyes. Type 2 also raises your risk ofÂ heart diseaseÂ andÂ stroke. People who have obesity -- more than 20% over their target body weight for their height -- have an especially high risk of type 2 diabetes and the health problems that can follow. Obesity often causesÂ insulin resistance, so your pancreas has to work harder to make more insulin. But itâs still not enough to keep your blood sugar levels where they should be. Treatment for type 2 diabetesinvolves keeping a healthy weight, eating right, and exercising. Some people need medication, too. Your doctor might do an A1c test a few times a year to see how well youâve been controlling your blood sugar. Pregnancy usually causes some form of insulin resistance. If this becomes diabetes, itâs called gestational. Doctors often spot it in 2%-10% of pregnancies. You may be diagnosed in the middle or late pregnancy with a:Â It usually causes no or mild symptoms like feeling thirstier or peeing more often. It goes away after giving birth. But people who have had gestational diabetes are 8-10 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes and have twice the risk of developing heart disease compared to those who have not had it.Â Â If youâve had gestational diabetes, youâll need to be tested for type 2 diabetes every 3 years for the rest of your life. If you get gestational diabetes while pregnant, your symptoms should go away once you have your baby. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Gestational diabetesis more of a risk for thebabythan the mother. Because your blood sugars travel through their placenta to the baby, itâs important to control gestational diabetes to protect the baby's growth and development.Â A baby might have unusual weight gain before birth, trouble breathing at birth, or a higher risk of obesity and diabetes later in life. You might need a cesarean section because of an overly large baby, or they might have damage to their heart, kidney, nerves, and eyes. Gestational diabetes treatment involves: Rarely, diabetes can happen due to changes in a single gene that can affect how much insulin the body can produce. When this is the case, it is called monogenic diabetes.Â The gene mutation is often passed down from one or both parents. However, gene mutations may also happen unexpectedly.Â In the U.S., monogenic diabetes happens in 1% to 4% of all diabetes cases.Â The two main types of monogenic diabetes are Many times, doctors mistake monogenic diabetes for type 2 diabetes. But a doctor might suspect monogenic diabetes if:Â Then, they recommend genetic testing to confirm it and determine which specific type you have. They might also test your family members to see if they have it. You may get diabetes medicines you take by mouth or insulin injections to treat it. Secondary diabetes is a type of diabetes that happens because of another primary condition, which may include: Medications like steroids may also trigger secondary diabetes.Â Treatment may involve managing the underlying cause, making lifestyle changes, and taking insulin and other medications to control yourblood sugar levels. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the most common types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes affects 1.3 million people in the U.S., and type 2 diabetes occurs in 37 million people.Â Type 1 diabetes happens when the immune system mistakenly attacks your pancreas, causing it to stop producing insulin. Both genetic and environmental factors play a role in causing this immune response.Â Type 2 diabetes is a hormonal condition that happens when your body doesn't respond well to insulin, which leads to high blood sugar levels. With time, the pancreas in people with type 2 diabetes may stop working as well as it should until it stops being able to produce insulin. Type 1 diabetes symptoms usually happen suddenly within a few days to a week. Type 2 diabetes symptoms take a while, about a year, to develop. People with type 1 diabetes need insulin medicine because the body canât make it anymore. People with type 2 diabetes only need insulin when their pancreas stops making it.Â Diabetes is a group of conditions that affect how well your body turns food into energy. It causes high blood sugar levels that can lead to serious health issues like heart disease, eye damage,dementia, stroke, and kidney damage. Your doctor will manage it depending on the type you have. You may need insulin injections and antidiabetic medicines. Theyâll also recommend following lifestyle changes like eating a healthy diet and exercising.Â Â Is type 2 diabetes manageable? Yes, type 2 diabetes is manageable with medicines and healthy lifestyle changes. What causes diabetes mellitus? What causes diabetes will depend on the type. It may be related to your genes, lifestyle, and family history. But all forms of diabetes cause you to have high blood sugar levels. What are diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2? Types 1 and 2 diabetes are the most common type of diabetes.Type 1 diabeteshappens when your immune system attacks and damages your pancreas, causing it to stop making enough insulin. Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body stops using insulin well.

The following tests are used to diagnose diabetes: Ahemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testcan be done without fasting and can be used to diagnose or confirm either prediabetes or diabetes. If you get a positive test result, meaning you have diabetes or prediabetes, your doctor will confirm this by repeating the fasting plasma glucose test or theoral glucose tolerance teston a different day.Â Another test, thezinctransporter 8 autoantibody test, can help determine if a person has type 1 diabetes and not another type. This test is most reliable when done in the morning. The results and their meaning are shown in Table 1. If your fasting glucose level is 100 to 125 mg/dL, you have a form of prediabetes called impaired fasting glucose (IFG), meaning that you're more likely to develop type 2 diabetes but don't have it yet. A level of 126 mg/dL or above, confirmed by repeating the test on another day, means you have diabetes. Table 1. Fasting Plasma Glucose Test *Confirmed by repeating the test on a different day. Research has shown that the OGTT is more sensitive than the FPG test for diagnosing prediabetes, but it is less convenient to give. The OGTT requires you to fast for at least 8 hours before the test. Your plasma glucose is measured immediately before and 2 hours after you drink a liquid containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. Results and what they mean are shown in Table 2. If your blood sugar level is between 140 and 199 mg/dL 2 hours after drinking the liquid, you have a form of prediabetes called impaired glucose tolerance or IGT, meaning that you're more likely to developtype 2 diabetesbut don't have it yet. A 2-hour glucose level of 200 mg/dL or above, confirmed by repeating the test on another day, means that you have diabetes. Table 2. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test *Confirmed by repeating the test on a different day. Gestational diabetes is also diagnosed with the OGTT. Blood sugar levels are checked four times during the test. If yourblood sugar levelsare above normal at least twice during the test, you have gestational diabetes. Table 3 shows the above-normal results for the OGTT forgestational diabetes. Table 3. Gestational Diabetes: Above-Normal Results for the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test Note: Some laboratories use other numbers for this test. Glucose challenge test This test, also called the 1-hour glucose tolerance test, is a shorter version of the OGTT. This shorter test can better predict type 2 diabetes than other types of tests.Â Â If your blood glucose reading 1 hour after drinking the 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water is at or above 155 mg/dL, youâre considered to have intermediate hyperglycemia. If your blood glucose levels are greater than or equal to 209 mg/dL, you have type 2 diabetes.Â A random blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or more, plus presence of the following symptoms, can mean that you have diabetes: Other symptoms include fatigue, blurred vision, increasedhunger, and sores that don't heal. Your doctor will check your blood glucose level on another day using the FPG or the OGTT to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. Â This test tells you what percentage of your hemoglobin (the protein in your blood that carries oxygen) is coated with glucose. Your doctor gives you this test by using a needle to collect a sample of blood from your arm. The blood sample goes to a lab for results. YourHbA1creading gives your doctor a snapshot of your blood glucose control over several months. An HbA1c of 5.7% to 6.4% points to prediabetes and marks a time when it can be reversed by lifestyle changes. An HbA1c of 6.5% or higher is considered diabetes. Table 4. HbA1c Test HbA1c Diagnosis Below 5.7% Normal Between 5.7% and 6.4% Prediabetes 6.5% or higher Diabetes Â HbA1c tests donât diagnose type 1 or gestational diabetes, only type 2 diabetes.Â As your doctor collects data to confirm a diabetes diagnosis, these are the values they follow as a guideline: Table 5. Diagnostic Criteria for Prediabetes Test Result HbA1c 5.7-6.4% Fasting blood glucose 100-125 mg/dL 2-hour OGTT blood glucose 140-199 mg/dL Table 6. Diagnostic Criteria for Diabetes Test Result HbA1c 6.5% or higher Fasting blood glucose 126 mg/dL or higher 2-hour OGTT blood glucose 200 mg/dL or higher If your doctor confirms adiabetes diagnosis, they may want to do further tests to decide if you haveÂ type 1 diabetes. This is especially important for children and people who donât have other risk factors for diabetes who get a diabetes diagnosis.Â Autoantibody test.Your doctor may suggest a zinc transporter 8 autoantibody (ZnT8Ab) test. The goal of having thisÂ blood test is to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis that can lead to timely treatment. C-peptide test (Insulin in blood test).ÂThis test helps measure how muchinsulinyour pancreas is making. Your pancreas releases equal amounts of insulin and C-peptide into your bloodstream at the same time. C-peptide doesn't affect your blood glucose levels, but it stays in your blood longer than insulin. Your doctor will take a small sample of blood and send it to a lab for this test.Â Ketones.Â Your doctor can test your urine using a paper test strip to look for ketones. Ketones are acids your body makes when itâs usingfatinstead of glucose for energy. This can be a sign oftype 1 diabetes. There are many tests that confirm a diabetes diagnosis, including a fasting plasma glucose test, oral glucose tolerance test, random plasma glucose test, and hemoglobin A1c test. These tests tell your doctor if you have diabetes or are at risk of developing it (prediabetes). How do you diagnose diabetes?Your doctor can diagnose diabetes with blood tests. They may want to do more than one type to be sure of the diagnosis. If your doctor thinks you may have type 1 diabetes, they may do further tests on your blood to look for autoantibodies or look at your urine forketones.Â How do I accept a diabetes diagnosis?Learning you have diabetes can make you feel a range of emotions. Know that over 38 million Americans live with diabetes. There are many organizations and support groups to help with emotional health, diet management, and lifestyle tips to help you live well with diabetes.Â What should you do when first diagnosed with diabetes?Educate yourself on your condition so you feel empowered to take good care of yourself. Write down any questions you have and bring them with you to your doctor so you continue to understand more. Reach out to other people already living with diabetes for advice and support. Follow your treatment plan as your doctor directs.Â Â What do you say to a newly diagnosed diabetic person?If someone in your life gets a diabetes diagnosis, ask them how you can help them process the news. Be a good listener. Learn about diabetes yourself so you can be a helpful partner in conversation or in day-to-day life as they learn to manage it. Support from friends and family can help people with diabetes manage their condition better.Â How does a doctor diagnose diabetes type 1?After a diabetes diagnosis, there are further tests your doctor can use to see if you have type 1 diabetes.Â These include tests on your blood to look for autoantibodies, tests to see how much insulin your pancreas is making, or urine tests that look for ketones.Â SOURCES:Â American Diabetes Association:Â âDiabetes Diagnosis and Tests,â âNewly Diagnosed with Diabetes.âÂ National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.Â Medscape: âIs a 1-Hour Glucose Test Better at Predicting T2D Risk?â MedlinePlus: âHemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) Test,â âInsulin in Blood.â Mayo Clinic: âType 1 Diabetes.â CDC: âTesting for Diabetes,â âHelping Friends and Family With Diabetes.â Diabetes UK: âCoping with a Diabetes Diagnosis.â Â© 2005 - 2025 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

Your doctor may suspect you have diabetes if you have some risk factors for diabetes, or if you have high levels of blood sugar in your urine. Your blood sugar (also called blood glucose) levels may be high if your pancreas is producing little or no insulin (type 1 diabetes), or if the body is not responding normally to insulin (type 2 diabetes). Getting diagnosed begins with one of three tests. In most cases, your doctor will want to repeat a test that is high in order to confirm the diagnosis: Your doctor may also suggest a zinc transporter 8 autoantibody (ZnT8Ab) test. This blood test -- along with other information and test results -- can help determine if a person has type 1 diabetes instead of another type. The goal of having the ZnT8Ab test is a prompt and accurate diagnosis, and that can lead to timely treatment. Diabetes is a serious disease that you cannot treat on your own. Your doctor will help you make a diabetes treatment plan that is right for you -- and that you can understand. You may also need other health care professionals on your diabetes treatment team, including a foot doctor, nutritionist, eye doctor, and a diabetes specialist (called an endocrinologist). Treatment for diabetes requires keeping close watch over your blood sugar levels (and keeping them at a goal set by your doctor) with a combination of medications, exercise, and diet. By paying close attention to what and when you eat, you can minimize or avoid the "seesaw effect" of rapidly changing blood sugar levels, which can require quick changes in medication dosages, especially insulin.Â Find outhow to choose the right diabetes treatment for you. If you have type 1 diabetes, your pancreas no longer makes the insulin your body needs to use blood sugar for energy. You will need insulin in the form of injections or through use of a continuous pump. Learning to give injections to yourself or to your infant or child may at first seem the most daunting part of managing diabetes, but it is much easier thanÂ you think. Some people with diabetes use a computerized pump -- called aninsulin pump-- that gives insulin on a set basis. You and your doctor program the pump to deliver a certain amount of insulin throughout the day (the basal dose). Plus, you program the pump to deliver a certain amount of insulin based on your blood sugar level before you eat (bolus dose). Injectable insulin comes in five types: A rapid-actinginhaled insulin(Afrezza) is also FDA-approved for use before meals. It must be used in combination with long-acting insulin in patients withtype 1 diabetesand should not be used by those who smoke or have chronic lung disease. It comes as a single dose cartridge.Premixed insulin is also available for people who need to use more than one type of insulin. Insulin degludec (Tresiba) is a once-daily, long-acting insulin, providing a basal dose of insulin lasting beyond 42 hours. (It's the only basal insulin approved for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in patients as young as 1 year old.) It is also available in combination with rapid-acting insulin (Ryzodeg 70/30). Each treatment plan is tailored for the person and can be adjusted based on what you eat and how much you exercise, as well as for times of stress and illness. By checking your own blood sugar levels, you can track your body's changing needs for insulin and work with your doctor to figure out the best insulin dosage. People with diabetes check their blood sugar up to several times a day with an instrument called a glucometer. The glucometer measures glucose levels in a sample of your blood dabbed on a strip of treated paper. Also, there are now devices, called continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS), that can be attached to your body to measure your blood sugars every few minutes for up to a week at a time. But these machines check glucose levels from skin rather than blood, and they are less accurate than a traditional glucometer. For some people withtype 2 diabetes, diet and exercise are enough to keep the disease under control. Other people need medication, which may include insulin and an oral drug. Drugs for type 2 diabetes work in different ways to bring blood sugar levels back to normal. They include: Some pills contain more than one type of diabetes medication. They include the recently approvedempagliflozin/linagliptin(Glyxambi). It combines a SGLT2 inhibitor that blocks reabsorption of glucose into the kidneys with a DPP-4 inhibitor which increases hormones to help the pancreas produce more insulin and the liver produce less glucose. Eating a balanced diet is vital for people who have diabetes, so work with your doctor or dietitian to set up a menu plan. If you have type 1 diabetes, the timing of your insulin dosage is determined by activity and diet. When you eat and how much you eat are just as important as what you eat. Usually, doctors recommend three small meals and three to four snacks every day to maintain the proper balance between sugar and insulin in the blood. A healthy balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in your diet will help keep your blood glucose on target. How much of each will depend on many factors, including your weight and your personal preferences. Watching your carbohydrates -- knowing how much you need and how many you are eating -- is key to blood sugar control. If you are overweight, either a low-carbohydrate, low-fat/low calorie, or Mediterranean diet may help you get your weight to goal. No more than 7% of your diet should come from saturated fat, and you should try to avoid trans fats altogether. Try to fill half your plate with nonstarchy vegetables such as: Also, make sure to get some of these: You can also get protein from vegetarian options like tofu. Stick to whole-grain foods. If you eat cereals, check the ingredients and make sure whole grain is first on the list. Examples of whole grains include: In general, less-processed food is better. It has a lowerglycemic index, which means it may have less of an effect on your blood sugar. For example, oatmeal from whole oats has a lower glycemic index than instant oatmeal. If you have type 2 diabetes and follow a healthy diet and exercise routine, you could lose weight and improve your diabetes. One study found long-term weight loss through diet and exercise could lower your chances of having a stroke and dementia. Another crucial element in a treatment program for diabetes is exercise. With either type of diabetes, check with your doctor before starting an exercise program. Exercise improves your body's use of insulin and may lower blood sugar levels. To prevent your blood sugar from falling to dangerously low levels, check your blood sugar and, if necessary, eat a carbohydrate snack about half an hour before exercising. If you start to feel symptoms of low blood sugar (called hypoglycemia), stop exercising and have a carbohydrate snack or drink. Wait 15 minutes and check again. Have another snack again if it is still too low. Exercise helps some people with type 2 diabetes lower their blood glucose levels and may help prevent the disease in those at risk. For people with either type of diabetes, exercise can lower the chance of having a heart attack or stroke and can improve circulation. It may offer stress relief, as well. People with type 2 diabetes who need to lose weight can benefit from moderate exercise. Most people with diabetes are encouraged to get at least 150 minutes each week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity, like walking. Strength training is often recommended at least twice a week. Talk to your doctor about what type of exercise is right for you. Learn how to start (and stick with) a workout routine when you have diabetes. If you aren't active now, start slow. Then build up how much exercise you get over time. Shoot for four to seven periods of activity each week. Try to make each period last at least 30 minutes. And you don't have to work out at the gym to be active. Take the stairs instead of an elevator, or park at the far end of the lot. Both add exercise to your daily routine. Have a realistic goal and make a plan. What exercises will you do, and when will you do them? For example, you might plan to walk 30 minutes most days on your lunch break. Change your activities often enough so you don't get bored. You can do aerobic activities like walking or jogging. And resistance exercises like working out with weights offer another option. Whatever you do, don't forget to stretch before and after each workout session. It's important to realize that exercise lowers your blood sugar. Talk to your doctor about whether you need to adjust your meds or insulin dose to keep your levels high enough. Wear a medical ID tag It is a good idea to wear a MedicAlert bracelet or tag that says you have diabetes. This will make others aware of your condition in case you have a severe hypoglycemic attack and are not able to make yourself understood, or if you are in an accident and need emergency medical care. Identifying yourself as having diabetes is important because hypoglycemic attacks can be mistaken for drunkenness, and victims often aren't able to care for themselves. Without prompt treatment,hypoglycemiacan result in a coma or seizures. And, because your body is under increased stress when you are ill or injured, your blood sugar levels will need to be checked by the medical personnel who give you emergency care. Take care of your teeth Be sure to take good care of your teeth and floss regularly. Diabetes can worsen gum disease. Reduce stress If you're stressed, you may exercise less, drink more, and not watch your diabetes as closely. Stress can also raise your blood sugar and make you less sensitive to insulin. When you're stressed, your body adopts a "fight or flight" response. That means it will make sure you have enough sugar and fat available for energy. Studies of people with type 1 diabetes found blood sugar levels go up for most people under mentalstressand down for others. If you have type 2 diabetes and you're feeling pressure, your glucose will go up. If something has you bothered, try to make changes that can help you relax. You might exercise, spend time with friends, meditate, or replace negative thoughts with positive ones. Do whatever works for you. Support groups,counseling, or therapy can help, too. Quit smoking Kick the habit. It'll give you better control of your blood sugar levels. If you smoke, you're also more likely to have serious health problems as well as a higher chance for complications from diabetes. Those can include: Cut back on alcohol If you're on insulin or oral diabetes meds like sulfonylureas or meglitinides, drinking alcohol can drop blood sugar to dangerous levels. When you drink, your liver has to work to remove the alcohol from your blood instead of regulating your blood sugar. Drunkenness and low blood sugar can also cause dizziness, disorientation, and sleepiness. You could confuse the symptoms of too much alcohol and low blood sugar. A woman should have no more than one drink a day. For men, the limit is two drinks per day. One drink is 12 ounces of beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine, or an ounce and a half of liquor like vodka. With mixed drinks, choose no-calorie mixers like club soda or diet soda. Try switching to a light beer or wine spritzer. You can also sip more slowly or switch to water or another calorie-free drink. If you cut back on the drinks, you may eat better. Alcohol can lower your willpower to resist overeating. Take notes Keeping a detailed daily log can help you track what affects your glucose levels. That log can include: After a week or so, see if you notice any patterns. If you're trying to lose weight, write down everything you eat or drink for a week or two, including portion size. That'll give you a clear picture of where you stand and what changes you can make. If you drink alcohol, check your blood sugar before you drink, while you drink, before you go to bed, and the following day. Alcohol lowers blood sugar for up to 24 hours after you finish your last drink. Vitamins and minerals Alternative medicine should never be used alone to treat diabetes. But there are things you can do -- in addition to medication, proper diet, and exercise -- that may help control your blood sugar and preventcomplications of diabetes. Although chromium does have an effect on insulin as well as on glucose metabolism, there is no evidence that taking chromium supplements can help in the treatment of diabetes. But chromium is found in many healthy foods, such as green vegetables, nuts, and grains. Studies have suggested that biotin, also called vitamin H, when used with chromium, may improve glucose metabolism in people with diabetes. But no studies have shown that biotin by itself is helpful. Vitamins B6 and B12may help treat diabetic nerve pain if you have low levels of these vitamins and that is contributing to the nerve pain. But otherwise, there is no proof that taking these vitamins will help. Vitamin Cmay make up for low blood levels of insulin, which normally works to help cells absorb the vitamin. Proper amounts of vitamin C may help the body maintain a good cholesterol level and keep blood sugar levels under control. But too much can cause kidney stones and other problems. Check with your doctor to see if a vitamin C supplement is right for you. Vitamin Emay help limit damage to the blood vessels and help protect against kidney and eye disease. But too much can lead to serious problems, such as a higher risk of stroke. Talk to your doctor before adding this supplement. Magnesiumhelps control blood sugar levels. Some people with diabetes have a serious magnesium deficiency. Magnesium supplements, in this case, may improve the action of insulin. Mind/body medicine Guided imagery, biofeedback, meditation, hypnotherapy, and yoga reduce stress hormones, which in turn may help stabilize blood sugar levels. Biofeedback may also help lower blood pressure, but more research is needed to discover its role in the treatment of diabetes and high blood pressure. Herbal remedies Capsaicin cream, a topical ointment made with cayenne, has been reported by some patients to help lower pain in the hands and feet from diabetic neuropathy. But people with loss of sensation in the hands or feet should use caution when using capsaicin, as they may not be able to fully feel any burning sensation. Check with your doctor if you are thinking of trying this product. Evening primrose oilis thought to help diabetic nerve pain, but no conclusive evidence has yet been found. Ginkgo, garlic, holy basil leaves, fenugreek seeds, ginseng, and hawthorn are other herbals that have been promoted by some as remedies fordiabetic symptoms. More research is needed to see what, if any, role these herbals may play. Check with your doctor before trying any herbal product.

If it is not controlled,diabetescan cause a host of complications that can affect nearly every organ in the body. Diabetes complications include: Heart disease is one of the most common diabetes complications. In office visits, your doctor may perform various tests to check for heart disease and help you prevent any serious heart-related problems. At every visit, your health care provider will check your blood pressure by placing a cuff around your upper arm that tightens to read the flow of blood through your arteries. They'll also take a small blood sample from your arm to check levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. A baseline EKG should also be obtained as part of a complete medical record. Learn more about personal risk factors you have for heart disease, such as a family history or whether you smoke, and work out a prevention plan that includes weight loss, regular exercise, and stress management, as well as keeping your blood pressure, cholesterol, andtriglyceridesat normal levels. Signs and symptoms of stroke include sudden weakness on one side of the face or body; numbness in the face, arm, or leg; difficulty speaking; trouble seeing with both eyes; or dizziness. If you have any of these symptoms, see a doctor immediately. You may be referred to a neurologist or other stroke specialist. Read more about thewarning signs of strokeand also be aware of ways to prevent this serious problem from happening to you. If you have diabetes, urine testing should be performed yearly to look for diabetic nephropathy -- kidney disease. A baseline creatinineblood test should also be done to determine your kidney function. You may need to be tested more often if you're likely to get kidney disease because of high blood pressure, heart disease, or a family history of kidney failure. Your doctor will check a sample of your urine for albumin, a blood protein that can end up in your pee if your kidneys are damaged. They'll also take a sample of your blood to check yourglomerular filtration rate(GFR), a measure of how well your kidneys are doing their job of filtering waste in your blood. Your health care provider will also check your blood pressure regularly, because control of high blood pressure is essential in slowing kidney disease. Your reading should be less than 130/80. Over time, diabetes can cause nerve damage that produces symptoms of numbness, burning, or pain in your hands, feet, or legs. If your skin becomes numb, you may not notice small wounds that could grow to become bigger health threats. Check your feet and hands daily for redness,calluses, cracks, or skin breakdown. If you notice any of these symptoms before your next scheduled visit, notify your health care provider immediately. To check for these problems, your doctor will thoroughly examine your feet at least once a year. They'll tap on them with a tool similar to a nylon hairbrush bristle or prick your feet with a small needle. If you don't feel it, you may have nerve damage. If you're diagnosed withperipheral diabetic neuropathy, you'll need thorough foot exams at every doctor's visit. To protect your vision, all people with diabetes should see an ophthalmologist (an eye doctor) at least yearly. As part of the eye exam, the doctor will dilate your eyes so that they can see the back of the eye (the retina) and determine if the diabetes is causing damage. For this test, your doctor puts drops into your eyes that temporarily make your pupils get bigger. Then, they use a special magnifying lens to check your retina and optic nerves. They'll also test your eye pressure, side vision, and distance vision. The test is painless. But since you'll be sensitive to light and your vision will remain blurry for a few hours, it's a good idea to bring sunglasses and get someone else to drive you home. In people with type 1 diabetes, these annual exams should start within three to five years of diabetes once the patient is age 10 or older. People with type 2 diabetes should have their first eye exam once they are diagnosed. Those with eye complications may need to see their ophthalmologist more frequently. Women with diabetes who become pregnant should have a comprehensive eye exam during the first trimester and close follow-up with an eye doctor during their pregnancy. (This recommendation does not apply to women who developgestational diabetes.) Diabetes increases your risk ofgastroparesis. With gastroparesis, the nerves to the stomach are damaged and stop working properly. This causes the stomach to take too long to empty its contents and makes it difficult to manage bloodglucose levels. Sometimes, changing your diet can help. There are some medications and treatments for gastroparesis. You may need one or more of these tests: These tests mostly involve eating or drinking something or getting an imaging test (like an X-ray) to help doctors check if your digestive system is working well. Talk to your doctor about ways to prevent diabetes complications. Ask for information on early warning signs so you can seek treatment when it is most effective. Diabetes increases the chance of developingerectile dysfunction, or impotence. For some men, adopting a healthier lifestyle, such as quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and reducing stress, may be all that is needed to resolve erectile dysfunction. It's important to talk to your health care provider about your erectile dysfunction, as your doctor can recommend other remedies -- including medications, a vacuum constriction device (VCD), and other erectile dysfunction aids -- that can help. As many as a third of people with diabetes will have a skin condition related to their disease at some time in their lives. High levels of glucose in the blood provide an excellent breeding ground for bacteria and fungi and can reduce the body's ability to heal itself. Fortunately, most skin conditions can be prevented and successfully treated if caught early. If your skin is not cared for properly with type 2 diabetes, a minor skin condition can turn into a serious problem with potentially severe consequences. Type 2 diabetesslows down your body's ability to fight infection. High blood glucose leads to high levels of sugar in your body's tissues. When this happens, bacteria grow and infections can develop more quickly. Common sites of infection are your bladder, kidneys, vagina, gums, feet, and skin. Early treatment of infections can prevent more serious complications. People with diabetes face a higher than normal risk of serious dental and oral health problems. The more uncontrolled the blood sugar, the more likely dental and oral health problems will arise. This is because uncontrolled diabetes impairs white blood cells, which are the body's main defense against infections that can occur in the mouth. Over time, untreated plaque can lead to tooth decay,gum disease(gingivitis), periodontitis, and tooth loss. So keep an eye out for signs of gum problems, including swollen, tender, or bleeding gums. Whether you have diabetes or not, be sure to brush, floss, and rinse with antiseptic mouthwash daily. See your dentist for regular cleanings and checkups to prevent serious dental problems. Most diabetes complications are linked to blood sugar levels that are too high or too low. AnA1c blood testis a key way to check that your blood sugar levels aren't out of whack. Until your blood sugar levels are stable, your doctor may do an A1c test four times a year. From then on, you'll get tested twice a year. Your doctor will take a sample of blood from your arm or finger to measure your average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months. If you take insulin or have blood sugar levels that are out of control, your doctor may also recommend that you test yourself at home as often as several times every day. You'll prick your finger and place a drop of blood on a disposable test strip that feeds into a portable bloodglucose meter. Your doctor may also prescribe aÂ continuing glucose monitor in which a sensor is inserted under your skin and continually monitors your glucose levels. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) test When your cells don't get enough glucose, they start to burn fat for energy, which makes things called ketones. High ketone levels signal that your diabetes is out of control or that you're getting sick. This can lead todiabetic ketoacidosis(DKA), a dangerous complication. Your doctor may suggest you take a sample of your urine at home and check ketone levels with a special test strip if: Thyroid tests Diabetes is linked to a condition called hypothyroidism. This is when your thyroid gland doesn't make enough of the hormones that control your metabolism. The American Diabetes Association recommends universal screening forÂ thyroid in type 1 diabetes. You may get tested every 1 to 2 years if you have a higher chance of gettinghypothyroidismbecause you're a woman over 40 or you have a family history of thyroid disease.

Diabetes is a disorder of metabolism -- the way our bodies use digested food for growth and energy. There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.

Diabetes is a disease that involves problems with the way your body makes or manages the hormone insulin. It's also known as diabetes mellitus. Normally, your pancreas (an organ behind the stomach) releases insulin to help your body store and use the sugar and fat from the food you eat.Â Diabetes happens because of one of the following: Diabetes is a lifelong disease. About 38.4 million Americans have the disease and one quarter (or approximately 8.7 million) are unaware that they have it. An additional 97.6 million people have prediabetes. As yet, there is no cure. People with diabetes need to manage their disease to stay healthy. When you have diabetes, it's important to keep track of your blood sugar levels. A continuous glucose monitor is one tool to help people with type 1 diabetes know how much insulin they need. (Photo Credit: VLAYKO/Getty Images) To understand why insulin is important in diabetes, it helps to know more about how your body uses food for energy. Your body is made up of millions of cells. To make energy, these cells need food in a very simple form. When you eat or drink, much of your food is broken down into a simple sugar called "glucose." Then, glucose is transported through your bloodstream to the cells of your body where it can be used to provide some of the energy your body needs for daily activities. The amount of glucose in your bloodstream is regulated by the hormone insulin. Insulin is always being released in small amounts by your pancreas. When the amount of glucose in your blood rises to a certain level, your pancreas will release more insulin to push more glucose into your cells. This causes your blood glucose level to drop. To keep it from getting too low (hypoglycemiaor low blood sugar), your body signals you to eat and releases some glucose stored in your liver. People with diabetes either don't make insulin or their body's cells are resistant to insulin, leading to high levels of sugar circulating in the blood, called simply high blood sugar. By definition, diabetes is having a blood glucose level of 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or more after an overnight fast (not eating anything). Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes happens because the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas (called beta cells) are destroyed by the immune system. People withtype 1 diabetesproduce no insulin and must use insulin injections to control their blood sugar. Symptoms most commonly start in people under the age of 20 but can develop at any age. Type 2 diabetes Unlike people with type 1 diabetes, people with type 2 diabetes produce insulin. However, either it isn't enough or their body is resistant to the insulin. In that situation, not enough glucose gets into the body's cells and it builds up in the bloodstream. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, affecting more than 36 million Americans. It's the leading cause of diabetes-related complications such as blindness, amputations, and chronic kidney failure requiringdialysis. Type 2 diabetes usually happens in people over age 40 who are overweight, but it can also affect those who aren't overweight. Sometimes referred to as "adult-onset diabetes," type 2 diabetes has started to appear more often in children because of the rise in obesity in young people. Some people can manage their type 2 diabetes by losing weight, watching their diet, and exercising regularly. Others may also need to take insulin injections or a pill that helps their body use insulin better. Prediabetes In the U.S., 97.6 million adults have blood sugar levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. This is calledprediabetes, or impaired glucose tolerance. People with prediabetes usually have no symptoms, but itâs almost always there before a person develops type 2 diabetes. Some complications, such as heart disease, can begin even when a person has only prediabetes. Talk to your doctor to see if you need to be tested for prediabetes. You may be able to prevent type 2 diabetes and lower your risk of complications. Gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes is triggered by pregnancy. Hormone changes during pregnancy can affect insulin's ability to work properly. The condition happens in up to 9% of all pregnancies. You have an increased risk of developing gestational diabetes if you're over 25 years old, were overweight before your pregnancy, have a family history of diabetes, or are Hispanic, Black, Native American, or Asian. You'll get screened for gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Left untreated, high blood sugar increases the risk of complications for both you and your child. Usually, blood sugar levels return to normal within 6 weeks of childbirth. However, having hadgestational diabetesincreases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Type 3 diabetes Some researchers have suggested that Alzheimer's disease is a form of diabetes that affects the brain, and propose calling it type 3 diabetes. They point to evidence that people with Alzheimer's have insulin resistance in their brains. The connection hasn't been proven, however, and most doctors don't use the term. Other types of diabetes There are several less common forms of diabetes, including: Monogenic diabetes.This includes several different types of diabetes caused by a gene mutation you inherit from one or both of your parents. When it appears in babies, it's called neonataldiabetes mellitus. In older children and young adults, it's called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Type 3c diabetes.This can develop if you've had your pancreas removed, or if it's damaged by illness or injury. Other types can come from taking steroid medications, having cystic fibrosis, or having certain rare inherited illnesses. The symptoms of type 1 diabetes often come on suddenly and can be severe. They include: The symptoms of type 2 diabetes may be the same as those of type 1. Most often, there are no symptoms or a very slow development of the above symptoms. Other symptoms may include: With gestational diabetes, there are often no symptoms. Or you might notice: By itself, pregnancy can make you pee more often and feel hungrier, so these symptoms donât always mean you have gestational diabetes. But it's important to get tested to avoid problems for both you and your baby. If you're having symptoms, you should be tested for the disease. Your doctor may also suggest screening if you're at higher risk. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends you get screened if you're between 35 and 70 years old and have overweight or obesity. Diabetes is diagnosedby measuring the amount of glucose in your blood. You'll typically need to have high levels on two separate days to get a diagnosis. If you have the disease, measuring your blood sugar is important for keeping it under control. There are several kinds of tests used. A1c test (glycated hemoglobin) This test measures the average of your blood sugar levels over 2-3 months. A result of 6.5% or higher means you have diabetes. A level between 5.7% and 6.4% is considered prediabetes. You'll be retested regularly to see whether your treatment plan is working. Fasting blood sugar test For this test, you won't be able to eat or drink anything but water for 8 hours before you have your blood drawn. A result of 126 mg/dL or more indicates diabetes. Between 100 mg/dL and 125 mg/dL is prediabetes. Random blood sugar test This test can be done at any time, whether you've eaten or not. You may get it if you're havingsymptoms of diabetesand doctors think it would be dangerous to wait for a fasting test. With this test, 200 mg/dL is considered too high. Glucose tolerance test This test takes place over 2 hours, and you'll also have to fast for 8 hours first. Your blood is drawn, and then you drink a very sweet liquid. Your blood is drawn again at 1 hour and 2 hours, and the three results are compared to see how your body manages the sugar. A result above 200 mg/dL at 2 hours means you have diabetes. A level between 140 mg/dL and 199 mg/dL is prediabetes. A different version of this test that doesn't require you to fast can be used to screen for gestational diabetes. If the result is high, you'll get a more extensive test. Autoantibody test This blood test doesn't measure your blood sugar, but it looks for certain immune system proteins that indicate you have type 1 rather than type 2 diabetes. You might get it if a blood sugar test is high, or if you have a parent or sibling with the disease. Urine ketone test When you have diabetes, you may need to test your urine for ketones from time to time. These are substances your body makes when it has to use fat rather than glucose for fuel. This can happen when you're low on insulin. Ketones in your urine are a sign of a dangerous condition called ketoacidosis, which needs immediate treatment. To take the test, you pee in a cup and dip a strip of a special paper into it. The paper changes color to show the level of ketones. There's no cure for diabetes, but it can be managed and controlled. The goals of managing diabetes are to: Treatment depends on what type of diabetes you have. It often includes a combination of medications, diet strategies, and lifestyle changes. An important part of treatment is keeping track of your blood sugar levels. People with type 1 and some people with type 2 diabetes need to test themselves several times a day to make sure their level stays within their target range and take action if it's too high or too low. This might be done by pricking your finger to get a small drop of blood or wearing a monitor that constantly measures your blood sugar through your skin. People with prediabetes and some people with type 2 diabetes only need their blood tested during checkups, which may be once or several times a year. Diabetes medications You may take medication several times a day, or on a daily or weekly schedule. Insulin.People with type 1 diabetes and some people with type 2 use insulin to allow their cells to absorb glucose. You inject this medication under your skin with a needle and syringe or a special pen. Your doctor will tell you when and how often to take insulin, but it's usually before meals. You could also wear a pump that delivers a steady dose throughout the day. Insulin is safe to take if you have gestational diabetes. Oral medications.Many people with type 2 diabetes take medication in pill form once or twice a day. You may take a combination of more than one type. These are among the most common: Other medications you take by mouth work with your digestion, slowing the breakdown of starches so your blood sugar stays steady. GLP-1 and GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists.Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide are naturally occurring hormones that tell your body to release insulin, slow the rate at which food moves out of your stomach, and send signals to your brain that make you feel full. These drugs mimic the action of those hormones, which helps lower your blood sugar. One medication comes as a pill, while the others you inject under your skin either once a week or once or twice a day. The FDA-approved GLP-1 receptor agonists for type 2 diabetes are: Tirzepatide is the only approved dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist. Other medications.To help prevent some of the complications that can come from from diabetes, your doctor may also prescribe blood pressure or cholesterol medications, or low-dose aspirin. Diabetes and diet What and when you eat plays an important part in controlling your blood glucose levels. Certain foods, such as sweets, soft drinks, and refined grains like white bread, are digested very quickly and cause your blood sugar to spike. Skipping a meal can make your blood sugar drop too low. When you have type 1 diabetes, you need to understand how the things you eat and drink affect your blood sugar, so you can be sure to get the right amount of insulin to stay in your target range. Your doctor will teach you to track nutrients, especially carbohydrates, and adjust your insulin doses. For everyone with diabetes or prediabetes, following a healthy diet can help you control your blood sugar, cholesterol, blood pressure, and weight. That includes: Things to limit or avoid include: Diabetes and exercise Physical activity helps your body use insulin better, which lowers your blood sugar. It can also help you keep your blood pressure and cholesterol down and manage your weight. Doctors recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise 5 days every week, plus 2 days of strength training. That can be walking at a brisk pace, swimming, or even dancing. Pick something you enjoy and will stick with, and check with your doctor before you start an exercise program. If you have type 1 diabetes, you may need to change your insulin dose or eat more carbs when you exercise so your blood sugar doesn't drop too low. Diabetes home remedies You hold the key to managing your diabetes. Take these steps to help control your blood sugar and prevent complications: Remember: What you do at home every day affects your blood sugar more than what your doctor can do every few months during your checkups. While you can't prevent type 1 diabetes, you can make lifestyle changes that will lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Ask your doctor if medications such asmetforminor weight loss drugs might be helpful. Diabetes is a disease in which your body has problems either making or using insulin. That leads to too much glucose (sugar) in your blood, which can cause serious health problems. You can lower your risk for the most common type, type 2 diabetes, by losing weight, being physically active, and following a healthy eating plan. Ask your doctor if you should have a screening blood sugar test. Can diabetes be reversed? People with type 2 diabetes can lower their blood sugar to levels that are no longer in the range of diabetes. Doctors call this remission. It's usually accomplished by losing weight. But type 2 diabetes can come back. Type 1 diabetes can't be reversed. If I have type 2 diabetes and take insulin, do I have to take it forever? Not necessarily. For some people, insulin is a short-term treatment to quickly lower your blood sugar. If diet, exercise, weight loss, and other medications bring your blood glucose levels under control, you may be able to stop taking insulin. Do sugary drinks cause diabetes? Not directly, but a study published in 2019 found an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes for people who drank 4 ounces of sugar-sweetened drinks, including soft drinks and juice, every day. Sugar from any source raises your blood sugar level. Over time, blood sugar that's too high makes your body less sensitive to insulin. How can I flush sugar out of my system fast? Taking fast-acting insulin, drinking water, and exercising can help lower your blood sugar quickly. But exercise is dangerous if you have ketoacidosis, so test your urine for ketones first if your blood sugar level is high. Call your doctor to find out if you need emergency treatment.

Diabetes mellitus, also called diabetes, is a term for several conditions involving how your body turns food into energy. The term comes from the Greek word âdiabetes,â which means to siphon or to pass through, and the Latin word âmellitus,â which means sweet. In 2021, 529 million people worldwide and 38.4 million in the U.S. had diabetes.Â When you eat a carbohydrate, your body turns it into a sugar called glucose and sends that to your bloodstream. Your pancreas releases insulin, a hormone that helps move glucose from your blood into your cells, which use it for energy. When you have diabetes and donât get treatment, your body doesnât use insulin like it should. Too much glucose stays in your blood, a condition usually calledhigh blood sugar. This can cause health problems that may be serious or even life-threatening. Thereâs no cure for diabetes. But with treatment and lifestyle changes, you can live a long, healthy life. Diabetes comes in different forms, depending on the cause. Prediabetes is when your blood sugar is higher than it should be but not high enough for your doctor to diagnose it as diabetes. Normal blood sugar levels are between 70 mg/dL and 99 mg/dL. Blood sugar levels in people with prediabetes are between 110 mg/dL and 125 mg/dL. Prediabetes often has no symptoms. More than a third of people in the U.S. have it, but about 90% don't know. If you have prediabetes, you might notice darkened skin on areas like your neck, armpits, and groin. Rarely, you may have other symptoms like: Over 70% of people with prediabetes later developtype 2 diabetes. Youâre also likely to start having heart, kidney, and nerve damage.Â You can lower these risks and potentially reverseprediabetesby:Â Your doctor might recommend medications like acarbose andmetforminif you canât follow these lifestyle changes or youâre at a very high risk of having type 2 diabetes.Â Type 1 diabetes is also called insulin-dependent diabetes. It used to be called juvenile-onset diabetes because it was thought to start more often in childhood. However, more research has shown it happens as frequently in children and adults.Â Type 1 diabetes is an organ-specific autoimmune condition. It happens when your body attacks your pancreas with antibodies. The organ is damaged and doesn't make insulin. It affects 2 million people, including about 304,000 children and teens in the U.S. Your genes might cause this type of diabetes. It could also happen because of problems with cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented.Â Type 1diabetes symptomshappen quickly, in a few days to weeks. They include: About 30% of people with type 1 diabetes have a life-threatening condition that causes loss of consciousness, called diabetic coma, as their first symptom.Â Get medical help immediately if you or your child show any of these symptoms: Many of the health problems that can come with type 1 happen because of damage to tiny blood vessels in your eyes (diabetic retinopathy), nerves (diabetic neuropathy), and kidneys (diabetic nephropathy). People with type 1 also have a higher risk of heart disease and stroke. A doctor may use a test called random plasma glucose (RPG) to check how much sugar you have in your blood when diagnosing type 1 diabetes. They may also use an A1c blood test to estimate your blood sugar levels over the last 3 months. Your doctor uses it to see how well your blood sugar is controlled. That helps them know your risk of complications. Treatment for type 1 diabetes involves injecting insulin into the fatty tissue just under your skin. You might use: If you have type 1 diabetes, youâll need to make changes, including: Type 2 diabetesÂ used to be called non-insulin-dependent or adult-onset diabetes. But itâs become more common in children and teens over the past 20 years, largely because more young people are overweight or obese. About 90% of people with diabetes have type 2. When you have type 2 diabetes, your pancreas usually creates some insulin. But either itâs not enough or your body doesnât use it like it should.ÂInsulin resistance, when your cells donât respond to insulin, usually happens in fat, liver, and muscle cells. Type 2 diabetes is often milder than type 1. But it can still cause major health complications, especially in the tiny blood vessels in your kidneys, nerves, and eyes. Type 2 also raises your risk ofÂ heart diseaseÂ andÂ stroke. People who have obesity -- more than 20% over their target body weight for their height -- have an especially high risk of type 2 diabetes and the health problems that can follow. Obesity often causesÂ insulin resistance, so your pancreas has to work harder to make more insulin. But itâs still not enough to keep your blood sugar levels where they should be. Treatment for type 2 diabetesinvolves keeping a healthy weight, eating right, and exercising. Some people need medication, too. Your doctor might do an A1c test a few times a year to see how well youâve been controlling your blood sugar. Pregnancy usually causes some form of insulin resistance. If this becomes diabetes, itâs called gestational. Doctors often spot it in 2%-10% of pregnancies. You may be diagnosed in the middle or late pregnancy with a:Â It usually causes no or mild symptoms like feeling thirstier or peeing more often. It goes away after giving birth. But people who have had gestational diabetes are 8-10 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes and have twice the risk of developing heart disease compared to those who have not had it.Â Â If youâve had gestational diabetes, youâll need to be tested for type 2 diabetes every 3 years for the rest of your life. If you get gestational diabetes while pregnant, your symptoms should go away once you have your baby. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Gestational diabetesis more of a risk for thebabythan the mother. Because your blood sugars travel through their placenta to the baby, itâs important to control gestational diabetes to protect the baby's growth and development.Â A baby might have unusual weight gain before birth, trouble breathing at birth, or a higher risk of obesity and diabetes later in life. You might need a cesarean section because of an overly large baby, or they might have damage to their heart, kidney, nerves, and eyes. Gestational diabetes treatment involves: Rarely, diabetes can happen due to changes in a single gene that can affect how much insulin the body can produce. When this is the case, it is called monogenic diabetes.Â The gene mutation is often passed down from one or both parents. However, gene mutations may also happen unexpectedly.Â In the U.S., monogenic diabetes happens in 1% to 4% of all diabetes cases.Â The two main types of monogenic diabetes are Many times, doctors mistake monogenic diabetes for type 2 diabetes. But a doctor might suspect monogenic diabetes if:Â Then, they recommend genetic testing to confirm it and determine which specific type you have. They might also test your family members to see if they have it. You may get diabetes medicines you take by mouth or insulin injections to treat it. Secondary diabetes is a type of diabetes that happens because of another primary condition, which may include: Medications like steroids may also trigger secondary diabetes.Â Treatment may involve managing the underlying cause, making lifestyle changes, and taking insulin and other medications to control yourblood sugar levels. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the most common types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes affects 1.3 million people in the U.S., and type 2 diabetes occurs in 37 million people.Â Type 1 diabetes happens when the immune system mistakenly attacks your pancreas, causing it to stop producing insulin. Both genetic and environmental factors play a role in causing this immune response.Â Type 2 diabetes is a hormonal condition that happens when your body doesn't respond well to insulin, which leads to high blood sugar levels. With time, the pancreas in people with type 2 diabetes may stop working as well as it should until it stops being able to produce insulin. Type 1 diabetes symptoms usually happen suddenly within a few days to a week. Type 2 diabetes symptoms take a while, about a year, to develop. People with type 1 diabetes need insulin medicine because the body canât make it anymore. People with type 2 diabetes only need insulin when their pancreas stops making it.Â Diabetes is a group of conditions that affect how well your body turns food into energy. It causes high blood sugar levels that can lead to serious health issues like heart disease, eye damage,dementia, stroke, and kidney damage. Your doctor will manage it depending on the type you have. You may need insulin injections and antidiabetic medicines. Theyâll also recommend following lifestyle changes like eating a healthy diet and exercising.Â Â Is type 2 diabetes manageable? Yes, type 2 diabetes is manageable with medicines and healthy lifestyle changes. What causes diabetes mellitus? What causes diabetes will depend on the type. It may be related to your genes, lifestyle, and family history. But all forms of diabetes cause you to have high blood sugar levels. What are diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2? Types 1 and 2 diabetes are the most common type of diabetes.Type 1 diabeteshappens when your immune system attacks and damages your pancreas, causing it to stop making enough insulin. Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body stops using insulin well.

Diabetes insipidusÂ is a rare condition that makes you have an intense thirst andÂ causes your body to make a lot ofÂ colorless, odorless urine. Most people pee out 1 to 2 quarts a day, but people with diabetes insipidus can pee between 3 and 20 quarts a day. The main types of diabetes insipidus include central, nephrogenic, and pregnancy-related. Central diabetes insipidus You get this type when damage to your hypothalamus or pituitary gland affects how your body makes or releases a hormone called vasopressin. Vasopressin tells yourÂ kidneysÂ to hold on toÂ water, which makes your urine more concentrated. (Vasopressin is also called antidiureticÂ hormone or ADH.) If you have central diabetes insipidus, your kidneys remove too much fluid from your body, and you pee more. This damage can result from: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus You get this when your kidneys donât respond to vasopressin and take too much fluid from your bloodstream. Doctors donât always know why it happens, but some causes include: Gestational diabetesÂ insipidus This is very rare. You get this type only during pregnancy. Sometimes, yourÂ placentaÂ -- the organ that gives oxygen and nutrients to yourbaby-- makes an enzyme that breaks down vasopressin. Other pregnant people make more prostaglandin, a hormone-like chemical that makes their kidneys less sensitive to vasopressin. Most cases of gestational diabetes insipidus are mild and donât cause clear symptoms. The condition usually goes away after birth, but it might come back in anotherÂ pregnancy. Symptoms include: With dehydration, you might notice: Does diabetes insipidus cause weight loss? Diabetes insipidus can cause weight loss, especially in infants and children. Severe thirst, a main symptom of this condition, can get in the way of a normal appetite. This means people with diabetes insipidus may eat less and not have the best nutrition, leading to weight loss in adults and slow growth in children. Many of the symptoms are similar in younger people. In infants, watch for: In children, signs include: Your body makes a hormone called vasopressin in a part ofÂ your brainÂ called theÂhypothalamus. Vasopressin is stored in your pituitary gland. When youâre thirsty or a little dehydrated, your vasopressin levels go up. Your kidneys absorb moreÂ waterÂ and put out concentrated urine. If youâve had enough to drink, vasopressin levels fall, and what comes out is clear and diluted. Some medicines, health conditions, and even your genetics can make you more likely to develop diabetes insipidus. (Photo Credit: DigitalVision/Getty Images) When your body doesnât make enough vasopressin, the condition is calledÂ central diabetes insipidus. Anyone can get this condition, but it's not common. Only about 1 in every 25,000 people get it. If you make enough vasopressin, but your kidneys donât respond to it the way they should, you haveÂnephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In either form, the result is the same. Your kidneys can't keep water, so they release a lot of pale urine even if youâre dehydrated. Factors that raise your chances of having diabetes insipidus are: Your doctor will do a physical exam. A checkup may not show any signs of central diabetes insipidus DI, except maybe an enlarged bladder or symptoms of dehydration. Theyâll ask questions about your health history, including your familyâs health. You might get a series of tests that include: Diabetes insipidus vs. SIADH Diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) are conditions that cause trouble with your bodyâs water balance in different ways. Diabetes insipidus causes your body to let go of too much water, which means lots of trips to the bathroom. SIADH, on the other hand, causes your body to retain too much fluid. This extra fluid waters down your blood, causing electrolyte imbalances.Â Electrolytes are minerals in your body with a tiny electric charge. Sodium is an important electrolyte in your blood, and SIADH can lead to hyponatremia or low sodium levels. Diabetes insipidus vs. diabetes mellitus Despite having similar names, diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus are two different diseases. The only things they have in common are that they make you thirsty and make you pee a lot. These conditions are caused by problems with different hormones. If you have diabetes insipidus, the hormones that help your body balance liquidsÂ (vasopressin or ADH)Â donât work. Only one in every 25,000 people gets this condition. With diabetes mellitus (often shortened to âdiabetesâ), your body canât use energy from food like it should. This is because thereâs a problem with how your body makes or uses the insulin hormone. Itâs far more common than diabetes insipidus. As of 2021, around 38.4 million Americans have type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes insipidus that isnât under control can make you more likely to have complications such as: How does diabetes insipidus affect pregnancy? Gestational diabetes insipidusis a rare condition and symptoms usually donât show up until the end of the second or third trimester. It might be tricky for your doctor to diagnose this condition because the main symptoms, extreme thirst and peeing a lot, are typical symptoms of late pregnancy. But in this case, these symptoms get worse over a few days or weeks. Without treatment, you might lose weight and feel extremely tired and nauseous. Your doctor will test your urine to see if you have this disorder, and if you do, youâll be treated with medication. If you have gestational diabetes insipidus, you might be at risk of liver problems, so your doctor will monitor your liver closely. First, your doctor will tell you to drink plenty of fluids. That will replace the constant loss of water. Other treatments depend on which type you have: Central diabetes insipidus.Â Youâll take medications suchÂ asdesmopressinÂ (DDAVP).Â Desmopressin controls urine output, maintains fluid balance, and prevents dehydration. You take it two or three times a day. It usually comes as a nasal spray, tablet, or injection. There are also treatments to help these drugs work better. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidusÂ can be harder to treat. If itâs caused by a drug, stopping the medicine helps. Other medicines may ease symptoms. These includeÂ indomethacinÂ (Indocin) and diuretics suchÂ as amilorideÂ (Moduretic 5-50) orÂ hydrochlorothiazideÂ (Microzide). Though diuretics typically make you pee more, in this case, they help you make less urine. Sometimes, this condition goes away if you treat the cause. Gestational diabetes insipidus.Â You can take desmopressin while youâre pregnant. Your problems should go away after you have theÂ baby. Is diabetes insipidus curable? No. But the good news is that the condition is treatable. Whatâs more, certain types of diabetes insipidus are transient, which means the condition goes away on its own. There are steps you can take to manage your symptoms and avoid complications. To stay healthy while living with diabetes insipidus, itâs important to: Diabetes insipidus doesnât cause kidney failure or lead toÂdialysis. Your kidneys still do their main job, which is to filter your blood. But you will be more prone to dehydration. Make sure you always have something to drink close by, especially when itâs hot or when youÂ exercise.Â Carry your medication with you, and avoid situations where you can't get water. It's also a good idea to wear "medic alert" jewelry or keep a note with you about your condition so that health care workers know about it. Diabetes insipidus is a condition that makes you very thirsty and causes you to pee a lot. It happens when your body doesn't produce enough of a hormone (vasopressin/ADH) that helps balance water or when your kidneys don't respond to this hormone. To manage it, drink plenty of water, take your prescribed medications, and keep an eye on your symptoms. Regular visits to your doctor are important to keep the condition under control. Is diabetes insipidus a serious disease? Diabetes insipidus is a serious disease that can be well managed with the right care. This includes avoiding dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids, taking your medication as prescribed, and regular visits to your doctor. What deficiency causes diabetes insipidus? A deficiency of theÂ vasopressinÂ hormone, also called antidiuretic hormone or ADH, causes diabetes insipidus. What are type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus? Type 1 andtype 2 diabetesare caused by problems with how your body makes and uses the insulin hormone. Insulin is needed to change food into energy your body can use. Without enough insulin, youâll have too much glucose, or sugar, in your blood which can make you really sick.Â If you have type 1 diabetes, your immune system attacks the cells that make insulin. Type 2 diabetes, the most common type, happens when your body doesnât make enough insulin or your body doesnât respond to it the right way, also called insulin resistance.

Most commonly known as gestational DI, gestagenic diabetes insipidus is a rare disorder that happens in pregnancy, usually in the third trimester. This condition can make you so thirsty you drink many glasses of water a day. As a result, you might go to the bathroom more than once or twice an hour. This isnât a result of pregnancy but ofdiabetes insipidus, which is sometimes called "water" diabetes. It has symptoms like other forms of the disease but isnât related. It's rare, but sometimes during pregnancy, the placenta can make an enzyme that destroys vasopressin, a hormone that controls how much water you retain. The lack of it causes heavy thirst andfrequent urination. Gestagenic DI can also lead to a lack of control when you pee and to bedwetting. In some cases, the disease runs in the family. In others, it's a problem with the way your body controls thirst. And sometimes the cause isnât known. Most pregnant women make many trips to the bathroom at night due to the pressure the growingbabyputs on the bladder. But if you go a lot and have an intense thirst, it could be gestagenic diabetes. Other symptoms includenausea, dizziness, and weakness. Your doctor will test your urine to see if itâs light and diluted or concentrated and yellow. TheyÂ may also send your blood out for lab tests. The doctor may opt not to treat gestagenic DI. If thatâs the case, theyâll likely ask you to come to the office a lot. Theyâll make sure your body doesnât retain too much fluid. You'll also need to keep liquids with you so you don't get dehydrated. You may need to take desmopressin, a man-made form of vasopressin. It usually comes as a nasal spray. This treatment helps control urine. It also stops bedwetting by letting your body to absorb and manage water from your kidneys. If your body's thirst control is the cause of gestational DI, your doctor will prescribe other treatments. See your doctor if youâre pregnant and have all of these symptoms: Most cases go away within 4 to 6 weeks after you give birth. But it may return with future pregnancies.

Diabetes happens when your blood sugar (blood glucose), which is your body's primary energy source, is too high. There are two types of diabetes: Extreme thirst is one of the most common early symptoms of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) Bothtypes of diabeteshave some of the same telltale warning signs. Increased hunger Your body converts the food you eat into glucose, which your cells use for energy. But your cells need insulin to take in glucose. If your body doesn't make enough or any insulin, or if your cells resist the insulin your body makes, the glucose can't get into them and you have no energy. This can make you hungrier than usual. Fatigue and tiredness A lack of insulin and glucose can also make you more tired than usual. Peeing more often The average person usually has to pee about four to seven times in 24 hours, but people with diabetes may go a lot more. Why? Normally, your body reabsorbs glucose as it passes through your kidneys. But when diabetes pushes yourblood sugarup, your kidneys may not be able to bring it all back in. This causes the body to make more urine, and that takes fluids. The result: You'll have to go more often. You might pee out more, too. Frequent thirst Because you're peeing so much, you can get very thirsty. Dry mouth Because your body is using fluids to make pee, there's less moisture for other things. You could get dehydrated, and your mouth may feel dry. Itchy and dry skin Your skin could also feel dry, which may start to itch as well. Blurred vision Changing fluid levels in your body could cause the lenses in your eyes to swell. They would then change shape and be unable to focus. Unintentional weight loss If your body can't get energy from your food, it will start burning muscle and fat for energy instead. You may lose weight even though you haven't changed how you eat. Can diabetes cause headaches? Headache may be a symptom ofhypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. It happens when your sugar or glucose level drops very low. How can you tell if you have diabetes? Most early symptoms are due to higher-than-normal glucose levels in your blood. While symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the same, there's a difference in how they appear. Intype 1 diabetes, symptoms show up quickly, in just a few days or weeks, especially in children. The four most common symptoms are: Type 2diabetes symptomsmay be mild and develop more slowly, especially early on in the disease. It's possible to go for years without realizing you have the condition. There's no major difference in early diabetes signs between men and women, but there may be a few contrasts. Women with the condition may have vaginal yeast infections and urinary tract infections more often, while men with untreated diabetes tend to lose muscle mass. Early symptoms of type 1 diabetes in children Type 1 diabetes can happen at any age but tends to crop up in children aged 5 to 6 and 11 to 13. Researchers think this is due to hormones at these ages. Symptoms include: Early symptoms of type 2 diabetes in children Adults are more likely to get type 2 diabetes, but the disease is happening more often in kids because of obesity. Your child may not show any symptoms of the disease, but here are some to look out for: High blood sugar duringpregnancyusually has no symptoms. You might feel a little thirstier than normal, have to pee more often, have a dry mouth, or feel tired. If you have an average chance of gettinggestational diabetes, your doctor will likely screen you for the condition between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. But your doctor may test you early in your pregnancy, possibly at your first prenatal visit, if: The screening involves drinking a sugary solution and having your blood sugar tested an hour later. If your blood sugar is high, you'll need a follow-up test, where you'll drink a stronger solution and have yourblood sugar testedevery hour for 3 hours. Signs of type 2 diabetes complications may include: Learn about what you can do to lower your risk of diabetes complications. If you're older than 45 or have other risks for diabetes, it's important to get tested. When you spot the condition early, you can avoid nerve damage,hearttrouble, and other complications. As a general rule, call your doctor if you: Diabetes often starts with mild symptoms such as feeling very hungry and tired, needing to pee a lot, being very thirsty, having a dry mouth, itchy skin, and blurry vision. Type 1 diabetes symptoms appear quickly and are more severe, whiletype 2 symptomsdevelop slowly. It's important to see a doctor if you have symptoms or have a higher chance of getting diabetes to avoid serious health problems.

The following tests are used to diagnose diabetes: Ahemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testcan be done without fasting and can be used to diagnose or confirm either prediabetes or diabetes. If you get a positive test result, meaning you have diabetes or prediabetes, your doctor will confirm this by repeating the fasting plasma glucose test or theoral glucose tolerance teston a different day.Â Another test, thezinctransporter 8 autoantibody test, can help determine if a person has type 1 diabetes and not another type. This test is most reliable when done in the morning. The results and their meaning are shown in Table 1. If your fasting glucose level is 100 to 125 mg/dL, you have a form of prediabetes called impaired fasting glucose (IFG), meaning that you're more likely to develop type 2 diabetes but don't have it yet. A level of 126 mg/dL or above, confirmed by repeating the test on another day, means you have diabetes. Table 1. Fasting Plasma Glucose Test *Confirmed by repeating the test on a different day. Research has shown that the OGTT is more sensitive than the FPG test for diagnosing prediabetes, but it is less convenient to give. The OGTT requires you to fast for at least 8 hours before the test. Your plasma glucose is measured immediately before and 2 hours after you drink a liquid containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. Results and what they mean are shown in Table 2. If your blood sugar level is between 140 and 199 mg/dL 2 hours after drinking the liquid, you have a form of prediabetes called impaired glucose tolerance or IGT, meaning that you're more likely to developtype 2 diabetesbut don't have it yet. A 2-hour glucose level of 200 mg/dL or above, confirmed by repeating the test on another day, means that you have diabetes. Table 2. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test *Confirmed by repeating the test on a different day. Gestational diabetes is also diagnosed with the OGTT. Blood sugar levels are checked four times during the test. If yourblood sugar levelsare above normal at least twice during the test, you have gestational diabetes. Table 3 shows the above-normal results for the OGTT forgestational diabetes. Table 3. Gestational Diabetes: Above-Normal Results for the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test Note: Some laboratories use other numbers for this test. Glucose challenge test This test, also called the 1-hour glucose tolerance test, is a shorter version of the OGTT. This shorter test can better predict type 2 diabetes than other types of tests.Â Â If your blood glucose reading 1 hour after drinking the 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water is at or above 155 mg/dL, youâre considered to have intermediate hyperglycemia. If your blood glucose levels are greater than or equal to 209 mg/dL, you have type 2 diabetes.Â A random blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or more, plus presence of the following symptoms, can mean that you have diabetes: Other symptoms include fatigue, blurred vision, increasedhunger, and sores that don't heal. Your doctor will check your blood glucose level on another day using the FPG or the OGTT to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. Â This test tells you what percentage of your hemoglobin (the protein in your blood that carries oxygen) is coated with glucose. Your doctor gives you this test by using a needle to collect a sample of blood from your arm. The blood sample goes to a lab for results. YourHbA1creading gives your doctor a snapshot of your blood glucose control over several months. An HbA1c of 5.7% to 6.4% points to prediabetes and marks a time when it can be reversed by lifestyle changes. An HbA1c of 6.5% or higher is considered diabetes. Table 4. HbA1c Test HbA1c Diagnosis Below 5.7% Normal Between 5.7% and 6.4% Prediabetes 6.5% or higher Diabetes Â HbA1c tests donât diagnose type 1 or gestational diabetes, only type 2 diabetes.Â As your doctor collects data to confirm a diabetes diagnosis, these are the values they follow as a guideline: Table 5. Diagnostic Criteria for Prediabetes Test Result HbA1c 5.7-6.4% Fasting blood glucose 100-125 mg/dL 2-hour OGTT blood glucose 140-199 mg/dL Table 6. Diagnostic Criteria for Diabetes Test Result HbA1c 6.5% or higher Fasting blood glucose 126 mg/dL or higher 2-hour OGTT blood glucose 200 mg/dL or higher If your doctor confirms adiabetes diagnosis, they may want to do further tests to decide if you haveÂ type 1 diabetes. This is especially important for children and people who donât have other risk factors for diabetes who get a diabetes diagnosis.Â Autoantibody test.Your doctor may suggest a zinc transporter 8 autoantibody (ZnT8Ab) test. The goal of having thisÂ blood test is to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis that can lead to timely treatment. C-peptide test (Insulin in blood test).ÂThis test helps measure how muchinsulinyour pancreas is making. Your pancreas releases equal amounts of insulin and C-peptide into your bloodstream at the same time. C-peptide doesn't affect your blood glucose levels, but it stays in your blood longer than insulin. Your doctor will take a small sample of blood and send it to a lab for this test.Â Ketones.Â Your doctor can test your urine using a paper test strip to look for ketones. Ketones are acids your body makes when itâs usingfatinstead of glucose for energy. This can be a sign oftype 1 diabetes. There are many tests that confirm a diabetes diagnosis, including a fasting plasma glucose test, oral glucose tolerance test, random plasma glucose test, and hemoglobin A1c test. These tests tell your doctor if you have diabetes or are at risk of developing it (prediabetes). How do you diagnose diabetes?Your doctor can diagnose diabetes with blood tests. They may want to do more than one type to be sure of the diagnosis. If your doctor thinks you may have type 1 diabetes, they may do further tests on your blood to look for autoantibodies or look at your urine forketones.Â How do I accept a diabetes diagnosis?Learning you have diabetes can make you feel a range of emotions. Know that over 38 million Americans live with diabetes. There are many organizations and support groups to help with emotional health, diet management, and lifestyle tips to help you live well with diabetes.Â What should you do when first diagnosed with diabetes?Educate yourself on your condition so you feel empowered to take good care of yourself. Write down any questions you have and bring them with you to your doctor so you continue to understand more. Reach out to other people already living with diabetes for advice and support. Follow your treatment plan as your doctor directs.Â Â What do you say to a newly diagnosed diabetic person?If someone in your life gets a diabetes diagnosis, ask them how you can help them process the news. Be a good listener. Learn about diabetes yourself so you can be a helpful partner in conversation or in day-to-day life as they learn to manage it. Support from friends and family can help people with diabetes manage their condition better.Â How does a doctor diagnose diabetes type 1?After a diabetes diagnosis, there are further tests your doctor can use to see if you have type 1 diabetes.Â These include tests on your blood to look for autoantibodies, tests to see how much insulin your pancreas is making, or urine tests that look for ketones.Â SOURCES:Â American Diabetes Association:Â âDiabetes Diagnosis and Tests,â âNewly Diagnosed with Diabetes.âÂ National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.Â Medscape: âIs a 1-Hour Glucose Test Better at Predicting T2D Risk?â MedlinePlus: âHemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) Test,â âInsulin in Blood.â Mayo Clinic: âType 1 Diabetes.â CDC: âTesting for Diabetes,â âHelping Friends and Family With Diabetes.â Diabetes UK: âCoping with a Diabetes Diagnosis.â Â© 2005 - 2025 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

An oral glucose tolerance test checks how well your body processes sugar. If the test finds your level is too high, that's a sign your cells aren't absorbing sugar the way they should be.Â Yourblood sugar levelcan give your doctor important clues about your health. The test can tell your doctor whether you're at risk of having diabetes or if you already have it. A shorter version of an OGTT checks for diabetes during pregnancy, which is called gestational diabetes. Normally when you eat, your blood sugar rises. Your pancreas, a long gland deep in the belly, releases a hormone called insulin. It helps move sugar from your blood into your cells for energy and storage. Then your blood sugar goes back down to normal. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body uses insulin poorly. Glucose builds up in your blood. This excess sugar can damage blood vessels around your body. Diabetes can lead to heart disease, nerve damage, eye disease, and kidney damage. For an oral glucose tolerance test, blood is drawn both before and after you drink a concentrated sugar solution. Comparing the blood samples will tell your doctor how well you process sugar. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) You might need an oral glucose tolerance test if you: Â If you're pregnant, you'll probably have a shorter version of the oral glucose tolerance test between your 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy. The shorter version, which takes only an hour, is called a glucose challenge test. Your doctor might want you to take the test earlier in your pregnancy if your risk of gestational diabetes is elevated. Risk factors include:Â If your doctor is concerned about your risk, or if you show an elevated level on the glucose challenge test, your doctor probably will have you take another version of the test. In the days leading up to the test, eat the way you normally do.Â You shouldn't eat anything for 8 hours before the test. You may want to schedule it first thing in the morning, so that you can fast overnight. You shouldn't drink anything except water during that 8 hours. When you schedule the test, talk to your doctor about any medications you take. Â Â You'll get the OGTT at your doctor's office, a clinic, hospital, or lab.Â The first step is taking a blood sample. This will establish what your fasting blood glucose level is.Â Then you'll drink a large glass of a sugary concoction. If the test is being done on a child, the amount they drink is adjusted to reflect their body weight.Â If the test is checking fortype 2 diabetes, you'll have blood drawn again 2 hours after you drink the liquid.Â If you're pregnant, you might have to do a longer version of the oral glucose tolerance test. Your doctor might order this because you're at high risk of getting gestational diabetes or because your reading on the 1-hour glucose challenge test caused concern.Â You'll also fast for 8 hours and have a blood sample taken to establish your fasting blood glucose level. Then you'll have blood samples taken 1, 2 and 3 hours after you drink the sugary solution.Â You'll probably have to wait at the doctor's office or lab for the entire test period.Â Once the test is done, you can go back to your normal routine right away.Â Â Â The OGTT has very few issues. Some people have minor side effects from the sugary drink or from the needle stick. Side effects from the drink include: Possible problems from the blood test include: Your blood glucose level should rise after you finish the sugary drink. Then it should go back to normal, as insulin moves glucose into your cells. If your blood sugar takes a long time to go back to normal, you could have diabetes. You might see a measurement from the test written out as âmg/dL.â It stands for milligrams per deciliter.Â Glucose tolerance test normal range The normal range for blood glucose is 139 mg/dL or lower.Â If your level is between 140 mg/dL and 199 mg/dL, that's a sign your glucose tolerance is impaired. This is also calledprediabetes. You're at risk of having type 2 diabetes. Your risk of heart disease is also elevated, even if you never have diabetes. If your blood glucose level is 200 mg/dL or higher, you may have diabetes. The normal range if you're not pregnant can be broken down further:Â A normal fasting level is 60 to 99 mg/dL.Â At the 1-hour mark, a normal level is less than 200 mg/Dl.Â Glucose challenge test normal range If you're pregnant and having the 1-hour glucose challenge test to check for gestational diabetes, a normal reading is below 140 mg/dL. If your blood glucose level after the 1-hour test is higher than 199 mg/dL, you have gestational diabetes.Â For the the 3-hour test to check for gestational diabetes, here are the ranges:Â If one of your results is higher than normal, your doctor will have you repeat the test in a few weeks. If you have two (or more) readings above normal, you have gestational diabetes. Â If you have prediabetes, your doctor will talk to you about ways to stop it from turning into a full-blown case. Exercise and weight loss are two ways to lower your risk of type 2 diabetes. If the test shows you have diabetes, you might get whatâs called anA1cor other tests to confirm the diagnosis. Diet, exercise, and medicine can help control your blood sugar. Good foods and physical activity can also help controldiabetes during pregnancy. Your blood sugar should go back to normal after your baby is born. But gestational diabetes increases your risk of getting type 2 diabetes after your pregnancy. You'll need to stay on a healthy diet and exercise plan to avoid a future diabetes diagnosis. An oral glucose tolerance test â also called OGTT â checks how your body processes sugar. Your results might show that you're at risk of getting type 2 diabetes, or that you already have it. If you're pregnant, you'll have your glucose tolerance tested to make sure you don't have gestational diabetes. For the test, you fast for 8 hours and then have blood drawn to establish yourfasting glucose level. Depending on the type of test you're taking, you'll have blood drawn again after 1 hour, 2 hours, or 3 hours. The risks of the tests are minimal, and you can go back to your normal routine right afterward.Â How many hours is OGTT fasting? Your last meal should be at least 8 hours before your test. You may want to schedule it first thing in the morning so that you fast overnight. You're allowed water, but no other liquids.Â How do I pass the OGTT? A normal blood glucose reading in this test is 139 mg/dL or lower.Â What's the difference between OGTT and GTT? The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is sometimes called a glucose tolerance test (GTT). The shorter, 1-hour version of the test is called the glucose challenge test.Â SOURCES: American Academy of Family Physicians: "Diabetes."

Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells. It carries oxygen around your body, delivering it to tissues. Hemoglobin also carries carbon dioxide to the lungs so you can breathe it out. Iron is a part of hemoglobin. It carries oxygen. If your iron is low, your body canât make hemoglobin or carry enough oxygen to your tissues. Hemoglobin is also the part of blood that gives it a red color.Â Hemoglobin structure Hemoglobin is made up of four protein chains called globins. Two of the globins are called alpha chains and two are called beta chains. Each globin has a compound with an iron molecule in the middle called a heme group. The iron molecule is what binds to oxygen to carry it through your body. What does hemoglobin do? Each heme group can hold one oxygen molecule, which means one hemoglobin molecule can hold four oxygen molecules. The alpha and beta chains of hemoglobin are arranged in a special way that helps each oxygen bind efficiently. Once one oxygen molecule binds to a heme group, the structureâs shape changes slightly so that the next oxygen molecule can attach more easily, and so on. The level of hemoglobin your body needs to function well depends on several factors including your age, race, sex, and general health. It can even vary based on where you live. For example, people who live at higher altitudes tend to have a higher range of hemoglobin levels than people who live at lower altitudes. Normal hemoglobin levels Hemoglobin is measured in grams per deciliter (gm/dL). Normal levels are different for men and women. The typical ranges are: Men: 14.0 to 17.5 gm/dL Women: 12.3 to 15.3 gm/dL Low hemoglobin Hemoglobin levels that fall below the normal range can be a sign of certain health conditions such as cancer oranemia. When your hemoglobin is low, your body canât get enough oxygen to its tissues, and it makes you feel tired and weak. Low hemoglobin levels may happen because: High hemoglobin If your hemoglobin levels are above normal, itâs usually because your body has had low oxygen levels over time (hypoxia). You might gethypoxiabecause of: High hemoglobin may make you have: To find out your hemoglobin levels, your doctor can give you a hemoglobin test. They do this by putting a needle into a vein and taking a sample of your blood. Sometimes, they can do the test with blood from a finger stick, or a heel stick in infants. They send the blood sample to a lab for testing. Often a hemoglobin test is part of a doctorâs routine physical exam. Acomplete blood count(CBC) is a series of tests on a blood sample that tells your doctor the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your body. Hemoglobin test at home You can buy kits that give you hemoglobin level results at home. You take the test by pricking your finger with a small injector. You collect the blood in a test tube which has a solution in it. Then, you shake the blood sample and solution together. You read the results by comparing the color of the sample to a color card after 2 minutes, which gives you a hemoglobin level estimate. If you have a low hemoglobin level, your doctor will want to find the underlying cause and treat it, if need be. One common way to raise hemoglobin is to increase the iron in your diet. Specifically, heme iron is a rich source of easily absorbed iron. Sources of heme iron include: Your body can absorb nonheme sources of iron more easily if you eat sources ofvitamin C(such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, kiwi, or broccoli) at the same time. Nonheme sources of iron include: Anything you cook in iron cookware will also absorb some iron and raise your levels slightly. The hemoglobin A1c test tells you your average level of blood sugar over the past 2-3 months. It's also called HbA1c, the glycated hemoglobin test, or glycohemoglobin. Itâs a lot like a baseball player's season batting average. A single game doesn't tell you how a player is performing in their career. Similarly, one day's test results don't give you the complete picture of how your treatment is working. Your A1c test results help your doctor determine whether you have diabetes. Itâs also used to diagnose prediabetes, in which your blood sugar level is higher than it should be but not high enough to qualify as diabetes. If your A1c levels are high enough to indicate either diabetes or prediabetes, but you donât have symptoms of either, your doctor may order another A1c test on a different day to confirm the diagnosis. People who have diabetes need this test regularly to see if their levels are staying within range. It can tell if you need to adjust your diabetes medicines. What is blood sugar (glucose)? Blood sugar, or blood glucose, provides energy to the cells in your body, allowing them to do their jobs. You get most of your blood sugar from the sugar, fiber, starches, and other carbohydrates in your diet. Your pancreas produces a hormone called insulin, which helps your cells absorb blood sugar to use for energy or to store for later. That process helps keep your blood sugar at a healthy level. But when you have diabetes, this process is disrupted, and without treatment, your blood sugar level remains high. An HbA1c test shows your blood sugar levels over the last few months. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) The sugar in your blood is called glucose. When glucose builds up in your blood, it binds to the hemoglobin in your red blood cells. The A1c test measuresÂ how much glucose is bound. Red blood cells live for about 3 months, so the test shows the average level of glucose in your blood for the past 3 months. If your glucose levels have been high over recent weeks, your hemoglobin A1c test result will be higher. The A1c test can be done in two ways. Letâs look at both. Blood draw from a vein: Blood draw from a finger prick: The A1c chart below shows how A1c levels compare with blood sugar levels. There are several reasons why you might need an A1c test, such as if you have symptoms ofdiabetes. These symptoms include: If you donât have these symptoms, you may get an A1c test to screen for diabetes as part of a routine doctorâs appointment, such as a physical. Several different factors help determine when you should first get your A1c tested and how often the test should be repeated. Keep in mind that different health organizations have different recommendations for when diabetes screening should begin. Letâs look at the CDC guidelines first. According to the CDC, you should get your A1c tested if: How often should you get an A1c test? Get tested every 3 years if your initial test results were normal but you are: If your initial results indicate prediabetes, get tested every 1-2 years or as often as your doctor recommends. Talk to your doctor about lifestyle changes you can make so that you donât go on to develop diabetes. If you test positive for prediabetes or diabetes but donât have symptoms, your doctor will test you again on a different day to confirm the results. Once your doctor confirms your diagnosis, youâll get an A1c test twice a year or more. Your testing schedule depends on different factors, such as changes made to your medications, other underlying health conditions, and how well-managed your diabetes is. For example, if you struggle to keep your blood sugar in the healthy range, you may need an A1c test four times a year. Some health organizations advise that you should start screening for diabetes earlier than age 45. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends the following: If your test results are normal, the ADA advises that the test should be repeated every 3 years. Your doctor may recommend screening more often if you have symptoms of diabetes or your risk of diabetes goes up (for example, if you gain weight). Diabetes screening may be done with an A1c test or another blood test that measures your blood sugar. Because the A1c does not require fasting, itâs considered more convenient than the others. Your doctor will decide which test is best for you. This oneâs easy. You donât need to do anything to prepare for your A1c test. Do I need to fast for an A1C test? No, the test doesn't require fasting beforehand, so youâre free to eat and drink normally. But if you have other blood tests scheduled at the same time, they may require special prep. Check with your doctor. For people without diabetes, the normal range for the HbA1c level is between 4% and 5.6%. If your levels are in the range of 5.7%-6.4%, it means you have prediabetes and a higher chance of getting diabetes. Levels of 6.5% or higher mean you have diabetes. Whatâs a dangerous level of A1C? If your A1c climbs above 9%, your risk of serious diabetes complications goes up. These complications include: The target A1c level for people with diabetes is usually less than 7%. The higher the hemoglobin A1c, the higher your riskÂ of having complications related to diabetes.Â Someone who has had untreated diabetes for a long time might have a level above 8%. If you have diabetes and your level is above your target, your doctor may change your treatment plan to get your level down. A combination of diet, exercise, and medication can help you get an optimal A1c level. If you do useinsulinor blood sugar-lowering drugs, your doctor will determine the best dose and schedule to manage your blood sugar level. However, changes to your diet and exercise habits may affect how much diabetes medication you need because both influence your blood sugar level. Here are some tips to help you eat well and exercise safely. Diet The foods you eat affect your blood sugar level, so you have to plan carefully. This involves: Moderating carbohydrates.Carbs are usually the leading culprit behind blood sugar boosts. Knowing exactly how much youâll consume helps manage your blood sugar level and, if you use insulin, it helps you calculate your dose. Knowing the proper portion size.Figure out the right portion for the foods you plan to eat, then measure them as precisely as you can. Eating balanced meals.Your plate should combine protein, carbs, and fat from healthy sources such as fruits, vegetables, and other foods that are good for you. Talk to your doctor or a diabetes dietitian about meal planning and how to coordinate your meals with your diabetes medications. Skipping sugary drinks.These provide no nutrition but spike your blood sugar. Avoid them except when you need to quickly recover from low blood sugar. Exercise Your body burns blood sugar for fuel when you work out, and regular exercise helpsinsulindo its job of managing the blood sugar in your body. Vigorous workouts provide the most benefits, but lighter physical activities, such as walking, gardening, and simply being on your feet rather than the couch, also help. Aim for at least 30 minutes a day on at least 5 days a week. Here are some tips: Get advice.Talk to your doctor before you start a new exercise program. Together, you can come up with a plan that will be both beneficial and safe. Set a schedule.Exercise impacts your blood sugar, so you should coordinate it with both your meal times and medication schedule. Your doctor can help you set an effective schedule as well as tell you what blood sugar level you should target. Check your levels.Exercise can lower your blood sugar, but it's crucial to prevent it from dropping too low. Check your blood sugar before, during, and after you exercise. This is particularly important if you are on insulin or any blood sugar-lowering drugs. You may need a small snack before you work out or while you exercise to prevent low blood sugar. Finally, know the signs oflow blood sugar: feeling shaky, weak, tired, hungry, lightheaded, irritable, anxious, or confused. You may need to alter your insulin or medication in order to account for the impact that exercise can have on your blood sugar level. Drink water.You need to stay hydrated while you are active to prevent a rise in your blood sugar level. How much can your A1c drop in 3 months? The answer to that question is different for everyone and depends on lots of factors. Making healthy changes to your diet and adding regular exercise to your routine are two major components of getting your A1c down â and keeping it down. A reasonable goal is to maintain your A1c between 7% and 8%. Some people can bring it down even further, to 6.5% or lower. Your doctor can help you decide the best goal for you to set. A lot of factors can throw off the accuracy of your A1c results. One of these is the type of hemoglobin you have. This is determined by your genes. Hemoglobin A is the most common type, but you may have another type â called a hemoglobin variant â if you are Hispanic or of West African or Southeast Asian descent. Having a hemoglobin variant may affect your test results. A blood test can be done to learn what type of hemoglobin you have. This is important to know so that the lab accurately analyzes your A1c. There are other factors as well that can make your A1c results appear lower or higher than they actually are. Falsely low results Some health conditions and other factors can cause your A1c test results to be lower than they actually are. They include: Falsely high results An artificially high A1c test result can be caused by any of the following factors: Your doctor probably will have you take the A1c test as soon as youâre diagnosed with diabetes. Youâll also have the test if your doctor thinks you may get diabetes. The test will set a baseline level so you can see how well youâre controlling your blood sugar. How often youâll need the test after that depends on several things, such as: Youâll probably get tested once a year if you have prediabetes, which means you have a strong chance of developing diabetes. You may get tested twice each year if you havetype 2 diabetes, you don't use insulin, and your blood sugar level is usually in your target range. You could get it three or four times each year if you havetype 1 diabetes. You may also need the test more often if your diabetes plan changes or if you start a new medicine. You donât have to go to your doctorâs office to take your A1c test. You can do it at home. For some people, such as those who live in rural areas far from a health care provider, at-home tests offer a welcome alternative to driving to the doctorâs office. Their use greatly expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic as telemedicine grew in popularity. Research does suggest, however, that at least some at-home A1c tests are not quite as accurate as the tests done in your doctorâs office. Ask your doctor which tests are the most reliable. Some at-home A1c tests, called rapid tests, will give you results within a few minutes, while others require you to mail your blood sample to a lab for analysis. Results for mail-in tests take at least a few days to become available. Below are some basic instructions so you know what to expect. Each test is going to be somewhat different from the others, so be sure to carefully read and follow the instructions that come with your kit. For rapid tests: For mail-in tests: Some mail-in kits collect blood on a card rather than in a tube. The instructions provided in your kit will walk you through the process. As with other blood tests, the A1c test presents no real risks. The spot where the blood was drawn may become tender or bruised, but this typically clears up quickly. The A1c test is a valuable tool for diagnosing and managing diabetes, but itâs not perfect. As detailed above, itâs not always accurate. Another limitation is that it does not tell you how your blood sugar level fluctuates throughout the day, week, or month. Such fluctuations are particularly common in type 1 diabetes. Because the test only gives an average blood sugar level over the previous 3 months, your result could be the same whether your blood sugar fluctuates a lot or stays steady. Why is that important? Your goal is to keep your blood sugar level in your desired range as much as possible. Your "time in range" numbers provide a better picture of how well you manage your diabetes day to day and week to week. The A1c was not designed to do that. For that, you need a continuous glucose monitor, which tracks your glucose level 24/7. The A1c test is a blood test that measures your blood sugar level over the previous 3 months. It plays an important part in diagnosing and managing diabetes. If you have diabetes, expect to take an A1c test at least twice a year. But keep in mind that some health conditions and other factors can affect its accuracy. You may need to use additional means, such as a continuous glucose monitor, to keep close track of your blood sugar level from day to day. What does a hemoglobin A1c test measure? This test measures your average blood sugar (aka blood glucose) level over the previous 3 months. It is used to diagnose and manage diabetes. What is a normal A1c range by age? A1c tests calculate the percentage of blood sugar in your bloodstream. The normal range, meaning you donât have diabetes, is below 5.7%. That normal range remains the same no matter your age. Does a high A1c level mean I have diabetes? Maybe. If you have no symptoms of diabetes when you take the test, your doctor will schedule a follow-up A1c test to confirm the result. Also, several health conditions and other factors can make the A1c test less accurate, potentially causing falsely high or falsely low results. Your doctor should consider these factors when evaluating your A1c test result. What happens if your hemoglobin is low?Â Low levels of hemoglobin keep your body from delivering enough oxygen to tissues. As a result, you feel tired and weak, and your body canât function like it should. What happens if your hemoglobin is high?Â High levels of hemoglobin thicken your blood. This keeps it from flowing as easily, which means your organs canât get the amount of oxygen they need. You may get headaches, dizziness, blurred or double vision, itching, and blood clots.Â Is high or low hemoglobin bad?Â Yourhemoglobinlevels give your doctor important information about the health of your red blood cells. Both high and low levels of hemoglobin can be signs that your tissues and organs arenât getting the oxygen they need. They can also indicate underlying problems. Is high hemoglobin something to worry about? Some causes of high hemoglobin can be serious, such as bone marrow disease, congenital heart disease, heart failure, and scarred lungs. But other factors that can cause it include time spent at a high altitude and dehydration. Your doctor can test you for conditions that may be raising your hemoglobin levels. What causes hemoglobin to be a little high?Â Most often, high hemoglobin happens because your blood oxygen levels have been low for some time. This might be because of an illness or injury. Your doctor will examine you and may do tests to find out whatâs behind your high hemoglobin levels. SOURCES: American Diabetes Association: âA1C Test,â âA1C and eAG.â Clinical Chemistry.

Your doctor may suspect you have diabetes if you have some risk factors for diabetes, or if you have high levels of blood sugar in your urine. Your blood sugar (also called blood glucose) levels may be high if your pancreas is producing little or no insulin (type 1 diabetes), or if the body is not responding normally to insulin (type 2 diabetes). Getting diagnosed begins with one of three tests. In most cases, your doctor will want to repeat a test that is high in order to confirm the diagnosis: Your doctor may also suggest a zinc transporter 8 autoantibody (ZnT8Ab) test. This blood test -- along with other information and test results -- can help determine if a person has type 1 diabetes instead of another type. The goal of having the ZnT8Ab test is a prompt and accurate diagnosis, and that can lead to timely treatment. Diabetes is a serious disease that you cannot treat on your own. Your doctor will help you make a diabetes treatment plan that is right for you -- and that you can understand. You may also need other health care professionals on your diabetes treatment team, including a foot doctor, nutritionist, eye doctor, and a diabetes specialist (called an endocrinologist). Treatment for diabetes requires keeping close watch over your blood sugar levels (and keeping them at a goal set by your doctor) with a combination of medications, exercise, and diet. By paying close attention to what and when you eat, you can minimize or avoid the "seesaw effect" of rapidly changing blood sugar levels, which can require quick changes in medication dosages, especially insulin.Â Find outhow to choose the right diabetes treatment for you. If you have type 1 diabetes, your pancreas no longer makes the insulin your body needs to use blood sugar for energy. You will need insulin in the form of injections or through use of a continuous pump. Learning to give injections to yourself or to your infant or child may at first seem the most daunting part of managing diabetes, but it is much easier thanÂ you think. Some people with diabetes use a computerized pump -- called aninsulin pump-- that gives insulin on a set basis. You and your doctor program the pump to deliver a certain amount of insulin throughout the day (the basal dose). Plus, you program the pump to deliver a certain amount of insulin based on your blood sugar level before you eat (bolus dose). Injectable insulin comes in five types: A rapid-actinginhaled insulin(Afrezza) is also FDA-approved for use before meals. It must be used in combination with long-acting insulin in patients withtype 1 diabetesand should not be used by those who smoke or have chronic lung disease. It comes as a single dose cartridge.Premixed insulin is also available for people who need to use more than one type of insulin. Insulin degludec (Tresiba) is a once-daily, long-acting insulin, providing a basal dose of insulin lasting beyond 42 hours. (It's the only basal insulin approved for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in patients as young as 1 year old.) It is also available in combination with rapid-acting insulin (Ryzodeg 70/30). Each treatment plan is tailored for the person and can be adjusted based on what you eat and how much you exercise, as well as for times of stress and illness. By checking your own blood sugar levels, you can track your body's changing needs for insulin and work with your doctor to figure out the best insulin dosage. People with diabetes check their blood sugar up to several times a day with an instrument called a glucometer. The glucometer measures glucose levels in a sample of your blood dabbed on a strip of treated paper. Also, there are now devices, called continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS), that can be attached to your body to measure your blood sugars every few minutes for up to a week at a time. But these machines check glucose levels from skin rather than blood, and they are less accurate than a traditional glucometer. For some people withtype 2 diabetes, diet and exercise are enough to keep the disease under control. Other people need medication, which may include insulin and an oral drug. Drugs for type 2 diabetes work in different ways to bring blood sugar levels back to normal. They include: Some pills contain more than one type of diabetes medication. They include the recently approvedempagliflozin/linagliptin(Glyxambi). It combines a SGLT2 inhibitor that blocks reabsorption of glucose into the kidneys with a DPP-4 inhibitor which increases hormones to help the pancreas produce more insulin and the liver produce less glucose. Eating a balanced diet is vital for people who have diabetes, so work with your doctor or dietitian to set up a menu plan. If you have type 1 diabetes, the timing of your insulin dosage is determined by activity and diet. When you eat and how much you eat are just as important as what you eat. Usually, doctors recommend three small meals and three to four snacks every day to maintain the proper balance between sugar and insulin in the blood. A healthy balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in your diet will help keep your blood glucose on target. How much of each will depend on many factors, including your weight and your personal preferences. Watching your carbohydrates -- knowing how much you need and how many you are eating -- is key to blood sugar control. If you are overweight, either a low-carbohydrate, low-fat/low calorie, or Mediterranean diet may help you get your weight to goal. No more than 7% of your diet should come from saturated fat, and you should try to avoid trans fats altogether. Try to fill half your plate with nonstarchy vegetables such as: Also, make sure to get some of these: You can also get protein from vegetarian options like tofu. Stick to whole-grain foods. If you eat cereals, check the ingredients and make sure whole grain is first on the list. Examples of whole grains include: In general, less-processed food is better. It has a lowerglycemic index, which means it may have less of an effect on your blood sugar. For example, oatmeal from whole oats has a lower glycemic index than instant oatmeal. If you have type 2 diabetes and follow a healthy diet and exercise routine, you could lose weight and improve your diabetes. One study found long-term weight loss through diet and exercise could lower your chances of having a stroke and dementia. Another crucial element in a treatment program for diabetes is exercise. With either type of diabetes, check with your doctor before starting an exercise program. Exercise improves your body's use of insulin and may lower blood sugar levels. To prevent your blood sugar from falling to dangerously low levels, check your blood sugar and, if necessary, eat a carbohydrate snack about half an hour before exercising. If you start to feel symptoms of low blood sugar (called hypoglycemia), stop exercising and have a carbohydrate snack or drink. Wait 15 minutes and check again. Have another snack again if it is still too low. Exercise helps some people with type 2 diabetes lower their blood glucose levels and may help prevent the disease in those at risk. For people with either type of diabetes, exercise can lower the chance of having a heart attack or stroke and can improve circulation. It may offer stress relief, as well. People with type 2 diabetes who need to lose weight can benefit from moderate exercise. Most people with diabetes are encouraged to get at least 150 minutes each week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity, like walking. Strength training is often recommended at least twice a week. Talk to your doctor about what type of exercise is right for you. Learn how to start (and stick with) a workout routine when you have diabetes. If you aren't active now, start slow. Then build up how much exercise you get over time. Shoot for four to seven periods of activity each week. Try to make each period last at least 30 minutes. And you don't have to work out at the gym to be active. Take the stairs instead of an elevator, or park at the far end of the lot. Both add exercise to your daily routine. Have a realistic goal and make a plan. What exercises will you do, and when will you do them? For example, you might plan to walk 30 minutes most days on your lunch break. Change your activities often enough so you don't get bored. You can do aerobic activities like walking or jogging. And resistance exercises like working out with weights offer another option. Whatever you do, don't forget to stretch before and after each workout session. It's important to realize that exercise lowers your blood sugar. Talk to your doctor about whether you need to adjust your meds or insulin dose to keep your levels high enough. Wear a medical ID tag It is a good idea to wear a MedicAlert bracelet or tag that says you have diabetes. This will make others aware of your condition in case you have a severe hypoglycemic attack and are not able to make yourself understood, or if you are in an accident and need emergency medical care. Identifying yourself as having diabetes is important because hypoglycemic attacks can be mistaken for drunkenness, and victims often aren't able to care for themselves. Without prompt treatment,hypoglycemiacan result in a coma or seizures. And, because your body is under increased stress when you are ill or injured, your blood sugar levels will need to be checked by the medical personnel who give you emergency care. Take care of your teeth Be sure to take good care of your teeth and floss regularly. Diabetes can worsen gum disease. Reduce stress If you're stressed, you may exercise less, drink more, and not watch your diabetes as closely. Stress can also raise your blood sugar and make you less sensitive to insulin. When you're stressed, your body adopts a "fight or flight" response. That means it will make sure you have enough sugar and fat available for energy. Studies of people with type 1 diabetes found blood sugar levels go up for most people under mentalstressand down for others. If you have type 2 diabetes and you're feeling pressure, your glucose will go up. If something has you bothered, try to make changes that can help you relax. You might exercise, spend time with friends, meditate, or replace negative thoughts with positive ones. Do whatever works for you. Support groups,counseling, or therapy can help, too. Quit smoking Kick the habit. It'll give you better control of your blood sugar levels. If you smoke, you're also more likely to have serious health problems as well as a higher chance for complications from diabetes. Those can include: Cut back on alcohol If you're on insulin or oral diabetes meds like sulfonylureas or meglitinides, drinking alcohol can drop blood sugar to dangerous levels. When you drink, your liver has to work to remove the alcohol from your blood instead of regulating your blood sugar. Drunkenness and low blood sugar can also cause dizziness, disorientation, and sleepiness. You could confuse the symptoms of too much alcohol and low blood sugar. A woman should have no more than one drink a day. For men, the limit is two drinks per day. One drink is 12 ounces of beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine, or an ounce and a half of liquor like vodka. With mixed drinks, choose no-calorie mixers like club soda or diet soda. Try switching to a light beer or wine spritzer. You can also sip more slowly or switch to water or another calorie-free drink. If you cut back on the drinks, you may eat better. Alcohol can lower your willpower to resist overeating. Take notes Keeping a detailed daily log can help you track what affects your glucose levels. That log can include: After a week or so, see if you notice any patterns. If you're trying to lose weight, write down everything you eat or drink for a week or two, including portion size. That'll give you a clear picture of where you stand and what changes you can make. If you drink alcohol, check your blood sugar before you drink, while you drink, before you go to bed, and the following day. Alcohol lowers blood sugar for up to 24 hours after you finish your last drink. Vitamins and minerals Alternative medicine should never be used alone to treat diabetes. But there are things you can do -- in addition to medication, proper diet, and exercise -- that may help control your blood sugar and preventcomplications of diabetes. Although chromium does have an effect on insulin as well as on glucose metabolism, there is no evidence that taking chromium supplements can help in the treatment of diabetes. But chromium is found in many healthy foods, such as green vegetables, nuts, and grains. Studies have suggested that biotin, also called vitamin H, when used with chromium, may improve glucose metabolism in people with diabetes. But no studies have shown that biotin by itself is helpful. Vitamins B6 and B12may help treat diabetic nerve pain if you have low levels of these vitamins and that is contributing to the nerve pain. But otherwise, there is no proof that taking these vitamins will help. Vitamin Cmay make up for low blood levels of insulin, which normally works to help cells absorb the vitamin. Proper amounts of vitamin C may help the body maintain a good cholesterol level and keep blood sugar levels under control. But too much can cause kidney stones and other problems. Check with your doctor to see if a vitamin C supplement is right for you. Vitamin Emay help limit damage to the blood vessels and help protect against kidney and eye disease. But too much can lead to serious problems, such as a higher risk of stroke. Talk to your doctor before adding this supplement. Magnesiumhelps control blood sugar levels. Some people with diabetes have a serious magnesium deficiency. Magnesium supplements, in this case, may improve the action of insulin. Mind/body medicine Guided imagery, biofeedback, meditation, hypnotherapy, and yoga reduce stress hormones, which in turn may help stabilize blood sugar levels. Biofeedback may also help lower blood pressure, but more research is needed to discover its role in the treatment of diabetes and high blood pressure. Herbal remedies Capsaicin cream, a topical ointment made with cayenne, has been reported by some patients to help lower pain in the hands and feet from diabetic neuropathy. But people with loss of sensation in the hands or feet should use caution when using capsaicin, as they may not be able to fully feel any burning sensation. Check with your doctor if you are thinking of trying this product. Evening primrose oilis thought to help diabetic nerve pain, but no conclusive evidence has yet been found. Ginkgo, garlic, holy basil leaves, fenugreek seeds, ginseng, and hawthorn are other herbals that have been promoted by some as remedies fordiabetic symptoms. More research is needed to see what, if any, role these herbals may play. Check with your doctor before trying any herbal product.

A good health care team is key to staying well when you or your child has diabetes. According to the American Diabetes Association, a diabetes care team should include: The patient.This is the most important member of the diabetes care team! Only you know how you feel. Your diabetes care team will depend on you to talk to them honestly and supply information about your body. Monitoring your blood sugar tells your doctors whether your current treatment is controlling your diabetes well. By checking your blood sugar levels, you can also prevent or reduce the episodes ofhypoglycemia(low blood sugar) you have. Primary doctor.Your primary care doctor is who you see for general checkups and when you get sick. This person is usually an internist or family medicine doctor who has experience treating people with diabetes, too. Your childâs regular pediatrician will make sure that all parts of your childâs health care are managed and can make referrals to other specialists. Because your primary care doctor is your main source of care, they will most likely head up your diabetes care team. Endocrinologist.Anendocrinologistis a doctor who has special training and experience in treating people with diabetes. You should see yours regularly. Dietitian.A registered dietitian (RD) is trained in the field of nutrition. Food is a key part of your diabetes treatment, so yours will help you figure out your food needs based on your weight, lifestyle, medication, and other health goals (like lowering blood fat levels or blood pressure). Nurse educator.A diabetes educator or diabetes nurse practitioner is a registered nurse (RN) with special training and background in caring for and teaching people with diabetes. Nurse educators often help you with the day-to-day aspects of living with diabetes. Eye doctor.Either anophthalmologist(a doctor who can treat eye problems both medically and surgically) or anoptometrist(someone who is trained to handle primary healthcare of the eye, such as how well the eye focuses or helping diagnose more severe problems; optometrists are not medical doctors) should check your eyes at least once a year. Diabetes can affect the blood vessels in the eyes, which can lead to losing your sight. Children with type 1 diabetes should get a dilated eye exam 5 years after diagnosis or by age 10, whichever comes first. Podiatrist.For anyone with diabetes, which can cause nerve damage in the extremities, foot care is important. Apodiatristis trained to treat feet and problems of the lower legs. These doctors have a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) degree from a college of podiatry. They have also done a residency (hospital training) in podiatry. Dentist.People with diabetes are at somewhat greater, and earlier, risk of gum disease. The excess blood sugar in your mouth makes it a nice home for bacteria, which can lead to infection. You should see your dentist every 6 months. Be sure to tell your dentist that you have diabetes. Exercise trainer.No matter what kind of diabetes you have, exercise should play a major role in managing it. The best person to plan your fitness program, along with your doctor, is someone trained in the scientific basis of exercise and in safe conditioning methods. Mental health professional.Usually a social worker orpsychologist, this expert can help you and your child handle the major lifestyle changes that come with diabetes. People with diabetes who use insulin shots usually see their doctor at least every 3 to 4 months. People who take pills or who are managing their diabetes through diet alone should have an appointment at least every 4 to 6 months. You may need to go more often if your blood sugar isn't controlled or if your complications are getting worse. Generally, your doctor wants to understand how well your diabetes is controlled and whether diabetic complications are starting or getting worse. Therefore, at each visit, give your doctor your home blood sugar monitoring record and tell them about anysymptoms of hypoglycemia(low blood sugar) or hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). Also let your doctor know about any changes in your diet, exercise, or medicines and any new illnesses you may have gotten. Tell your doctor if you've had symptoms of eye, nerve, kidney, or cardiovascular problems such as: When you have diabetes, you should get regular lab tests: You may need thyroid and liver tests, too.

Insulin is a hormone that your pancreas makes to allow cells to use glucose. When your body isn't making or using insulin the way it should, you can take manufactured insulin to help control your blood sugar.Most people take insulin by injecting it into the skin, though thereâs also a version that you inhale. If you havetype 1 diabetes, you need insulin because your pancreas no longer makes the hormone. If you havetype 2 diabetes, you may need insulin, though many people with this form of the disease can control their blood sugar without it. Â Â Â Â Â Â Many forms of insulin treat diabetes. They're grouped by how fast they start to work and how long their effects last. Thetypes of insulininclude: Rapid-acting:This type of insulin starts to work in about 15 minutes and lasts for 1 to 5 hours, depending on which type you use. You take rapid-acting insulin before a meal and itâs usually paired with a longer-acting form of insulin.Â Short-acting:Also called regular insulin, this form takes about 30 minutes to work fully and lasts 3 to 8 hours. You should take short-acting insulin 30 to 60 minutes before a meal.Â Where you inject insulin matters. Your body will absorb it most evenly if you inject it into your belly, but don't always inject into the same spot. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Intermediate-acting:Often combined with rapid- or short-acting insulin, intermediate-acting insulin covers your insulin needs for about half a day. Some people use it overnight. Intermediate-acting insulin starts working in an hour or two, and takes 2 to 4 hours to reach peak effect.Â Long-acting:This form provides a full day of insulin coverage. You will probably use a shorter-acting type of insulin with it.Â Premixed:There are several forms of premixed insulin, including Humulin, Novolog, and others. These varieties combine short-acting and intermediate-acting insulins in one bottle or insulin pen, which some people find easier to administer.Â Â What is glargine insulin used for? Glargine insulin is a type of long-acting insulin, which lasts for about 1 day.Â There are several options for taking insulin. Each method for administering insulin has its own technique. Your doctor can help you choose the one that works best for you.Â Ways to take insulin The major options for taking insulin include: Syringes:ÂMost people who use insulin administer it with a syringe, which is a tube attached to a needle that can be used to inject medicine into the body. To prepare the syringe, place the needle into a bottle of insulin and withdraw the right dose. Then you or your caregiver insert the needle into your body and inject the insulin.Â Pens:Â Similar to a syringe, an insulin pen uses a needle to inject the medicine into your body. But pens are prefilled with insulin, so you donât need to fill them from a bottle. Some insulin pens are disposable, while others can be reused by inserting a new cartridge of insulin. Pens are more convenient than syringes but more expensive to use.Â Pumps:Aninsulin pumpis a small computer that you wear on your body. It has a container full of insulin and a hose with a needle on the end, which you insert into your body. You can instruct the computer to provide a low, steady stream of insulin all day or deliver a âbolusâ of insulin after you eat a meal to control your blood sugar.Â Inhalers:Â If you use rapid-acting insulin, you have the option to inhale it instead of injecting. To use Afrezza, which has been available in the United States since 2015, you place an oral inhaler to your mouth and breathe the medicine into your lungs.Â Best insulin injection sites The place on the body where you give yourself the shot may matter. You'll absorb insulin the most evenly when you inject it into your belly. The next best places to inject it are your arms, thighs, and buttocks. Make it a habit to inject insulin at the same general area of your body, but change up the exact injection spot. Some doctors recommend spacing out injection sites by at least the width of one finger or slightly more if you use an insulin pump. This helps lessen scarring under the skin. If you develop hard lumps in your injection site, you may have scarring and need to use a different injection site.Â Which is the least painful spot to inject insulin? One small study found that people withdiabetesconsidered insulin injections in the belly to be less painful than injections in the upper arm or thigh. However, these patients also said that they didnât think insulin injections were very painful to begin with. The belly is also the best place to inject insulin, since you absorb the medicine more evenly. Be sure to insert the needle at least a few inches from your belly button.Â Your doctor will work with you to prescribe the type of insulin that's best for you and your diabetes. Making that choice will depend on many things, including: Your doctor may prescribe more than one type. You might need to take insulin more than once daily, to space your doses throughout the day, or to add other medicines. Afrezza, a rapid-acting inhaled insulin, is FDA-approved for use before meals for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The drug peaks in your blood in about 15-20 minutes and it clears your body in 2-3 hours. It must be used along with long-acting insulin in people with type 1 diabetes. The chart below lists the types of injectable insulin with details aboutonset(the length of time before insulin reaches the bloodstream and begins to lower blood sugar),peak(the time period when it best lowers blood sugar) andduration(how long insulin continues to work). These three things may vary. The final column offers some insight into the "coverage" provided by the different insulin types in relation to mealtime. Â Follow your doctor's guidelines on when to take your insulin. The time span between your shot and meals may vary depending on the type you use. In general, though, you should coordinate your injection with a meal. You want to time your shot so that the glucose from your food gets into your system at about the same time that the insulin starts to work. This will help your body use the glucose and avoid low blood sugar reactions. From the chart above, the "onset" column shows when the insulin will begin to work in your body. You want that to happen at the same time you're absorbing food. Good timing will help you avoid low blood sugar levels. Â Long-acting insulins arenât tied to mealtimes. Youâll take detemir (Levemir)once or twice a day no matter when you eat. And youâll take glargine (Basaglar, Lantus, Toujeo)once a day, always at the same time. Deglutec is taken once a day, and the time of day can be flexible. But some people do have to pair a long-acting insulin with a shorter-acting type or another medication that does have to be taken at mealtime. Rapid-acting products can also be taken right after you eat, rather than 15 minutes before mealtime. You can take some of them at bedtime. For more information about when to take insulin, read the "dosing and administration" section of the insulin product package insert that came with your insulin product, or talk with your doctor. The major side effects include: With inhaled insulin, there's a chance that your lungs could tighten suddenly if you haveasthmaor the lung diseaseCOPD. Always have two bottles of each type you use on hand. You don't need to refrigerate vials of insulin that you're using. A good rule of thumb is that if thetemperatureis comfortable for you, the insulin is safe. You can store the bottle that you're using at room temperature (not higher than 80 F) for 30 days. You don't want it to get too hot or too cold, and keep it out of direct sunlight. Keep your extra backup bottles in the refrigerator. The night before you're going to start using a new bottle, take it out and let it warm up. Don't let your insulin freeze. Always look at your insulin inside the bottle before you draw it into the syringe. Rapid-acting, short-acting, and certain long-acting types should be clear. Other forms may look cloudy, but they shouldn't have clumps. If you carry a bottle with you, be careful not to shake it. That makes air bubbles, which can change the amount of insulin you get when you withdraw it for an injection. For insulin pens, check the package insert for storage instructions. Check the directions on the package. You should keep a sealed package in the refrigerator until you're ready to start using it. If you don't, you must use it within 10 days. You can refrigerate packages you've opened, but let a cartridge warm up to room temperature for 10 minutes before you use it. There are many forms of insulin, which differ by how long it takes them to start working, reach their peak effectiveness, and stop working. Your doctor can help you determine which insulin or combination of the different types of insulin is right for you. There are also different ways to take insulin, so you can choose the option that you find convenient and easiest to use.Â Â How many types of human insulin are there? There are five general types of insulin made for treating diabetes. All types of insulin help cells use glucose for energy. The different types of insulin vary according to how rapidly they go to work and last in the body.Â The five main types of insulin are: How long does Novolog last? Novolog (the brand name for insulin aspart) lasts 3 to 5 hours. Novolog is a rapid-acting insulin. It begins working in as little as 10 minutes and reaches peak effectiveness in 40 to 50 minutes.Â Which insulin is best? No form of insulin is best. Each category of insulin has unique properties that determine how long it takes to work, reach its peak effectiveness, and stop working. Using a combination of different types of insulin can help you control blood sugar.Â Does type 2 diabetes require insulin? People with type 2 diabetes who canât control their blood sugar by making lifestyle changes and taking other diabetes treatments may need to use insulin. Some people with type 2 diabetes use insulin and otherdiabetes treatments.Â Is Lantus a long-acting insulin? Lantus is a long-acting insulin. Its effects last up to 1 day. There are other types of long-acting insulins, including Basaglar and Toujeo.Â SOURCES: Thomson Micromedex.Â Sanofi-Aventis Group in the United States.Â New Zealand Ministry of Health.

Toujeo is an injectable insulin medication for the treatment of diabetes (type 1 or type 2) in people who are 6 years old and older. It is a long-acting form of insulin, which allows it to last for a long time in the body to help control blood sugars. It is classified as a concentrated insulin, which means that it has more units of insulin per milliliter (mL) than standard insulin.Â The active ingredient in Toujeo is insulin glargine. It works by regulating blood sugar breakdown in two ways. First, it causes an increase in blood sugar uptake into the skeletal muscles and fat cells. Second, it helps to stop sugar production in the liver. Insulin can be thought of as the key that unlocks your cells to allow the sugar to move from the blood into the cells.Â The dose of Toujeo that you are prescribed will be specifically for you and your diabetes. It can be injected under the skin of the thigh, stomach, or outer area of the upper arm. It is given once a day at the same time each day.Â Toujeo comes as a pre-filled insulin pen. Your health care provider will show you how to inject the drug before you use it the first time. Your prescription should come with âInstructions for Use,â which explains how to prepare and give a dose. There is also a video available at the drug companyâs website:What Is Toujeo Max Solostar Pen? | Toujeo (insulin glargine) injection 300 Units/mL. Ask your pharmacist or other health care provider if you are unsure how to use Toujeo.Â Overall, there were five early studies that all lasted 26 weeks (about 6 months). These studies included one in adults with type 1 diabetes, one in children with type 1 diabetes, and three in adults with type 2 diabetes. In all the studies, the patients knew what drug they were taking. They were either taking Toujeo or the standard treatment at the time called Lantus. Both of these products are the same active ingredient â insulin glargine â but their strength is different. Toujeo is 300 units/mL and Lantus is 100 units/mL. Most of the people in all of the studies were White and male. The average age of the people in the type 1 diabetes trial for adults was 47 years old. The average age of the people in the type 1 diabetes trial for children was 13 years old. The average age of the people in the type 2 diabetes trials for adults was 58-60 years old.Â At the end of all the studies, Toujeo lowered A1c and fasting blood sugar as well as the standard Lantus product. Â Your results may differ from what was seen in clinical studies. Toujeo starts working right away, but it might take some time for your health care provider to find the dose that will work best for you. It is important to monitor your blood sugar as directed by your health care provider to help them find the best dose. You should keep track of your blood sugar numbers and bring them to all your appointments.Â The most common side effects of Toujeo include low blood sugar, injection site reactions, and weight gain.Â Low blood sugar.The most commonly reported side effect is low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia. Signs of low blood sugar include sweating, shakiness, hunger, and a fast heartbeat. Low blood sugar can happen suddenly, and signs can be different in each person. Severe low blood sugar can lead to seizures or cause death. So it is important to talk to your health care provider about symptoms of low blood sugar. You should create a plan to treat low blood sugar if it were to happen. You can help prevent low blood sugar by eating meals at regular intervals, double-checking your insulin dose before injecting it, and testing your blood sugar as directed. You can consider wearing a medical alert bracelet that shows you have diabetes.Â Injection site reactions.Injection site reactions are usually mild and can include symptoms such as pain, itching, swelling, or discoloration of the skin where you got the shot. If you notice any of these symptoms, ensure your injection technique is good by reading the directions for use again. The best way to decrease these reactions is to inject the drug into a different part of the body each time, which is called rotating the injection site. For example, Toujeo can be injected into different parts of the thigh, stomach, or outer area of the upper arms. Donât inject the drug into skin that is already tender, damaged, bruised, or scarred. If injection site reactions continue, contact your health care provider for further instructions.Â Weight gain.Weight gain is common with insulin because it causes the sugar to go from your blood to your cells. If you do not use the sugar, then it is stored in the body as fat. High blood sugars can also make you urinate more. As your blood sugars become more controlled, you will urinate less. This may cause you to retain more water, which can increase weight. To help prevent weight gain, monitor your diet and exercise. You may want to consider working with a nutritionist to help you create a diet plan that is right for you.Â These are not all of the possible side effects of Toujeo. Talk with your health care provider if you are having symptoms that bother you. You can also report side effects to the FDA at 800-FDA-1088 (800-332-1088). Several medicines can interact with Toujeo.Â Drugs that may lower blood sugars.ÂCombining Toujeo with other medications that lower blood sugar can increase the chance of low blood sugar events. If the medications are used together, lower doses of Toujeo or more frequent blood sugar tests may be needed. A common example of this interaction is one that comes with other diabetes medications.Â Drugs that may increase blood sugar.ÂCombining Toujeo with other medications that increase blood sugars may cause high blood sugar levels. If the medications are used together, higher doses of Toujeo or more frequent blood sugar tests may be needed. Common examples are reactions with corticosteroids like prednisone or certain antipsychotics like olanzapine.Â This is not a complete list of medicines that may interact with Toujeo. Tell your health care provider about all the prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, vitamins/minerals, herbal products, or other supplements you take or have recently taken. This will help them find out if there are any interactions. Do not start or stop other medicines without talking to your health care provider. Toujeo offers financial services to help you with medication costs. There is a copay card available from the drugmaker that may allow you to pay $35 per month for your prescription. Whether you are eligible depends on whether you have prescription insurance, and what type of insurance you have. You can find out about all the financial services athttps://www.toujeopro.com/savings-and-coverage.

A look at what causes high blood sugar and symptoms of the disease. Plus, when you're more likely to have high blood sugar. (Photo Credit: Mrs.rungrudee Khangkhun/Dreamstime) Hyperglycemia (also calledhigh blood sugar or high blood glucose) is when there's too much glucose (sugar) in your bloodstream, typically because your body isn't making or using insulin as well as it should. Insulin is a hormone that helps balance out your blood sugar levels. Around 1 in 10 people in the United States have diabetes.Blood sugar control is at the center of any diabetes treatment plan. Hyperglycemia is a major concern, and can affect people with both type 1 andtype 2 diabetes. There are two main kinds: When it happens often or all the time, high glucose levels can cause damage to your nerves, blood vessels, and organs. It can also lead to other serious conditions.Â It's important to treat high blood sugar right away to help avoid more health problems. Hyperglycemia vs. Hypoglycemia These conditions are related to blood sugar, but they're very different. Hyperglycemia is when your blood sugar spikes too high, while hypoglycemia means your blood sugar level is lower than normal.Â As your body breaks down the food you eat, it turns carbs into a type of sugar called glucose, which gives you energy. Glucose goes into your bloodstream after you eat, but it needs insulin, a hormone from the pancreas, to get into your body's cells so they can use it. When your blood sugar rises, your pancreas releases insulin, letting glucose into cells. Your liver and muscles store extra glucose, which keeps your blood sugar levels normal. Diabetes interrupts this process. In type 2 diabetes, your body resists insulin or doesn't make enough of it, so sugar stays in your blood. When you have diabetes, your blood sugar may rise if you: Insulin resistance A major reason why you may have hyperglycemia is insulin resistance. It's also the leading cause of type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance happens when your muscle, fat, and liver cells react abnormally to insulin. As a result, your body needs higher amounts of insulin to balance out your blood sugar levels. If your body doesn't get the insulin it needs, you'll end up with hyperglycemia.Â Here are some reasons why you could have insulin resistance: The dawn phenomenon Another possible reason for a spike in your blood sugar is what's called the dawn phenomenon. This is when your blood sugar rises in the morning, usually between 4 and 8 a.m. Researchers aren't sure what causes the dawn phenomenon. But they think when your body releases certain hormones (growth hormone, cortisol, and others) overnight, it boosts insulin resistance and raises your blood sugar. Causes of high blood sugar in the morning include: Hyperglycemia in people without diabetes People without diabetes can also have high blood sugar. Causes include: Early hyperglycemia symptoms include: Ongoing high blood sugar may cause: Diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) If hyperglycemia symptoms become too serious, you could form another life-threatening health problem calleddiabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA). When you can't process glucose, your liver makes chemicals called ketones for your body to use for fuel. A lack of insulin coupled with too many ketones causes your blood to turn acidic.Â DKA tends to happen inpeople with diabetes who take insulin or those with type 1 diabetes but haven't been diagnosed. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include: DKA is an emergency and can trigger a coma or death. Go to a hospital right away if you notice any symptoms. You're more likely to have hyperglycemia if you: Talk to your doctor about whether you should take more diabetes medicine than normal when you're ill or dealing with stress. If you have diabetes and notice any of the early signs of high blood sugar, test your blood sugar and call the doctor. TheyÂ may ask you for the results of several readings. TheyÂ could recommend the following changes: Drink more water.Water helps remove extra sugar from your blood through urine, and it helps you avoid dehydration. Exercise more.Working out can help lower your blood sugar. But under certain conditions, it can make blood sugar go even higher. Ask your doctor what kind of exercise is right for you. Caution:If you have type 1 diabetes and your blood sugar is high, you need to check your urine for ketones. When you have ketones, do NOT exercise. If you have type 2 diabetes and your blood sugar is high, you must also be sure that you have no ketones in your urine and that you are well-hydrated. Then your doctor might give you the OK to exercise with caution as long as you feel up to it. Change your eating habits.You may need to meet with a dietitian to change the amount and types of foods you eat. Switch medications.Your doctor may change the amount, timing, or type of diabetes medications you take. Donât make changes without talking to them first. If you have type 1 diabetes and your blood sugar is more than 250 mg/dL, your doctor may want you to test your urine or blood forketones. Call your doctor if your blood sugar is running higher than your treatment goals. If you work to keep your blood sugar under control â follow your meal plan, exercise program, and medicine schedule â you shouldnât have to worry about hyperglycemia. You can also: Living with hyperglycemia can mean other health problems, some that mean you need help right away and others that you may live with for the rest of your life.Â Long-term health problemsUntreated hyperglycemia can trigger other long-term health problems, such as: Emergency health problemsSome conditions caused by blood glucose levels that are too high need treatment right away: Both conditions can cause you to go into a coma, and even lead to death if they aren't treated.Â Â Blood sugar controlis crucial in managing diabetes since high blood sugar can lead to health problems. Track your blood sugar, take insulin or other medicines as prescribed by your doctor, keep a balanced diet, stay hydrated, and exercise routinely to manage high blood sugar. If you notice symptoms of hyperglycemia, talk to your doctor about your diabetes management plan. What are symptoms of hyperglycemia? Symptoms of early hyperglycemia include: Does hyperglycemia turn into diabetes? If you have hyperglycemia, this typically means you have diabetes. You may have hyperglycemia episodes a lot if you live with diabetes.

People withdiabetesget hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) when their bodies don't have enough sugar to use as fuel. It can happen for several reasons, including diet, some medications and conditions, and exercise. If you get hypoglycemia, write down the date and time when it happened and what you did. Share your record with your doctor, so they can look for a pattern and adjust your medications. Call your doctor if you have more than one unexplained low blood sugar reaction in a week. Most people feel symptoms of hypoglycemia when their blood sugar is 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or lower. Each person with diabetes may have different symptoms of hypoglycemia. You'll learn to spot yours. Early symptoms include: Without treatment, you might get more severe symptoms, including: Ask your doctor if any of your medicines can cause low blood sugar. Insulin treatment can cause low blood sugar, and so can atype of diabetesmedications called "sulfonylureas." Commonly used sulfonylureas include: Older, less common sulfonylureas tend to cause low blood sugar more often than some of the newer ones. Examples of older drugs include: You can also get low blood sugar if you drink alcohol or take allopurinol (Zyloprim), aspirin,Â probenecid (Benemid,Â Probalan), or warfarin (Coumadin) with diabetes medications. You shouldn't get hypoglycemia if you take alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, biguanides (such as metformin), and thiazolidinediones alone, but it can happen when you take them with sulfonylureas or insulin. You can get low blood sugar if you take too much insulin for the amount of carbohydrates you eat or drink. For instance, it can happen: Don't skip meals if you have diabetes, particularly if you're takingdiabetes medications. If you have diabetes and think you have hypoglycemia, check your blood sugar level. Do your levels often drop after meals that include a lot of sugars? Change your diet. Avoid sugary foods, and eat frequent small meals during the day. If you get low blood sugar when you haven't eaten, have a snack before bedtime, such as a protein or a more complex carbohydrate. In cases of severe hypoglycemia, you may require an injection ofbaqsimi,Âdasiglucagon(Zegalogue), or glucagon injection (Gvoke). Your doctor may find that you take too much insulin that peaks toward the evening-to-morning hours. In that case, they may lower your insulin dose or change the time when you get your last dose of it. First, eat or drink 15 grams of a fast-acting carbohydrate, such as: Fifteen minutes after you've eaten a food with sugar in it,check your blood sugaragain. If your blood sugar is still less than 70 mg/dL, eat another serving of one of the foods listed above. Repeat these steps until your sugar becomes normal. Hypoglycemia may make you pass out. If so, you'll need someone to give you a glucagon injection. Glucagonis a prescription medicine that raises blood sugar, and you may need it if you have severe hypoglycemia. It's important that your family members and friends know how to give the injection in case you have a low blood sugar reaction. If you see someone having a severe hypoglycemic reaction, call 911 or take them to the nearest hospital for treatment. Do not try to give an unconscious person food, fluids, or insulin, as they may choke. It's very dangerous. If you're driving and you have hypoglycemia symptoms, pull off the road, check your blood sugar, and eat a sugary food. Wait at least 15 minutes, check your blood sugar, and repeat these steps if necessary. Eat aproteinand carbohydrate source (such as peanut butter crackers or cheese and crackers) before you drive on. Be prepared. Keep a sugar source in your car at all times for emergencies. If you have diabetes, ways you can prevent hypoglycemia include: SOURCES:Â National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse (NDIC): âHypoglycemia.â American Diabetes Association: âHypoglycemia.â Zammitt, N.Diabetes Care, 2005.

Glucose meters are a great tool, but sometimes, you need to keep a closer eye on your blood sugar levels (type 1 diabetesand type 2 diabetes). That's where a device called a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) can help. This FDA-approved system tracks your blood sugar levels day and night and collects readings automatically. It can help detect trends and patterns that give you and your doctor a more complete picture of your diabetes. The data can help you find ways to manage your condition better. Several continuous glucose monitors are available for adults and children. You need a prescription from your doctor to get one. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) A continuous glucose monitor measures the amount of glucose in the fluid inside your body. Different devices collect the information in different manners using tiny sensors. In some cases, the sensor is placed under theÂ skinÂ of your belly, which is a quick and painless process. Or you can adhere the sensor to the back of your arm. A transmitter on the sensor sends the information to a wireless-pager-like monitor, which you can clip on your belt. The monitor displays your sugar levels at 1-, 5-, 10-, or 15-minute intervals. If your sugar drops to a dangerously low or high preset level, the monitor will sound an alarm. In the past, only doctors could see the readings CGM systems collected. Now, anyone can use the devices as part of at-home diabetes care. You can download data on your computer, tablet, or smartphone to see patterns and trends in your sugar levels. The information can help you and your doctor make the best plan for managing your diabetes, including: A continuous glucose monitor doesnât replace traditional home monitors. Youâll still need to measure your blood sugar with a regular glucose meter a few times a day to help the monitor stay accurate. Most monitors still require a finger stick, and you should also replace the sensor under your skin every 3 to 7 days. Implantable glucose sensors Right now, EVS is the only implantable glucose sensor available. It includes a fluorescence-based sensor, an external transmitter, and a mobile app to display glucose data. A medical team puts the sensor into your upper arm, then the transmitter on the skin over it to collect data and send it via Bluetooth to the app on your phone. This system needs a 24-hour warm-up and a 12-hour sensor calibration period several times. You have to charge your transmitter for about 15 minutes every day. Sensor-augmented pumps If you use aninsulin pump, you can also link it to your CGM system for continuous care. You wonât need to manually program the pump as with the other finger-prick methods. This is called a âsensor-augmented pump.â Sensor-augmented insulin pumps are a better choice because they offer advanced features such as automatic basal rate adjustments and predictive glucose management. These features improve blood sugar control and lower hypoglycemia, especially during challenging activities. They combine data from CGMs directly into the pump, making it easier for people with diabetes to manage their condition in real time. These systems require detailed training and support from specialists to make sure you use them correctly. Unlike traditional glucose meters, CGM records your blood sugar levels throughout the entire day and night, showing your highs and lows over the entire week. The systems can help: CGM isn't right for every person with diabetes, though. Theyâre more expensive than glucose meters, and your insurance or Medicaid might not cover oneunless you take insulin medication. You may also need some extra training and practice to use the technology correctly. Also, CGMs don't completely get rid of the need for finger-prick checks, but they do lessen how often you need to use them. It's important to talk to your diabetes health care provider about when and how often to check your blood sugar with finger pricks.Â Researchers have been trying to figure out whether short-term continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can improve blood sugar control and behavior.Â One study assessed a 10-day trial of CGM in kids and young adults withtype 2 diabetes. While short-term use of CGM didn't significantly improve blood sugar levels, it did lead to positive behavior changes. Participants checked their blood sugar and took insulin more often. They also expressed a desire to continue using CGM long-term. Future studies may better clarify the impact of short-term CGM use on blood sugar control. Your doctor may suggest a CGM if you have: Adults and children aged 2 and older can use the device. The FDA recently approved smartphone apps to pair with the CGM. Information on blood glucose is shared immediately. Itâs expected to be a great help to parents and caregivers who canât always be in the same place as the person who has diabetes. Here are some tips for using your CGM: Take calibration seriously.Always wash your hands before taking a fingerstick for calibration. If you can't wash, use the second drop of blood after wiping away the first drop to avoid incorrect readings caused by dirty hands. Retake fingerstick.If your CGM and fingerstick readings are far apart, wash your hands and retake the fingerstick to make sure the CGM or meter is accurate. This can prevent insulin overdoses. Calibrate when glucose is stable.Avoid calibrating when your blood sugar is low or changing quickly. Mornings or before bed are good times to calibrate since glucose is often stable. Be cautious on day 1.CGMs can be less accurate on the first day, especially right after inserting a new sensor. Be patient and understand accuracy tends to improve over time. Improve day 1 accuracy.Try inserting a new sensor several hours before activating it while the old one is still running. This will allow for a better warm-up and improved accuracy on the first day. Switch devices if needed.Try different brands if your CGM and blood glucose meter don't match well. The accuracy of both devices can vary depending on the brand and model. Alarms are helpful tools.View CGM alarms as valuable tools for tracking your glucose, not something negative. Adjust the alarm thresholds to what feels best for you. Avoid over-correcting highs.Avoid overreacting to high glucose alarms with too much insulin. Pay attention to trend arrows.Use the arrows on your CGM to guide insulin adjustments. Rising arrows may mean you need more insulin, while falling arrows may mean you need less. Try different sensor wear locations.Consider trying different skin locations, such as the back of your arm or abdomen, to find the best spot for accuracy. Watch out for Tylenol.If your CGM device reacts to acetaminophen (Tylenol), avoid relying on sensor readings for several hours after taking it. Possible drawbacks of using CGMs include: The FDA has approved the first over-the-counter CGM, the Dexcom Stelo Glucose Biosensor System. This device is for people aged 18 or older who don't use insulin. It is meant for people who manage their diabetes with oral drugs or those without diabetes who want to track how diet and exercise affect their blood sugar. It's not suitable for people with dangerously low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) since it doesn't alert users to this condition. The Stelo system uses a wearable sensor that connects to a smartphone app, providingblood sugar readingsevery 15 minutes. You can wear each sensor for up to 15 days. But you should talk to your doctor before making medical decisions based on the device's data. Scientists are also testing new and better CGM systems in clinical trials. The technology is also a key part of researchersâ efforts to build an artificial pancreas that could mimic the bodyâs natural process of controlling insulin. Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) track blood sugar levels around the clock, providing valuable data for managing diabetes. They measure glucose through a sensor placed under the skin, which sends readings to a monitor or smartphone. CGMs help identify trends, reducehypoglycemia, and guide insulin adjustments, making them beneficial for diabetes management.Â However, CGMs require regular calibration, can be costly, and may cause information overload or skin irritation. New advancements, including over-the-counter CGMs, are making the technology more accessible, and ongoing research aims to improve accuracy. What is a blood glucose monitor watch? Blood glucose monitors are smartwatches that claim to measure blood glucose levels without piercing your skin. The FDA has not approved them and warns people not to buy or use them.

Most people with diabetes should test their blood sugar (or blood glucose) levels regularly. Knowing the results lets you adjust your strategy for keeping the disease in check. Regular testing can also help you avoid getting long-term health problems that can stem from the condition, like: Research shows that in people with either type 1 ortype 2 diabetes, sticking to your target blood sugar and HbA1c levels makes complications less likely. A blood sugar test measures the level of sugar (glucose) in your blood. Most people with diabetes should test theirblood sugar levelsregularly. Knowing the results lets you adjust your strategy for keeping the disease in check. There are different ways to do the test, including: Glucometers A glucose meter, or glucometer, is a portable machine that can measure your blood sugar level from a small sample of your blood. You access your blood in different ways with different types of glucometers. From your fingertip:Â You prick your finger with a small, sharp needle (called a lancet) and put a drop of blood on a test strip. Then you put the test strip into a meter that shows your blood sugar level. You get results in less than 15 seconds and can store this information for future use. Some meters can tell you your average blood sugar level over aperiodof time and show you charts and graphs of your past test results. You can get blood sugar meters and strips at your local pharmacy. If you test your blood sugar with a fingertip prick, you can find out your glucose levels in 15 seconds. (Photo Credit: Moment/Getty Images) Meters that test other sites:ÂNewer meters let you test sites other than your fingertip, such as your upper arm,forearm, base of the thumb, and thigh. You may get different results than from your fingertip. Blood sugar levels in the fingertips show changes more quickly than those in other testing sites. This is especially true when your blood sugar is rapidly changing, like after a meal or afterexercise. If you are checking your sugar when you have symptoms ofhypoglycemia, you should use your fingertip if possible, because these readings will be more accurate. Continuous glucose monitoring system:These devices, also called interstitial glucose measuring devices, are combined with insulin pumps. They are similar to finger-stick glucose results and can show patterns and trends in your results over time.Â There are different kinds of CGM systems. Some are separate devices, and others are attached to an insulin pump.Â HbA1c home testsÂ Hb stands for hemoglobin, which is the protein inside red blood cells that carries oxygen. When your blood sugar is chronically high, more sugar binds to hemoglobin, so an HbA1c test can give you an estimate of the average amount of glucose in the blood over time. To take an HbA1c test, you prick your finger and put a drop of blood on a test strip for a reading. Some HbA1c tests involve mailing your blood sample to a lab.Â At-home HbA1c tests arenât as accurate as lab tests, but they can be helpful if in-person visits with a doctor arenât easy for you because of distance or other reasons. You can report your results to a doctor from home so they have an idea of how your blood sugar is doing.Â Laboratory tests for diabetes Your doctor may recommend you take a laboratory test for your diabetes. Options include: Fasting blood sugar test.ÂYour doctor will ask you not to drink or eat for 8-12 hours before this test. In a clinic, a technician will either prick your finger or draw blood from a vein in your arm using a needle and test the result in a lab. Yourfastingblood glucose level should be the lowest level you have. A normal result is under 99 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). If your results are higher, itâs a sign that you could have prediabetes or diabetes.Â Oral blood glucose test.Â Doctors also call this a glucose tolerance test. It measures your bodyâs response to sugar. For this test, your doctor will have you drink a syrupy glucose solution that has 75 grams of sugar. A technician will take a blood sample an hour later and 2 hours later to see how your body has processed the sugar. A healthy blood glucose level, 2 hours after you drink the solution, is lower than 140 mg/dL. HbA1c.ÂLike the home HbA1c test, this test estimates your averageblood glucose levelsover a period of time. For the test, a doctor collects a blood sample by drawing blood from a vein in your arm and sends the sample to a lab for testing.Â Most people withtype 1 diabetesshould monitor their blood sugar 4-6 times a day. You may need to check it several times throughout the day, such as before meals or exercise, at bedtime, before driving, and whenever you suspect your blood sugar levels are low. Everyone is different, so ask your doctor when and how often you should check your blood sugar. If you're sick, you'll probably need to test your blood sugar more often. 1 Having certain conditions, likeanemiaorgout, can affect your blood sugar levels.Â Other conditions can make a difference in your results, too, such as: If you keep seeing unusual results, recalibrate your meter and check the test strips. The chart below gives you an idea of where your blood sugar level should be throughout the day. Your ideal blood sugar range may be different from another person's and will change throughout the day. Home blood glucose monitoring and HbA1c Monitoring your HbA1c level is also important for diabetes control. Many home glucose monitors also display an average blood glucose reading, which can correlate with your HbA1c. Average Blood Glucose Level (mg/dL) HbA1c (%) 126 (100-152) 6 154 (123-185) 7 183 (147-217) 8 212 (170-249) 9 240 (193-282) 10 269 (217-314) 11 298 (240-347) 12 Â Ask your doctor about your target blood sugar range, and make a plan for how to handle blood sugar readings that are either too high or too low and when to call your doctor. Learn about the symptoms of high orlow blood sugar, and know what you can do if you begin to have symptoms. Keep good records of any blood, urine, or ketone tests you do. Most glucose monitors also have a memory. Your records can alert you to any problems or trends. These test records help your doctor make any needed changes in your meal plan, medicine, or exercise program. Bring these records with you every time you see your doctor. Some devices send your readings to a computer or mobile device, making it easy to share the data directly with your diabetes care team. As youâre recording your blood sugar, make a note of yourdietand movement (even activities like gardening can make a difference) around the time of your reading. This will give you a fuller picture of whatâs affecting your levels and better inform how to keep them steady in the future.Â To ensure youâre getting the most accurate read on your blood sugar, be sure youâre doing your testing correctly. Follow these tips: Testing your blood sugar is one of the most important tools for managing diabetes. You can monitor blood sugar at home with glucose meters and test strips, continuous glucose monitoring systems, and HbA1c tests. Your doctor will help you know what your target range should be and what may affect your readings. The A1C target goal should be individualized , yet a a goal of <7.0% is recommended by experts as a practical level for most patients to reduce the risk of long-term complications of diabetes. Should I check my blood sugar if I have diabetes? Monitoring your blood sugar levels is one of the most important parts of diabetes management. Knowing your blood sugar levels informs your daily treatment and helps you keep your levels as steady as possible as you make choices about what to eat and do during the day.Â What should your blood sugar level be if you have diabetes? Target blood sugar levels vary by person. Your doctor will be able to tell you the healthiest range for your age, size, lifestyle, and other medical conditions. Your target range may also change as you age. In general, most (non-pregnant) adults should have a range of 80-130 mg/dL before meals and less than 180 mg/dL 1 to 2 hours after the beginning of a meal. What blood sugar level confirms diabetes? To diagnose diabetes, your doctor will look at your HbA1c levels, which give a measurement of your blood sugar levels over time. An HbA1c level of 6.5% or higher on two separate tests means you have diabetes. An HbA1c between 5.7% and 6.4% means that you have prediabetes. Below 5.7% is considered normal. How often should I check my blood sugar for type 2 diabetes? Your doctor will tell you when itâs most important to check your blood sugar. Itâs important to test when you have symptoms of high or low blood sugar. In general, itâs good to check when you first wake up, before and after meals, before and after exercise, and before you go to sleep.Â What is the normal range for a blood sugar test? A normal range for a fasting blood sugar test is 70 to 99 mg/dL. A non-fasting blood test will give variable results, depending on when you last ate, but should be below 125 mg/dL. Are non-invasive blood sugar tests accurate? Researchers are still honing methods for testing blood sugar that donât involve getting a blood sample. These include passing a type of radiation into a part of the body with lots of veins, or analyzing sweat, saliva, tears, or urine. Developers are still working on accurate ways to do this. Data from blood is still the most reliable method today. SOURCES: The Diabetes Toolbox. FDA.

Nerve paincaused by diabetes, known as diabeticperipheral neuropathy, can be severe, constant, and hard to treat. It may start as a tingling feeling, followed by numbness and pain. But there are at least two key points that everyone withdiabetesand peripheral neuropathy should know: If you have diabetes and peripheral neuropathy, talk to your doctor about how to manage your diabetes.Â Once you're doing all you can -- including diet, meal planning, exercise, and medication -- ask the doctor whichpain treatmentcould best relieve the rest of your symptoms. There are many medications that can ease nerve pain and help you function at near-normal levels. But you may need to try several different types before you find the one that works best. Some people find relief right on drugstore shelves. Common pain relievers and someskincreams may help. It depends on how severe your pain is. Talk to your doctor before taking any product. Even over-the-counter medications can interact with other drugs or cause severe side effects. Here are some options: NSAIDs(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)Âreduceinflammationand relieve pain. Those available without a prescription includeaspirin,ibuprofen, andnaproxen. But NSAIDs are known to increase the risk ofheart attackand stroke, especially when taken in high doses. They can also cause harmful side effects likestomachirritation and bleeding if you take them for a long time. They can also lead to or worsen pre-existingÂkidneydamage, which may be more likely in people with diabetes. AcetaminophenÂand other over-the-counter drugs that contain it relieve pain without reducing inflammation. These medications don't cause the stomach irritation that NSAIDs do, but taking more than recommended can lead toliverdamage. Read labels and check with your pharmacist. CapsaicinÂis found naturally in chili peppers. It acts on nerve cells in your skin that are involved in sending pain signals to your brain. It can help in the short term, but there are concerns about long-term use. That's because these same nerves play a role in wound healing, a process that's already a problem if you have diabetes. LidocaineÂis an anesthetic that numbs the area it's applied to. It's available in gels and creams, both over the counter and by prescription. Many people need to turn to prescription medication to find relief. Antidepressantstreat depression but have also become important in relievingchronic pain. They can work whether you're depressed or not. Those used to treat pain include: Antiseizure drugs,used to prevent epilepticseizures, can also relieve neuropathy. The drugs control the nerve cells in the brain and other parts of your body, such as legs and arms, that transmit pain. But they can make you dizzy or sleepy, especially at high doses. Opioid medicines.When your problem is severe, you want immediate relief. That's when you should see a pain specialist. You might need strong medicines that contain a weak opioid (amorphine-like substance). These drugs also affect the brain chemicals serotonin and norepinephrine, similar to antidepressants, and reduce your feeling of pain. Opioidscan provide a better solution for "breakthrough pain" -- a kind that suddenly worsens for no apparent reason -- than OTC drugs. Neuropathy specialists shy away from strong narcotic opioid medications. They can cause severeconstipation, and there's a chance you could get addicted. There's also a stigma connected with using this type of drug. And depending on the type of work you do, it could be a problem. Prescription capsaicin patchesÂ(Qutenza) offer the pain-relieving benefits of capsaicin in a prescription-strength skin patch. Once every 3 months, you apply up to 4 patches to your skin and leave them in place for 30 minutes.Â Injections of local anesthetics like lidocaine -- or patches that contain it -- can also numb the area. Doctors could also: Other useful aids to improve your quality of life include: SOURCES:Â Christopher Gibbons, MD, director, Neuropathy Clinic, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston.Â National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke: "Peripheral Neuropathy Fact Sheet."Â American Chronic Pain Association: ACPA Medications & Chronic Pain, September 2005.

Want another reason to get yourblood sugar levelsunder control and keep them that way? Doing so can help you avoid many diabetes skin problems. Still, skin conditions related to this disease are common. As many as 1 out of 3 people with diabetes will have one. Fortunately, most can beÂ successfully treated before they turn into a serious problem. The key is to catch them early. Itchingskin, also calledpruritus, can have many causes, such as dry skin, poor blood flow, or ayeast infection. When itching is caused by poor blood flow, youâll likely feel it in your lower legs and feet. Lotion can help to keep your skin soft and moist, and prevent itching due to dry skin. Bacterial infections:Staphylococcus skin infections are more common and more serious in people with poorly controlled diabetes. When hair follicles are irritated, these bacteria can cause boils or an inflamed bump. Other infections include: Most bacterial infections need to be treated with antibiotic pills. Talk with your doctor. Fungal infections:Warm, moist folds of the skin are the perfect breeding ground for these infections.Three common fungal infections are: A yeast-like fungus called "Candida albicans" causes many of the fungal infections that happen to people with diabetes. Women are likely to get this in their vaginas. People also tend to get this infection on the corners of their mouth. It feels like small cuts and is called "angular cheilitis." Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the fingernails and toenails that is more prevalent among people with diabetes. It causes discoloration, thickening, and separation from the nail bed. Medicines that kill fungus -- called antifungals -- are usually needed to treat these infections. Talk with your doctor about the right ones to use. Acanthosis nigricans:This condition is most common in people withtype 2 diabetes. It causes darkened and thickened skin, especially in skin folds. It looks like a small wart. Skin becomes tan or brown. Itâs sometimes slightly raised and may look velvety. It can be found on the sides or back of the neck, the armpits, under the breast, and groin. Sometimes, the top of your knuckles will look strange. This condition usually affects people who are very overweight. It usually starts before diabetes, and it can be a sign of insulin resistance. While there's no cure, losing weight may help. Vitiligo:This condition affects your skin color. It's more common withtype 1 diabetes. Withvitiligo, the cells that make the substance that gives your skin color, melanin, are destroyed. Patches of skin look discolored. They often appear on the chest and stomach. But they can also show up on the face around the mouth, nose, and eyes. Steroid creams, ultraviolet light treatments, and micropigmentation (tattooing) are a few treatment options. Use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to prevent sunburn on your discolored skin. Shin spots (diabetic dermopathy):This condition happens due to changes to the blood vessels in your skin. Dermopathy appears as a shiny round or oval lesion on the thin skin of your shins. The patches don't hurt, and they rarely cause itching or burning. Treatment usually isn't necessary. Necrobiosis lipoidica:If youâve had diabetes for a long time without good control of your blood sugar, you could develop this condition. Poor blood supply to the skin can cause changes in the collagen and fat underneath. The overlaying skin becomes thin and red. Most lesions are found on the lower parts of the legs and can turn into an ulcer if thereâs trauma. Lesions have fairly well-defined borders. Sometimes, the condition is itchy and painful. As long as the sores don't break open, you won't need treatment for them. If the sores do break open, see your doctor. Digital sclerosis:Due to poor blood flow, the skin on your toes, fingers, and hands becomes thick, waxy, and tight. It can also make your finger joints stiff. Get your blood sugar under control, because that can help treat this condition. Try lotions and moisturizers to help soften the skin. When you have issues with your heart or blood vessels: Diabetes-related blisters (bullous diabeticorum):In rare cases, people with diabetes get blisters that resemble burn blisters. These can affect the fingers, hands, toes, feet, legs, or forearms. They're usually painless and they heal on their own. They often happen in people who have severe diabetes anddiabetic neuropathy. For treatment, your doctor will help you get your blood sugar levels under control. Disseminated granuloma annulare:While there is some controversy over whether this condition is connected to diabetes, disseminated granuloma annulare causes sharply defined ring- or arc-shaped areas on the skin. These rashes most often happen on the fingers and ears, but they can appear on the chest and abdomen, too. The rash can be red, red-brown, or skin-colored. Treatment usually isn't needed, but sometimes a steroid medication you put on your skin, such as hydrocortisone, can help. Scleredema diabeticorum:This condition causes a thickening of the skin on the back of the neck and upper back. It's rare, but it can affect people with type 2 diabetes. The treatment is to bring your blood sugar levels under control. Lotions and moisturizers might help soften your skin. SOURCES: American Diabetes Association: "Skin Complications."

Diabetic nephropathy âkidney diseasethat results from diabetes â is the number one cause ofkidney failure. Almost a third of people withdiabetesget diabetic nephropathy. People with both diabetes and kidney disease do worse overall than people with kidney disease alone. This is because people with diabetes tend to have other long-standing medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, andbloodvessel disease (atherosclerosis). People with diabetes also are more likely to have otherkidney-related problems, such asbladder infectionsandnerve damageto thebladder. Kidney disease intype 1 diabetesis slightly different from that intype 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes,kidneydisease rarely begins in the first 10 years after diagnosis of diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, some patients already have kidney disease by the time they are diagnosed with diabetes. Kidney disease that results from diabetes is the number one cause of kidney failure. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) There are often no symptoms with early diabetic nephropathy. As the kidney function worsens, symptoms may include: As kidney damage progresses, your kidneys cannot remove the waste from your blood. The waste then builds up in your body and can reach poisonous levels, a condition known as uremia. People with uremia are often confused and occasionally become comatose. Your doctor may run routine tests to evaluate your kidney health, including: Urinary albumin test.This screens for the protein albumin in your urine. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) blood test.This shows how well your kidneys are filtering your blood. The lower your GFR, the more kidney function you've lost. Treatments are available that can help slow progression to kidney failure. That's why you should have your urine tested every year if you have diabetes. The stages of diabetic nephropathy are based on how progressed your kidney disease is. Your doctor will check how well your kidneys are filtering out waste through a measure called the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Healthy kidneys in young adults have an eGFR of about 120. Stage Function Level Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) Loweringblood pressureand maintainingblood sugarcontrol are necessary to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy. There are medications available that have been found to slow down the progression of kidney damage. They include: Unfortunately, the kidney damage caused by diabetic nephropathy can't be reversed. If not treated, the kidneys will continue to fail and larger amounts of proteins can be detected in the urine. Advanced kidney failure needs treatment withdialysisor akidney transplant. But you can slow down the progression of the disease by watching what you eat, staying active,avoiding harmful medications, quitting smoking, keeping your weight in check,and taking the medications your health care provider prescribes. Take steps to control your diabetes, cholesterol, and blood pressure to avoid further kidney damage. You'll rarely notice symptoms of diabetic nephropathy early on, but signs can include being more fatigued than usual and leg swelling. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) block the effects of a hormone called angiotensin II. This hormone worsens kidney disease by increasing the pressure on the filters of your kidneys. One study has found that, on average, diabetic nephropathy may shorten your lifespan by about 16 years.

Diabetescan slow down your body's ability to fight infection. The high sugar levels in your blood and tissues allow bacteria to grow and help infections develop more quickly. Common sites for these problems are your bladder, kidneys,vagina, gums,feet, and skin. Early treatment can prevent more serious issues later on. Most infections in people with diabetes can be treated. But you have to be able to spot the symptoms. Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following: SOURCE: National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse: âPrevent Diabetes Problems: Keep Your Feet and Skin Healthy.â Â© 2005 - 2025 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

Type 2 diabetes is a lifelong disease that keeps your body from using insulin the way it should. People who are middle-aged or older are most likely to get this kind of diabetes. It used to be called adult-onset diabetes or diabetes mellitus. But type 2 diabetes also affects kids andteens, mainly because ofchildhood obesity. Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes. About 1 in 10 people in the U.S. have type 2. Nearly 1 in 3 have prediabetes, meaning their blood sugar (or blood glucose) is high but not high enough to be diabetes yet. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes can be so mild that you don't notice them. About 9 million people have it and don't know it. Symptoms include: If you have dark rashes around your neck or armpits, see your doctor. These are called acanthosis nigricans, and they can be signs that your body is becoming resistant to insulin. Learn more about type 2 diabetes symptoms. There are three main types of diabetes: Type 2 diabetes About 90%-95% of all people with diabetes have this type. With type 2, your pancreas makes someinsulinâ the hormone that helps your cells turn glucose (a type of sugar) from the food you eat into energy. In some people, your cells don't respond to this hormone as they should (a condition called insulin resistance). Type 1 diabetes In type 1, your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin, leading to high blood sugar. Doctors aren't sure why this happens. Type 1 isn't related to weight or lifestyle habits. It used to be called insulin-dependent or childhood diabetes.Â Gestational diabetes You only get this type of diabetes when you're pregnant. It happens because hormonal changes andweight gainduring pregnancy can lead toinsulin resistance. It usually goes away after you have your baby. Usually, a combination of things causes type 2 diabetes. They might include: Genes.Scientists have found different bits of DNA that affect how your body makes insulin. Weight.Having extra weight or obesity can cause insulin resistance. Metabolic syndrome.People with insulin resistance often have a group of conditions including high blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol and triglycerides. Too much glucose from your liver.When your blood sugar is low, your liver makes and sends out glucose. After you eat, your blood sugar goes up, and your liver usually slows down and stores its glucose for later. But some people's livers don't. They keep making sugar. Bad communication between cells.Sometimes, cells send the wrong signals or don't pick up messages correctly. When these problems affect how your cells make and use insulin or glucose, this can lead to diabetes. Broken beta cells.If the cells that make insulin send it out at the wrong time, your blood sugar gets thrown off.High blood sugarcan damage these cells, too. Certain things make it more likely that youâll get type 2 diabetes. The more of these factors apply to you, the higher your chances of getting it. It's good to be aware of what can cause type 2 diabetes, such as: Risk factors related to your medical history and health include: Other things that raise yourrisk of diabetesare related to your daily habits and lifestyle. These are the ones you can change: Type 2 diabetes epidemiology Some 462 million people worldwide, or about 6.3% of the population, have type 2 diabetes. It's the ninth leading cause of death, responsible for more than 1 million deaths each year. Cases of type 2 diabetes are increasing faster in developed countries such as the U.S. and Western Europe. Scientists say type 2 diabetes affects men and women at about the same rate. It's more common in people in middle age and older, affecting: It's also more common in people of color, including those whose heritage is: Your doctor can test your blood for signs of type 2 diabetes. Usually, theyâll test you on 2 different days to confirm the diagnosis. But if yourblood glucoseis very high or you have many symptoms, one test may be all you need. Blood tests for type 2 diabetes include: A1c.It's an average percentage of your blood glucose over the past 2 or 3 months. Fasting plasma glucose.This is also known as a fasting blood sugar test. It measures your blood sugar on an empty stomach. You won't be able to eat or drink anything except water for 8 hours before the test. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).This checks your blood glucose before and 2 hours after you drink something sweet to see how your body handles the sugar. Learn more about how type 2 diabetes is diagnosed.Â Researchers have defined four stages of type 2 diabetes: Insulin resistance In this stage, your body usually makes enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels in the normal range. But if your cells "resist" the insulin (don't use it correctly), your body will make more insulin to help the glucose get into them. Insulin resistance can be temporary, but it can also last. There's no test to detect insulin resistance, so it can be hard to diagnose. Prediabetes Eventually, insulin resistance causes glucose to build up in your blood. You have prediabetes when your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered diabetes. An A1c between 5.7% and 6.4% means you haveprediabetes. You may not have any symptoms, but prediabetes ups your risk for heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.Â Type 2 diabetes If your A1c is 6.5% or higher, you have diabetes. You may have symptoms such as increased thirst, blurred vision, and numbness in feet or hands. Or you may not have any symptoms at all.Â Type 2 diabetes with vascular complications At this stage, your diabetes has led to vascular (blood vessel) problems. You may have damage to vessels in your eyes (retinopathy), kidneys (nephropathy), and certain nerves (neuropathy). You might also develop heart disease, stroke, or circulation issues. Managing type 2 diabetes includes a mix of lifestyle changes and medication. Lifestyle changes You may be able to reach your target blood sugar levels with diet and exercise alone. Weight loss.Dropping extra pounds can help. While losing 5% of your body weight is good, losing at least 7% and keeping it off seems to be ideal. That means someone who weighs 180 pounds can change their blood sugar levels by losing around 13 pounds. Weight loss can seem overwhelming, but portion control and eating healthy foods are a good place to start. Healthy eating.Thereâs no specific diet for type 2 diabetes. A registered dietitian can teach you about carbs and help you make a meal plan you can stick with. Focus on: Exercise.Try to get 30-60 minutes of physical activity every day. You can walk, bike, swim, or do anything else that ups your heart rate. Pair that with strength training, such as yoga or weightlifting. If you take a medication that lowers your blood sugar, you might need a snack before a workout. Watch your blood sugar levels.Depending on your treatment, especially if youâre on insulin, your doctor will tell you if you need to test your blood sugar levels and how often to do it. Type 2 diabetes medication If lifestyle changes donât get you to your target blood sugar levels, you may need medication. Some of the most common for type 2 diabetes include: Metformin(Fortamet, Glucophage, Glumetza, Riomet). This is usually the first medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. It lowers the amount of glucose your liver makes and helps your body respond better to the insulin it does make. Sulfonylureas.This group of drugs helps your body make more insulin. They include glimepiride (Amaryl), glipizide (Glucotrol), and glyburide (DiaBeta, Micronase). Meglitinides.They help your body make more insulin and work faster than sulfonylureas. You might take nateglinide (Starlix) or repaglinide (Prandin). Thiazolidinediones.Like metformin, they make you more sensitive to insulin. You could get pioglitazone (Actos) or rosiglitazone (Avandia). But they also raise your risk of heart problems, so they arenât usually a first choice for treatment. DPP-4 inhibitors.These medications â linagliptin (Tradjenta), saxagliptin (Onglyza), and sitagliptin (Januvia) â help lower your blood sugar levels, but they can also cause joint pain and could inflame your pancreas. They work by blocking DPP-4, which is an enzyme that affects the hormone incretin. GLP-1 receptor agonists.You take these medications through a needle to slow digestion and lower blood sugar levels. Some of the most common ones are exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon), liraglutide (Victoza), and semaglutide (Ozempic). Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.These medications miglitol (Glyset) and acarbose (Precose) slow your body's digestion of sugar. Let your doctor know if you have kidney, liver, or heart issues or if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. These medicines are unlikely to cause low blood pressure and weight gain; however, side effects include gastrointestinal issues and abnormal liver readings. Biguanides.This medication, metformin (Fortamet, Glucophage, Glumetza, and Riomet), lowers blood sugar levels. Typical side effects include gastrointestinal issues, nausea or vomiting, weakness, and headache. You should avoid drinking large amounts of alcohol when taking this drug because it may trigger a rare side effect, a buildup of acid in your blood called lactic acidosis. SGLT2 inhibitors.These help your kidneys filter out more glucose. You might getbexagliflozin (Brenzavvy),canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), or empagliflozin (Jardiance). Empagliflozin has also proven effective in reducingÂ the risk of hospitalization or death from heart failure. GIP and GLP-1Â receptor agonist.Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) is the first in this class andÂ activates both the GLP-1 and GIP receptors, which leads to improved blood sugar control. Insulin.You might take long-lasting shots at night, such as insulin detemir (Levemir) or insulin glargine (Lantus). Even if you change your lifestyle and take your medicine as directed, your blood sugar may still get worse over time. That doesnât mean youâve done something wrong. Diabetes is progressive, and many people eventually need more than one drug. When you take more than one drug to control your type 2 diabetes, thatâs called combination therapy. You and your doctor should work together to find the best mix for you.Â Some drugs control blood sugar spikes (also called hyperglycemia) that come right after meals, for instance. Others are more effective at stopping drops in blood sugar (hypoglycemia) between meals. Some may help with weight loss or cholesterol, as well as your diabetes. You and your doctor should talk about any possible side effects. Cost may be an issue as well. If you take medication for something else, that will need to be factored into any decision. Youâll need to see your doctor more often when you start taking a new combination of drugs. You might find that adding a second drug doesnât bring your blood sugar under control. Or the combination of two drugs might work only for a short time. If that happens, your doctor might consider a third non-insulin drug, or you may start insulin therapy. SurgeriesÂ for type 2 diabetes Weight loss surgery can effectively treat type 2 diabetes by helping youlose weight. These procedures limit how much food you can eat or how many nutrients your body can take in. You'll need to commit to long-term healthy lifestyle changes to get the full benefits of this type of surgery.Â Several types are available. Talk to your doctor about whether weight loss surgery is right for you. Alternative treatments for type 2 diabetes There's not much scientific evidence that any alternative treatment can help you manage your blood sugar. Research into dietary supplements has found that: Some research has found that mind-body practices such as yoga and meditation might help with blood sugar control when used along withdiabetes drugs.That may be because of their stress-relief benefits. Always talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatment. These treatments can't replace diabetes medications. Some populations are more likely to get type 2 diabetes. Latino (12%), Black (12%), and Asian (10%) people have higher rates of diabetes than white people (7%). American Indians get it at about twice the rate as white people (14.5%). Members of racial and ethnic minority groups with type 2 are also likely to have worse health outcomes. Yet research shows that members of minority groups are less likely to use newer diabetes medications, regardless of their income or whether they havehealth insurance. And no matter what their ethnicity, people with lower incomes were less likely to take these medications. Across all races and ethnicities with diabetes, about 15% live in poverty, 19% have difficulties accessing food, and 51% have low-quality diets. Also, Black, Latino, and Native American people are less likely to be included in clinical studies to try new diabetes drugs. Over time, high blood sugar can damage and cause problems with your: Heart and blood vessels.If you have high blood sugar, youâre up to twice as likely to get heart disease or have a stroke, and at a younger age compared to those with normal sugar. Youâre also at high risk of blocked blood vessels (atherosclerosis) and chest pain (angina). Kidneys.If your kidneys are damaged or you have kidney failure, you could need dialysis or a kidney replacement. Eyes.High blood sugar can damage the tiny blood vessels in the backs of your eyes. If left untreated, it can cause blindness. Nerves.This can lead to trouble with digestion, loss of sensation in your feet, and sexual problems. Skin.Your blood doesnât circulate as well, so wounds heal slower and can become infected. Pregnancy.Parents with diabetes are more likely to have a miscarriage, a stillbirth, or a baby with a birth defect. Sleep.You might develop sleep apnea, a condition in which your breathing stops and starts while you sleep. Hearing.Youâre more likely to have hearing problems, but itâs not clear why. Brain.High blood sugar can damage your brain and might put you at a higher risk of Alzheimerâs disease. Depression.People with the disease are twice as likely to get depressed as people who donât have it. The best way to avoid these complications is to manage your type 2 diabetes well. To do that: Managing diabetes is complicated. You'll need to adopt healthy lifestyle habits, check your blood sugar regularly, and keep up with doctor visits and treatments. But your efforts can have a big impact on your health and your quality of life. Type 2 diabetes diet Adietitiancan help you create a personalized meal plan that takes your needs and preferences into account. A healthy diabetes diet should focus on: Type 2 diabetes costs On average,people diagnosed with diabetes have medical expenses that are 2.6 times higher than those without the disease. Your annual medical expenses can average$19,736 a year,$12,022 of which is directly due to diabetes.Â These expenses include doctor visits, hospitalizations, and medication. You may have other costs as well, such as lost time and less productivity at work. Managing type 2 diabetes Managing your type 2 diabetes well helps you avoid complications and feel your best. Along with a healthy diet, regular exercise, and medication as prescribed: Type 2 diabetes and mental health A long-term health condition can take a toll on your mental health. Peoplewith diabetes are two to three times as likely to havedepressionand 20% more likely to have anxiety than those without the condition. Many don't get diagnosed or treated, even though therapy, medication, or a combination can work very well. Many people with diabetes sometimes get overwhelmed by the pressures of trying to manage the condition. This is called diabetes distress, and it can lead to you to neglect your health. A support group or counseling could help you overcome it. If you're worried about your emotional health, ask your doctor to recommend a mental health professional. The long-term outlook for people with type 2 varies depending on how effectively they manage the condition. At age 50, the average life expectancy (LE) for those with type 2 is 6 years shorter than those without the condition. But proper care and treatment can help you improve those odds.Â Can type 2 diabetes be cured? There's no cure for type 2. You may be able to get your blood sugar under control by losing weight and making healthy lifestyle changes and might even be able to stop taking diabetes medications. But this isn't the case for everyone.Â What to expect with type 2 diabetes Type 2 is a serious condition that demands lifelong management. Over the long term, high blood sugar can lead to heart, vision, and kidney problems. But you can take steps to avoid these complications and extend your life. Several studies show that: All these things also reduce your risk of developing other diseases. Adopting a healthy lifestyle can help you lower your risk of diabetes: Type 2 diabetes is a serious condition that requires lifelong management. Weight loss, a healthy lifestyle, and medications, if needed, can help you keep it under control. All can help you live a longer, healthier life. Can you reverse type 2 diabetes? Type 2 diabetes is not curable, but the glucose levels of some people can return to normal or prediabetes levels in what is called complete and partial remission. People are able to accomplish this mainly by losing weight. Sometimes, the beta cells, which make insulin, stop working, in a condition known as glucose toxicity. You might also go into remission when your glucose levels decrease and your beta cells start to produce insulin again. What lifestyle changes can help prevent or manage type 2 diabetes? If you have an increased risk for diabetes, making lifestyle changes can help prevent the disease. Some things you can do: Is type 2 diabetes an autoimmune disease? There is a type of diabetes that develops in adulthood called latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). In people with LADA, the pancreas stops making insulin, similar to type 1 diabetes but at a slower rate. In LADA, an autoimmune response damages pancreatic cells and causes them to stop working.Â What role does diet play in the management of type 2 diabetes? Diet plays a tremendous role in managing your diabetes. A healthy diet can help manage your blood sugar levels as well as lower cholesterol levels and blood pressure. It's important to know what carbohydrates may be "good" or "bad" for your diabetes. You should greatly reduce unhealthy refined carbohydrates and foods high in added sugar, salt, and fats. A diet rich in whole grains, fiber, vegetables, lean proteins, legumes, and some fruits is a healthy one if you have diabetes. How does exercise impact type 2 diabetes management? As with a healthy diet, exercise is important in managing your diabetes. Exercise is key in losing and managing weight and lowering cholesterol and blood pressure. Studies have found that exercise can lower A1c levels by nearly 1%, even in people who lost no weight, regardless of the type of exercise. Other findings: walking at least 2 hours weekly lowered the risk of death from heart disease, particularly in women. Also, combining aerobic exercise and resistance training helps lower insulin resistance in adults who previously didn't exercise at all.

Prediabetes,Â or borderline diabetes, is when yourÂ blood sugarÂ level is higher than it should be but not high enough for your doctor to diagnose diabetes.Â People with type 2 diabetes almost always have prediabetes first. But it doesnât usually cause symptoms. About 98 million people in the U.S. have prediabetes, but more than 80% donât know that they have it. Prediabetes treatment can prevent more serious health problems, includingÂtype 2 diabetesÂ and problems with yourÂ heart, blood vessels,Â eyes, andÂ kidneys. Your doctor might also call this condition: Most people don't have any signs of prediabetes. But you might notice that: Prediabetes symptoms in women Some early diabetes symptoms that could affect women (and those assigned female at birth) in particular are: You get prediabetes because you have insulin resistance. That's when your body makesinsulin(a hormone that helps regulate the levels of sugar in your bloodstream) but doesn't use it correctly. This causes your blood sugar levels to be higher than they should be. Insulin resistance causes Doctors aren't sure exactly why people develop insulin resistance. But things that can contribute to it include: Â Prediabetes risk factors Youâre more likely to get prediabetes if you: Get tested for prediabetes if those things apply to you and if you: Why race and ethnicity matter in prediabetes As with diabetes, prediabetes is more common in people of certain ethnic and racial groups. Native Americans and Alaska Natives have the highest rates of diabetes among populations in the U.S. An estimated 75,000 people in the Navajo Area alone are thought to have prediabetes. According to the CDC, prediabetes affects about: There are many reasons for the disparities, including family health history and differences in access to health care, healthy foods, and safe places to exercise. Prediabetes and gender The CDC says prediabetes affects men at a slightly higher rate (41%) than women (32%). Some early studies indicated that gender-affirminghormone therapymight worsen insulin resistance and increase the risk of diabetes in transgender women. But follow-up studies showed conflicting results, so more research is needed into this. Â Â Â Your doctor will do at least one of these tests: Fasting plasma glucose test You wonât eat for 8 hours, and then a technician will take your blood to test the sugar levels. The results indicate: Oral glucose tolerance test First, you'll have a fasting plasma glucose test. Then, you'll drink something sugary. After 2 hours, a technician will take more blood for testing. The results indicate: Hemoglobin A1c test This blood test shows your average blood sugar levels for the past 2-3 months. Doctors give it to people who have diabetes to see if their blood sugar levels are under control. They can also use it to diagnose prediabetes or diabetes. The results indicate: You may need to take the test again to confirm the results. Doctors diagnose prediabetes based on the same blood sugar levels, no matter the personâs age. The American Diabetes Association says children aged 10 and older should be tested if they have extra weight or obesity along with: If a child who has a high chance of getting prediabetes gets normal test results, the American Diabetes Association advises testing them again at least every 3 years. Without treatment, prediabetes can become type 2 diabetes. That can lead to other serious problems, including: Even before it becomes diabetes, untreated prediabetes could causelong-term damage to your blood vessels,kidneysand heart. It's been linked to so-called silent heart attacks, whose symptoms are so minor that you may not even notice them. The main treatment for prediabetes is a healthy lifestyle that includes these steps: If you're at high risk of diabetes, your doctor might also suggest you takeÂ medicationÂ suchÂ as metforminÂ (Glucophage) to lower your blood sugar. Prediabetes diet Thereâs no official diet, but these five swaps can help reverse prediabetes and lower your chances of gettingÂ type 2 diabetes: If making big diet changes seems tough, start with little changes such as: SomeÂ healthy eating plans that can lower your chances of diabetes include: If youâre not sure how to plan your meals, ask your doctor. They can refer you to a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). Thatâs a professional whoâs trained to help you find healthy ways to eat. Most importantly, theyâll want to come up with a plan you can stick to. Exercise for prediabetes When youÂ exercise, your body uses theÂ sugar in yourÂ blood to fuel yourÂ workout. Over time, regular physical activity can lower your overall glucose levels. Youâll also become more sensitive to the insulin in your body. That makes it easier for your muscles to tap into that glucose. You should get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise. Aim for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. You donât have to do anything too intense. You can: You may want to add a couple of days of strength, or resistance, training. Thatâs when you use weight machines, free weights, your own body, or exercise bands to build muscle. If youâre new to exercise, talk to your doctor about whatâs safe for you. Prediabetes and weight loss Not everyone with prediabetes needs toÂ lose weight. But if youâreÂ overweight, shedding 5%-10% of yourÂ body weight can lower your chances of diabetes by more than half. You may wonder whether carrying extra weight or being obesity causes diabetes. Thatâs something experts are still trying to figure out.Â What they do know is that extra bodyÂ fat, especially around your belly, sends out hormones that affect your appetite and causeÂinflammation. The cells that help you use insulin may get hurt in the process. Some experts think losing belly fat may help you get better control of your blood sugar. Prediabetes and sleep Studies showÂ sleep loss can make it harder to control your blood sugar and appetite. That may be why your chances ofÂ obesity andÂ type 2 diabetes go up if youÂ sleep less than 5-6 hours a night. Your chances are also higher if the quality of your sleep is bad. If you have ongoing sleep problems, skip your afternoonÂ caffeine. Youâll also want to avoidÂ alcohol close to bedtime. Both can disrupt your slumber. If that doesnât help, talk to your doctor. They can help treat yourÂinsomnia. Quit smoking Studies show people who smoke have a higher chance of prediabetes than nonsmokers. High levels of nicotine make it harder for your body to use insulin. CigaretteÂ smoking also damages your cells in a way that experts think leads to diabetes. Itâs important to talk to your doctor about how to quit. The same healthy lifestyle habits that treat prediabetes can help prevent it. Other things that can help: Unfortunately, prediabetes isn't always preventable. Some people whose genes put them at high risk for the condition may develop it even if they follow a healthy lifestyle. That's one reason it's important to keep up with your health care appointments. When you have prediabetes, your blood sugar levels are higher than they should be but not high enough to be considered diabetes. People with prediabetes are at higher risk for type 2 diabetes and the other health problems that can come along with it. You may be able to reverse it by making healthy lifestyle changes and, in some cases, by taking medicine to control your blood sugar. How often should I check my blood sugar for prediabetes? If you're healthy, your doctor will probably test your blood sugar about every 3 years. If you already have prediabetes, they'll probably do it at least once a year. Because prediabetes doesn't usually cause symptoms, regular checkups are important, especially if you have a family history of diabetes or other risk factors. Can prediabetes put my vision at risk? Research shows that it's possible for those with prediabetes to get diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to serious eye damage and sometimes blindness. If you have prediabetes, your doctor may recommend eye exams to check forretinopathy. Tell your doctor if you notice any changes in your vision.

Â Â Â Â [MUSIC PLAYING]Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â SUBJECT: I was first diagnosedÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â with Type 2 diabetes about 20Â Â Â Â Â Â Â years agoÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â during a routine doctor'sÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â offices.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I didn't have any family historyÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â of diabetes at that time.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â So it was a big shock to meÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â that I was diabetic.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And I knew that it probablyÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â would mean lifestyle changesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â that I just wasn'tÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â ready to start with.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I played basketballÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â in high school and college,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â so I really didÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â like to exercise.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Because of my workload,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â it just became harderÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â to exercise.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â When I could, I tried to walk.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And I ended up doing four milesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â a day.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And I lost about 55 pounds.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I was able to keep it off.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â My blood sugars went from 400Â Â Â Â Â Â Â down to normal, 110, 113.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And I've been able to maintainÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â that.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I guess the biggest challengeÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â for me at this pointÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â is when I become depressed,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â the first thing I doÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â is change my diet,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â drink soda and eat poorly.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And so I'm constantly--Â Â Â Â Â Â Â that's a constant battle for meÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â is to stay on a healthy diet.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Oh, my family's been extremelyÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â supportive.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â My sons call me daily to makeÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â sure I'm eating the right thingsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â and I'm not cheating.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â My daughter-in-lawÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â and several friends walk,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â actually walk with meÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â around the park.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Yeah, I got great support,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â actually.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Family, friends, doctors,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â coworkers.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I'm a professorÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â at the university level.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And my students are constantlyÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â challenging me to walkÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â after class, before classÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â to walk with me.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â So I have a lot of supportÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â out there.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And I think that's veryÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â important to have the supportÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â to stay on the right track.Â Â Â Â Insulin resistance is when cells in your muscles, fat, and liver donât respond well to insulin, a hormone made by your pancreas that helps manage your blood glucose (blood sugar). Sometimes, insulin resistance is a short-term condition. But if left untreated for a long time, it could turn into diabetes. Your body's main source of fuel is glucose, which it gets by breaking down the food you eat. Once glucose enters your bloodstream, insulin helps it get into your cells, where it's either used or stored for later. That signals your pancreas to stop makinginsulin. But if you have insulin resistance, this process doesn't work well. Your cells aren't letting glucose in when insulin "asks" them to. As a result, more and more blood glucose piles up in your bloodstream. And your pancreas keeps making insulin. For a while, your pancreas may be able to make so much extra insulin that your cells open up and let in glucose the way they're supposed to. That will keep your blood sugar within a normal range. But over time, your cells may become more insulin resistant and your blood glucose levels could keep rising. Insulin resistance vs. diabetes Insulin resistance and diabetes are related but not the same. If you haveinsulin resistance, your blood sugar is still within a normal range. Prediabetesusually happens to people who have some insulin resistance. Your blood sugar is higher than normal, but still not high enough for diabetes. Insulin resistance and prediabetes can both lead totype 2 diabetes. So much glucose stays in your bloodstream, you will need medication to treat it. You can't tell that you have insulin resistance by how you feel. You'll need to get a blood test that checks your blood sugar levels. Likewise, you wonât know if you have most of the other conditions that are part of insulin resistance syndrome (high blood pressure, low "good" cholesterol levels, and high triglycerides) without seeing your doctor. Some signs of insulin resistance include: Â If left untreated, insulin resistance can progress to diabetes. Making changes to your daily routine can help protect your health. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library) Â Experts still don't fully understand what causes insulin resistance and prediabetes. Things that can make this condition more likely include: Insulin resistance and PCOS Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects as many as 15% of people who are assigned female at birth (AFAB). It's one of the most common causes of infertility.Â If you have PCOS, you have higher-than-usual amounts of a hormone called androgen. This can make it hard for you to get pregnant. It also causes other symptoms, like acne and thinning hair. Most people with PCOS are also insulin resistant.Â The link between insulin resistance and PCOS is still unclear, but it's being studied. Your family history may play a part, since you're more likely to havePCOSif your mother or sister has it or type 2 diabetes. Excess weight can also be a factor. Insulin resistance test There isn't one specific test that checks for it. To figure out if you have insulin resistance, your doctor will rely on a combination of the following: Questions.For instance, theyâll want to know about your family's health history. Physical exam.Theyâll weigh you and check your blood pressure. Fasting plasma glucose test. This blood test measures your blood sugar after you havenât eaten for at least 8 hours. Oral glucose tolerance test.First, you'll take the fastingglucose test. Then you'll drink a sugary solution. Two hours after that, you'll take another blood test. Hemoglobin A1c test. This blood test shows your average blood sugar level for the past 2 to 3 months. Doctors use it to diagnose prediabetes or diabetes. You may need to take the test more than once to confirm the results. Lipid panel.Lipids are fatty compounds in your blood, like 'bad" LDL and "good" HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. A blood test can check your levels. High triglycerides and low "good" cholesterol have been linked to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. If your pancreas can't produce enough extra insulin to make up for your insulin resistance, your blood sugar levels could rise until you have prediabetes.Â You should be screened starting at age 35. If you're carrying extra weight or have other risk factors for diabetes, your doctor may screen you sooner. If you had gestational diabetes during a pregnancy, you should have a test at least every 3 years. These blood test results signal that you have prediabetes: If you do have prediabetes, you'll probably need to repeat this lab work at least once a year so your doctor can keep an eye on your blood glucose levels. If you arenât able to manage them, they'll keep going up.Â Youâll be diagnosed withtype 2 diabetesif your test levels reach: The goal of insulin resistance treatment is to lower your blood sugar levels and prevent type 2 diabetes.Â Medication for insulin resistance Â There's no medicine that can cure insulin resistance. But your doctor may prescribe drugs to treat other health issues you have, like high blood pressure or high LDL ("bad") cholesterol. If you're at increased risk of diabetes, you might also get a medication calledmetformin(Fortamet, Glucophage, Glumetza, Riomet). It's usually prescribed to people with diabetes to help keep blood sugar in check. Reversing insulin resistance Lifestyle changes like these can often help reverseinsulin resistance. Exercise.Being active improves how well your body uses insulin. Find an activity you enjoy so you're more likely to do it often. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity (like brisk walking) 5 or more days a week. Just starting out? Work up to that. Get to a healthy weight.Losing as little as 5% to 7% of your weight can really lower your risk of type 2 diabetes. If you're not sure how to reach a weight loss goal, ask your doctor. You may also want to talk with a nutritionist and a certified personal trainer. Eat fewer processed foods.While no foods are "bad" or off-limits, try to cut back on refined carbohydrates (like packaged baked goods), which tell your body to make more insulin. Manage your stress.Your blood sugar levels can rise when you get stressed. If you have a lot of worries or feel overwhelmed, talking to a counselor or therapist could help. Get enough sleep.Sleeping less than 7 hours a night can increase your insulin resistance. To get more rest, try not to nap after 3 p.m. and avoid alcohol and large meals before bed.Â Stop smoking.Tobacco can increase insulin resistance. Keep in mind that insulin resistance is a complex condition that doctors don't fully understand. In some cases, your blood sugar levels may not drop back to normal levels. But you may still be able to manage them. If left untreated, insulin resistance could lead to: Insulin resistance weight gain In the short term, high blood sugar levels can cause you to gain weight. Losing those extra pounds can be a challenge because your body is using those fat cells to store extra glucose. Insulin resistance and supplements More research needs to be done, but supplements that contain any of the following may help control your blood sugar. Make sure to talk to your doctor before trying any supplements, even if they're advertised as "safe" or "natural." They could still be harmful, based on your health or other medications you take. Insulin resistance and your diet No specific diet has been proven to to be the best for improving insulin resistance. But eating foods that are high in carbohydrates could make it worse. It's also a good idea to limit highly processed foods (foods where you don't recognize all the ingredients listed on the label) and high-fat foods.Â Instead, try to eat more: High-fiber foods.These help manage your blood sugar because they keep you feeling full for a long time.Â Low-glycemic foods.Theglycemic index(GI) ranks foods based on how quickly they raise your blood glucose.Â High-GI foods are often high in carbohydrates and sugar, but low on fiber. They quickly spike your blood sugar and insulin. Examples of high-GI foods to limit include: Low-GI foods, on the other hand, have a small, slow impact on your blood glucose. These are foods to try to eat often.Â Some examples are: Medium-GI foods like the ones below raise your blood sugar at an "in between" level. You can think of them as foods to eat sometimes, or in small amounts. Other eating plans to reduce insulin resistance Your doctor could also suggest that you try: TheDASH(Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet.This can help reduce insulin resistance and lower your blood pressure. It could also help you lose weight and improve your "good" cholesterol. You'll try to eat more: You'll try to cut back on: TheMediterranean diet.This is a way of life rather than a meal plan. It's been shown to help with insulin resistance and can lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. You'll try to eat more healthy, fresh food that's in season instead of fast food you eat on the go or heat up at home. You'll also try to get regular exercise and think of mealtime as a time to relax and spend time with friends and family. Generally speaking, you'll: Talk to your doctor about the eating changes they feel will benefit you the most.Â Insulin resistance doesn't guarantee that you'll get diabetes. But it's important to make changes to your eating habits and activity level, since healthy daily habits can protect your health. Getting your blood checked regularly will help your doctor keep an eye on your glucose levels.

Type 2 diabetesis a disease in which your body doesnât make enough of a hormone called insulin or doesnât use insulin the way it should. Insulin helps carry glucose (also called sugar) to your cells. So, when thereâs a problem with insulin, glucose builds up in your blood. Youâve probably heard this called high blood sugar. About 90% of people with diabetes have type 2. The other main types are type 1, in which your body stops making insulin, and gestational, which happens in pregnant people. You can usually control type 2 diabetes with lifestyle changes. Some people also need medication. You might not know that you have type 2 diabetes until it affects your health. About 1 in 4 people with the condition donât know that they have it. Symptoms can come on slowly. TheyÂ may include: More thirst.Â When sugar builds up in yourÂ blood, yourÂ kidneysÂ work harder to remove it. This pulls fluids from your tissues, making you dehydrated, so you feel thirsty. Always thirsty? Feeling parched may be an early symptom of type 2 diabetes. (Photo Credit: DigitalVision/Getty Images) MoreÂ hunger.Â Because diabetesÂ can stop glucose from getting to your cells, you feel hungry even after youâve eaten. Peeing often.Â Youâll pee more because your kidneys are working hard to remove extra sugar from your system. Dry mouth.Â DehydrationÂ and peeing a lot can drain moisture from yourÂ mouthÂ as well. Weight loss without trying.Â When you lose sugar from peeing a lot, you lose calories, too. You might lose weight even though youâre eating as usual. Fatigue.Â When your body canât use energy from food, you could feel weak and tired. Dehydration can make you feel this way, too. Blurry vision.ÂHigh blood sugarcan make you have trouble focusing. Headaches.Â HighÂ blood sugar levelsÂ can cause your head to hurt. Loss of consciousness.After you exercise, skip a meal, or take too much medication, your blood sugar could get too low, and you could pass out. Infections or sores that donât heal.Â High blood sugar can slow blood flow and make it harder for your body to heal. Tingling hands andÂ feet.Â Type 2 diabetesÂ can affect nerves in your hands and feet. Red, swollen, and tender gums.Â You might be more likely to get infections in your gums and the bones that hold yourÂ teethÂ in place. Your gums may get infected or pull away from yourÂ teeth. Your teeth might become loose. Itâs important to get your blood sugar under control to avoid these serious conditions: Hypoglycemia.Â If your blood sugar falls below 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), it can lead to accidents,Â coma, and death. Hyperglycemia.Â Blood sugar that goes above 180-200 mg/dL can give youÂ heart, nerve, kidney, and vision problems. Over the long term, it can also cause coma and death. Over time, people with type 2 diabetes may have other health problems: Diabetic ketoacidosis.Â When you donât have enoughÂ insulinÂ in your system, your blood sugar rises, and your body breaks down fat for energy. Toxic acids calledketonesbuild up and spill into yourÂ urine. It can cause coma and death if you donât treat it. Heart and blood vessel diseases.Â People with diabetes are more likely to have conditions suchÂ as high blood pressureÂ andÂ high cholesterol, which play a role inÂ heart disease. Also, high blood sugar can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart. High blood pressure.ÂDiabetes doubles your risk of high blood pressure, which makes you more likely to have heart disease orÂ stroke. Nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy).Â This can cause tingling and numbness, most often in your feet and legs. But it can also affect yourÂ digestive system, urinary tract, blood vessels, and heart. Eye damage.Â Diabetes can cause: Kidney disease.ÂYour kidneys may have to work harder to filter out the extra sugar, along with all the other waste products in your blood. Hearing problems.Â Doctors arenât sure why this happens, but they think high blood sugar levels damage the small blood vessels in yourÂ ears. Skin problems.ÂDiabetes can cause: Infections.Â Youâre more likely to get bacterial and fungal infections. Itching.ÂCauses include infections, dry skin, and poor circulation. You might notice it on your lower legs. Acanthosis nigricans.Â These velvety darker areas can appear on your neck, armpits, groin, hands, elbows, and knees. Diabetic dermopathy.Â This involves changes to small blood vessels that result in red or brown scaly patches. They often show up on your feet and the fronts of your legs. Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum.This rare condition also affects your blood vessels. It starts as a dull, red, raised area but winds up as a shiny scar with a violet border. Your skin could itch or crack open. Women are more likely to get this than men. Allergic reactions.ÂYou could get these in response to insulin or another diabetes medication. DiabeticÂ blisters (bullosis diabeticorum).ÂThese sores look like burnÂ blistersÂ and can show up on the backs of your fingers, hands, toes, feet, and sometimes legs or forearms. DisseminatedÂ granuloma annulare.ÂYou might get red, brown, or skin-colored rings or arc-shaped raised areas on your fingers,Â ears, or trunk. Type 2 was once called adult-onset diabetes because it was rare in children and teens. But it has become more common since the mid-1990s, in large part because more young people are overweight or obese, a risk factor for the disease. Also, children face a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if they donât get enough exercise or have a close relative with the condition. African American, Hispanic, Native American, Alaska Native, Asian American, and Pacific Islander children are more likely to get it. Your risk of type 2 diabetes goes up as you age because your body can become resistant toinsulinand your pancreas might not work as well as it used to. People aged 65 and older are more likely to face diabetes complications, especially heart attacks, eye problems, loss of a leg (amputation), and kidney disease. Let them know if you have any of the common symptoms of type 2 diabetes or if you have questions about type 2 diabetes. It's important to get tested and start treatment early to prevent serious complications. There are many early signs of type 2 diabetes, including being more thirsty than normal, peeing more often, fatigue, and headaches. If you're experiencing new symptoms, talk with your health care provider, even if they seem minor. Many people with the condition don't know they have it. Most people can control their type 2 diabetes symptoms with the right lifestyle changes and medications. How does type 2 diabetes affect your life? If you're diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, you'll need to make certain lifestyle changes to control your symptoms. Your doctor can help you figure out the best diet and exercise routines for you. You may need to begin monitoring your glucose (blood sugar) with an at-home glucose meter each day, especially if you're taking insulin. If you have side effects from any new drugs you take to control your diabetes, talk with your health care provider about your concerns regarding medications. What three drinks should diabetics avoid? Soda, sweet tea, and sports drinks contain lots of added sugar that can spike your glucose levels. Instead, consider opting for water to keep your blood sugar in check.

Type 1 diabetes is a condition in which your immune system destroys insulin-making cells (beta cells) in your pancreas. That means your body can't make enough insulin or any at all. Insulin is a hormone that helps move glucose (sugar) from your blood and into your cells so it can be used for energy. Because type 1 diabetes is often diagnosed in kids and young adults, it used to be called juvenile diabetes. In the past, it was also called insulin-dependent diabetes. Are you born with type 1 diabetes? You can get it at any age. In fact, half of all people now diagnosed with type 1 diabetes are adults. Type 1 diabetes vs. secondary diabetes A condition called secondary diabetes is like type 1, but your insulin-making cells are wiped out by another health condition or an injury to your pancreas, rather than by your immune system. Type 1 diabetes vs. type 2diabetes If you have type 1, your body doesn't make enough insulin. Withtype 2 diabetes, your body can make insulin but can't use it well. The cells in your muscles, fat, and liver build up what's called insulin resistance. With type 1 diabetes, you need to use man-made insulin every day so your body can function. But not everyone with type 2 diabetes needs it. Other medications can help you manage the condition. No matter which type of diabetes you have, you'll need to keep a close eye on your daily habits, such as what you eat and how much activity you get to stay healthy. Keeping a close eye on your blood sugar is a key part of managing diabetes. A continuous glucose monitor lets you check your levels in real time. (Photo Credit: Moment/Getty Images) Symptoms can come on very quickly. They include: Late-onset type 1diabetes symptoms More research is being done on what's calledLatent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults(LADA). Some people refer to this as "Diabetes 1.5" or "Diabetes 1 1/2" because it overlaps with parts of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. LADA symptomscan come on very slowly, making it tricky to diagnose. So does the fact that people who have it are usually at a healthy weight, and often between the ages of 30 and 50 years. Your child is at higher risk of type 1 diabetes if: Type 1 diabetes symptoms in children The signs are the same as for adults, but you may also notice: In some babies or kids, type 1 diabetes can also look like the flu. If you notice any of these symptoms, take your child to the doctor. Experts aren't sure what causes your pancreas to stop making insulin for your body. Your genes and immune system both appear to play big roles. Is type 1 diabetes genetic? To an extent, yes. Once you inherit genes that put you at risk for type 1, an environmental trigger such as an infection, virus, orautoimmune disorder, seems necessary to "switch" them on. When scientists look atthe blood of people with type 1, they can see special proteins that show their immune system is going after their pancreas. Only about 5%-10% of people with diabetes have type 1. The risk factors for it aren't as clear as they are for type 2 diabetes.Â So far, experts only know that youâre more likely to have it if you: If your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, theyâll check your blood sugar levels. This can be done in a few different ways. A1c test.Also called a glycated hemoglobin test, it can figure out your average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months with one small blood sample. It does that by counting the number of hemoglobin (red blood) cells that are sticky with glucose.Â If your A1c result is 6.5% or higher, you'll retake the test. If it's the same number or higher, you likely have diabetes. This test may not give you a correct result if you have any of the following: If you're of African, Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian descent, you could also have a different type of hemoglobin (called a hemoglobin variant) that could skew your A1c result. Let your doctor know if any of these apply to you. If so, they can test your blood sugar in different ways, such asÂ Fasting blood sugar test.In this test, your blood's taken after you haven't eaten overnight. A result of 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or higher on two separate tests signals diabetes. Random blood sugar test.Your blood glucose can also be checked at a random time. Whether or not you've recently eaten, a result of 200 mg/dL or higher means diabetes. Type 1 diabetes test The above tests can show whether you have diabetes, but they can't tell you which type. To find out whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, your doctor will need to look for: Autoantibodies.These are the proteins in your immune system that attack healthy cells, such as beta cells in your pancreas that make insulin. If you have type 1 diabetes, they'll show up in a blood sample. Ketones. When you have type 1, your body relies on acids called ketones for fuel because it doesn't have enough glucose to use. A urine (pee) test can detect them. Across the U.S., type 1 diabetes is on the rise. Hispanic and Black communities are affected more than others. For instance, studies show that if you have brown or black skin, controlling your blood glucose once you're diagnosed is more of a challenge. Black children with type 1 diabetes are also at higher risk ofdepression, diabetes complications, and hospital stays. Structural racism plays a big part in explaining this inequality. Many long-standing laws and policies discriminate against people of color. So do systems such as health care. You can be diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and live a long, healthy life. Keeping a close eye on your blood sugar levels will be key. Your doctor will give you a target range, and making healthy choices daily will help you stay within that range. It's also important to know the symptoms of very high or low blood sugar, and how to treat them. Type 1 diabetes medications You'll also need to use insulin every day. When your doctor talks about insulin, theyâll mention three main things: Several types of insulin are available. Ways to take insulin Insulin doesn't come in pill form, so you'll have to rely on other ways to get it into your body: Insulin injections.Most insulin shots come in a small glass bottle called a vial. You draw it out with a syringe that has a needle on the end and give yourself the shot. Some kinds come in a prefilled pen. Inhaled insulin.Your doctor may prescribe a rapid-acting insulin that you breathe into your mouth through a small device. It's not healthy to use this type if you smoke or have lung issues such as asthma. Insulin pump.This device, which you wear, sends small bursts of insulin into your body throughout the day. It does this through a small tube just under your skin. Your doctor will help you pick the type of insulin and delivery method thatâs best for you. Continuous glucose monitoring Checking your blood sugar throughout the day will help make sure it stays within your target range. Pricking your finger and testing a blood sample with a blood glucose meter is one way to check. Many people also choose to wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). Using a sensor just under your skin, this device can check your glucose every few minutes. Most models will alert you if it goes too high or too low, so you can treat it right away. Other type 1 diabetes medications Based on your health, your doctor could also prescribe: To feel your best, try to: Get enough sleep. It can improve your blood sugar as well as your outlook. If you can, aim for at least 7 hours each night. Babies, kids, and teens will need even more. Manage your stress. It's really common to feel angry or overwhelmed that you have type 1. Find healthy ways to reduce your stress. Talk to trusted friends and family members or ask your doctor to refer you to a counselor or therapist. Quit smoking.Vaping and chewing tobacco are habits to stop, too. All these things narrow yourblood vesselsand put you at risk for other health issues. Talk to your doctor if you're not sure how to quit. Visit your doctor regularly. Regular medical, dental, and eye exams can help you prevent issues, or treat them as soon as they're found. Find ways to be active.Try to find a physical activity you enjoy. Even taking care of your garden counts. Talk to your doctor about how to balance your insulin dose and the food you eat with any activity you do. Type 1 diabetes diet Once you know how carbs, fats, and protein affect your blood sugar, you can build a healthy eating plan that helps keep your levels where they should be. Generally speaking, you'll focus on eating lots of nutrient-rich vegetables, fruits, and whole grains while cutting back on refined carbohydrates, such as white bread or pasta, which quickly raise your blood sugar. No foods is off-limits, but you will need to limit some or enjoy smaller portions than you used to. A diabetes educator or registered dietitian can help you learn to count carbohydrates at each meal and snack. If you're not sure how to connect with these experts, ask your doctor. If your blood sugar isn't well-managed, it can lead to other health issues, including: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).If your body can't get enough glucose for fuel, it breaks down fat cells instead. This creates chemicals called ketones. Your liver releases the sugar it stores to help out. But your body canât use it without insulin, so it builds up in your blood, along with the acidic ketones. This mix of extra glucose, dehydration, and acid buildup is known as ketoacidosis and can be life-threatening if not treated right away. Heart disease.Diabetes can put you at higher risk ofblood clots, high blood pressure, and cholesterol. These can lead to chest pain, heart attack, stroke, or heart failure. Skin conditions.You're more likely to get blisters and rashes, as well as bacterial or fungal infections. Gum disease.A dry mouth, increased plaque, and poor blood flow can all cause mouth issues. Pregnancy complications.Type 1 diabetes raises your risk of early delivery, birth defects, stillbirth, andpreeclampsia. Retinopathy.This eye issue happens in about 80% of adults who have had type 1 diabetes for more than 15 years. To prevent it and to keep your eyesight,you'll need to control your blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Kidney damage.About 20%-30% of people with type 1 diabetes get a condition called nephropathy. The chance of getting it goes up over time. Itâs most likely to show up 15-25 years after the onset of diabetes. It can lead to other serious problems such as kidney failure and heart disease. Poor blood flow and nerve damage.Damaged nerves and hardened arteries lead to a loss of feeling in, and a lack of blood supply to, your feet. This raises your chances of injury and makes it harder for open sores and wounds to heal. When that happens, you could lose a limb. Nerve damage can also cause digestive problems such as nausea, vomiting, anddiarrhea. Exciting new treatments in the works include: Glucose monitoring without needle sticks.This is proving to be a challenge for scientists. Continuous ketone monitor (CKM). Like a CGM, a wearable device would monitor the fluid between your cells. Longer-acting insulin. For instance, one type would keep your blood glucose steady for a week. Immunotherapy.Some experts are looking for ways to "switch off" your immune system so it stops attacking the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. "New" beta cells.One early-stage Australian study was able to get pancreatic stem cells to make insulin. If testing pans out, your remaining pancreas cells may be treated one day to start makinginsulinagain. Keep up with new research on type 1 diabetes through a trusted organization such as the CDC or the American Diabetes Association. Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong condition. A diagnosis may feel overwhelming, but you can learn to manage your blood sugar. Making healthy choices every day will be key.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition in which your immune system mistakenly destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. This leads to high blood sugar. Most children with type 1 diabetes are diagnosed around age 5 or in early puberty. (Photo Credit: E+/Getty Images) It's the most commonchronic conditionaffecting kids in the U.S. Your child could get type 1 diabetes at any age, but most people are diagnosed around age 5 or in early puberty (10-14 years old). White children of non-Hispanic descent are at a higher risk of getting it than other kids. Boys and people assigned male at birth are at a slightly higher risk than girls or people assigned female at birth. The classic symptoms of type 1 diabetes in children is excessive thirst and hunger, peeing a lot, and losing weight even though they seem to be eating well. These symptoms may start out mild then get worse over days, weeks, or months. But it's more likely to be a shorter period in children than adults who develop type 1 diabetes. High blood sugar can becomediabetes-related ketoacidosis(DKA) fast in kids. DKA can be life-threatening, so it's essential you get them to the ER right away in that case. Symptoms include fruity-smelling breath, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing, and drowsiness. Read on to learn more about the symptoms of type 1 diabetes so you can know when to get them to the doctor for testing. Type 1 diabetes is caused by anautoimmune conditionthat destroys the insulin-making beta cells in your pancreas. This means your body makes very little or no insulin at all. Because you have little or no insulin to tell your cells to take up sugar from your blood, you get high blood sugar. You will need to monitor your blood sugar every day and take insulin injections. You can be diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at any age, but people tend to be diagnosed more often between ages 5 and 7 or around puberty. It's one of the most frequently diagnosed chronic (lifelong) conditions in children. For this reason, doctors used to call it juvenile diabetes.Type 1 DiabetesÂis slightly more common in boys and people assigned male at birth. This is unlike most autoimmune conditions, which are generally more common in people assigned female at birth. You may be more familiar with type 2 diabetes. About 90%-95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is most commonly diagnosed after age 45, although anyone can get it, including children. People with type 2 diabetes usually make a lot of insulin, but their tissues become insulin resistant. This means that their tissues stop responding to insulin very well. So they wind up with high blood sugar, even though they make plenty of insulin. Experts think that this may be partly due to eating a lot of highly processed foods, carrying extra weight, and a lack of exercise. In the U.S., about 1.25 million people are currently living with type 1 diabetes, and about 500,000 of these people are children. Worldwide, type 1 diabetes diagnoses have raised by 200%-300% in the past 20-30 years. But researchers aren't exactly sure why that is. One idea is that people are exposed to fewer infections when they're younger now than they used to be. This is called the "hygiene hypothesis." Getting exposed to more infections at a younger age may train your immune system to better tell the difference between an invader and your own tissues. That may help protect you against developing some autoimmune conditions, like asthma and type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition. At some point before you get symptoms, you develop at least two antibodies to the beta cells in your pancreas. Your pancreas is a large gland in your upper belly. It makes enzymes to help you digest your food and two hormones to help regulate your blood sugar: insulin and glucagon. When your blood sugar goes high, specific cells in your pancreas called beta cells make insulin to help lower it. When your blood sugar goes low, specific cells called alpha cells makeglucagonto raise it back up. The antibodies (called autoantibodies because they are against your own tissues) your body makes mistake your beta cells for microbe invaders. Thus, they begin to attack and kill these cells. People who develop these autoantibodies have a genetic predisposition to develop them. Researchers have found more than 50 genes that seem to contribute to the risk of type 1 diabetes in children. But one specific group of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system seems to contribute about 40% of this risk. The HLA system works to help your immune system tell the difference between foreign invaders and your own tissues. Several other autoimmune conditions are also linked to mutations in the HLA system, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and psoriasis. About 90% of children with type 1 diabetes have the HLA system variants DR4-DQ8 and DR3-DQ2. If you have the genetic predisposition for type 1 diabetes, you won't necessarily develop it because you also need an environmental trigger. Experts don't really know for sure what this environmental trigger is, but it's likely to be a combination of factors. Such factors include: Eventually, after most of your beta cells have been killed off by the autoantibodies, you will start to develop high blood sugars because you can't make enough insulin to keep it in balance. Although you likely won't have symptoms until your blood sugar has been high for awhile. It can take years from the time you develop autoantibodies to when you begin having high blood sugar. Although the process can be fast, too. It's more likely to be a fast process in children. The risk factors for type 1 diabetes in children include: Family history Most people who develop type 1 diabetes have no family history of it. But if your mom has it, your risk to develop it is about 1%-4%, while if your dad has it, your risk is about 3%-8%. If both your parents have it, your risk goes up to about 30%. If one of your children has it, your other kids have about a 5% risk of it, unless they're twins. If they're fraternal twins, the risk that the other twin will develop it is about 10%. The risk is about 40%-50% for identical twins. Because the link with family history is so strong, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that first-degree (parents and siblings) and second-degree (aunt, uncle, grandparent, grandchild, niece, nephew, or half-sibling) relatives of people with type 1 diabetes should be screened with an autoantibody test. Ethnicity White children of non-Hispanic descent seem to be at a higher risk than other children to develop type 1 diabetes. Sex Boys and people assigned male at birth seem to have a slightly higher risk than girls and people assigned female at birth. Geography People in the northern hemisphere seem to be at a higher risk than other people. The highest reported incidence of people with type 1 diabetes is in Finland and other countries in Northern Europe, while the lowest incidence is in China and Venezuela. In Finland, about 60 people are diagnosed for every 100,000 people they observe for a year (person years). In China, this is about 0.1 person per 100,000 person years. And in the U.S., about 20-30 people are diagnosed for every 100,000 person years. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes in children may start out mild and then get worse over a period. This could be over days, weeks, or months. But it's more likely to be a shorter period in children. These symptoms may include: People with type 1 diabetes who aren't getting enough insulin can develop something known as DKA when their blood sugar goes too high. This is a medical emergency. If your child has any of the following symptoms, call 911 and get them to the ER right away: To diagnose your child with diabetes, their doctor will do a blood glucose test and may do a 75-gram oral glucose test (OGTT) or an A1c test. This may be after fasting (no food or drink for eight hours before your test) or random (without fasting). They'll be diagnosed if they meet two of the following criteria: Your doctor will likely suspect type 1 based on your child's medical and family history, but once they're diagnosed, their doctor will likely run an antibody test to confirm it's type 1. For instance, they can test for autoantibodies to the following: Most people who have type 1 diabetes will have at least one of these autoantibodies in their blood. The more your child has and the higher their levels, the more likely they are to develop (or have) type 1 diabetes. Their doctor can also test their C-peptide levels.C-peptideis protein that helps insulin fold into the right structure so it can do it's job. If your child has no or very low C-peptide levels, it means that their pancreas isn't making insulin or is only making a little. Their doctor may also run some tests to check on their general health and to make sure you they don't have DKA. These tests usually include a basic metabolic panel, a urinalysis, and an arterial blood gas measurement. They may also screen your child for other autoimmune conditions that are associated with diabetes, such as celiac and thyroid disease. Your pediatrician or family physician will likely recommend your child see a pediatricendocrinologistwho specializes in managing kids with type 1 diabetes. Your child will need insulin injections several times a day every day to live and feel healthy. Your child's diabetes management strategy will have to be personalized to their body, life, and activity levels, and their endocrinologist will help them do that. Your child's doctor may also suggest they see a nurse, diabetes educator, dietician, social worker, or psychologist, depending on your child's needs, what your insurance covers, and what specialists are available in your area. In general, type 1 diabetes management includes: Blood sugar monitoring Your child will need to monitor their blood sugar throughout the day every day. It's usually done with a blood glucose meter, which is a fairly easy and inexpensive option to get a one-time blood reading at the time they tested. These use a small drop of blood from a finger stick on a test strip. In the past 10 years or so, continuousglucose monitoring(CGM) devices have become available. You or the doctor will insert a small sensor under your skin. These provide much more information about your glucose levels. Your child's endocrinologist will give them a target blood glucose level based on their individual needs and lifestyle and will work with them and you to come up with a plan to meet those targets. Insulin injections This is the key part of your child's diabetes management plan. Your child will take their insulin with multiple daily injections (MDIs), an insulin pen, or an insulin pump (also called continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion). If they take MDIs, your child will likely need more than one type of insulin. There are dozens of types available on the market that work at different speeds and over different periods. For instance, they will need a basal insulin injection once or twice a day to keep a background level of insulin in their blood. Then, they will need several bolus insulin injections at mealtimes to keep their blood sugar from going too high. If they use aninsulin pump, their pump will deliver rapid-acting basal insulin, often based on input from a CGM device. Then they may use their pump to deliver the bolus insulin they need at mealtimes. Your child's insulin needs will change depending on a lot of different factors, such as what types of foods they eat, how much of it they eat, what their blood sugar level was before they eat, or if they're sick or taking medicines. This is why it's important to see a specialist who can help them figure out a good management strategy. Carbohydrate counting The ADA recommends a consultation with a dietician to help learn about how to eat a healthy diet as a person with diabetes. In general, experts recommend your child's daily energy intake (calories) should be: Yourchild's dieticianwill help you learn how to calculate the carbohydrates in a food based on a healthy portion size. This is an essential skill for your child to master so they can calculate how much insulin they need on a daily basis. Type 1 diabetes can be challenging to manage consistently over the course of a lifetime. A helpful goal to focus on as the parent is to help your child build their skills so they can manage their diabetes on their own and stay healthy. Here are some tips to focus on as you support your child while they learn how to manage their condition: If your child hasn't been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes but they are having symptoms like excessive thirst and hunger, peeing a lot, and losing weight, they need to go to the doctor to be tested. If your child has already been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, call your doctor if you notice any of these signs of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia): Low blood sugar can be life-threatening and needs to be treated right away. If your child loses consciousness or hasseizures, call 911 and get them to the ER right away. Also, if your child has symptoms of DKA, call 911 and get them to the ER right away: Type 1 diabetes is caused by anautoimmune conditionthat destroys the insulin-making beta cells in your pancreas. It causes high blood sugar. It's a lifelong condition that causes high blood sugar. Management requires insulin replacement, a careful diet, and blood sugar monitoring. But with the right education and support, your child can learn to manage their diabetes and live and long and fulfilling life. Can children grow out of type 1 diabetes? No, children can't outgrow type 1 diabetes. Once the beta cells in their pancreas have stopped making insulin, there is no way to repair that damage. But they can learn to manage their condition so that they live a healthy and fulfilling life. And new progress is made in treatment all the time. For instance, in the past 10-15 years, insulin pumps and CGM devices have become more widely used. These tools can help make their life a little easier. Can children with type 1 diabetes live a normal life? Yes, children with type 1 diabetes can look forward to a long, healthy, and fulfilling life. They may need to take more care with their health â and they may need a bit more support â than kids without diabetes, but it's a manageable condition. With the right care plan and support, there's no reason they can't live healthy, happy lives. SOURCES Los, E.Type 1 Diabetes in Children, StatPearls Publishing, 2023.

For those withdiabetes, aninsulinshot delivers medicine into the subcutaneous tissue -- the tissue between yourskinand muscle. Subcutaneous tissue (also called "sub Q" tissue) is found throughout your body. Please follow these steps when using an insulin syringe.Note: these instructions are not for patients using an insulin pen or a non-needle injection system. Select a clean, dry work area, and gather the following insulin supplies: Wash hands with soap and warm water and dry them with a clean towel. If you've been prescribed two types of insulin to be taken at once (mixed dose), skip to the instructions in the next section. Your doctor may prescribe two types of insulin to be injected at once for diabetes. This mixed dose may provide betterblood sugarcontrol for some people. Please follow these steps when injecting a mixed dose of insulin: Important:This must be an exact measurement. If you withdraw too much cloudy insulin, the total dosage in the syringe must be discarded. Be careful not to push any of the clear insulin from the syringe into the cloudy insulin. If there are large air bubbles after mixing the insulin in the syringe, discard this dosage and start the procedure again. Do not push the insulin back into the bottle. Because you will be injecting insulin on a regular basis for diabetes, you need to know where to inject it and how to rotate (move) your injection sites. By rotating your injection sites, you will make yourinjectionseasier, safer, and more comfortable. If the same injection site is used over and over again, you may develop hardened areas under the skin that keep the insulin from being used properly. Important:Only use the sites on the front of your body for self-injection. Any of the sites may be used if someone else is giving you the injection. Follow these guidelines: Choose an injection site for your insulin shot. Do not inject near joints, thegroinarea, navel, the middle of the abdomen, or near scars. Clean the injection site (about 2 inches of your skin) in a circular motion with an alcohol wipe or a cotton ball dampened with rubbing alcohol. Leave the alcohol wipe or cotton ball nearby. Using the hand you write with, hold the barrel of the syringe (with the needle end down) like a pen, being careful not to put your finger on the plunger. Do not cap the needle. Drop the entire syringe and needle into your container for used "sharps" equipment. When the container is full, put the lid or cover on it and throw it away with the trash. Do NOT put this container in the recycling bin. Some communities have specific disposal laws. Check with your local health department for specific disposal instructions in your community.

It's important to eat a healthy diet when you havetype 1 diabetes. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy tasty food, including some of your favorites. With type 1 diabetes, your body stops making insulin. So you take insulin every day, either through shots or a pump. Itâs also key to track your blood sugar levels. Insulin is only part of the picture. Diet and exercise also play important roles in helping keep your blood sugar levels stable. When you make healthy food choices and eat consistent amounts throughout the day, it can help control your sugars. It can also lower your chance of diabetes-related problems like heart disease, kidney disease, andnerve damage. Some experts used to think there was a "diabetes diet." They thought people with diabetes had to avoid all foods with sugars or stop eating certain other foods. But when you have type 1, you can eat the same healthy diet as everyone else. Follow some general guidelines: Â Those high-fiber foods are always better choices than low-fiber carbs such as refined 'white' grains and processed sugary foods. Carbohydratesare your body's main source of energy. You get them from many foods, like grains (pasta, bread, crackers, and cookies), fruits and vegetables, dairy products, and sugars. Carbs raise your blood sugar levels faster than any food. How many and what type of carbohydrate foods you eat can affect how well you manage your diabetes. Counting carbs helps you keep track of how many carbs you eat. You can work with your doctor or a dietitian to figure out how many grams of carbs you should eat for each meal and snack. You can use the food label, a food exchange app, or other reference to count up the grams of carbs in foods. Some people think sugar "causes" diabetes. But type 1 is caused by genetics and other factors. Still, many sweet foods have a lot of carbs, and that can affect your blood sugar. If a food is "sugar free," that doesn't mean it also has fewer carbs or calories. Read the label so you can count how many carbs you're getting. You may want to consider foods and drinks that uselow-calorieor artificial sweeteners. They can satisfy your sweet tooth without the extra carbs and calories. The American Diabetes Association suggests you eat these tasty items. They're low in carbs (also known as low glycemic index foods). And they're high in key nutrients like calcium, potassium, fiber, magnesium, and other vitamins.

Gestational diabetesis high blood sugar that you get only when you're pregnant. The word "gestational" means the time when the baby grows in the womb. In the U.S., it's estimated that 6Â out of every 100 pregnant women have this disease. You can get it even if you didn't have diabetes before your pregnancy. Good blood sugar control is important for your health and your babyâs. The first step in managing it is to understand what causes gestational diabetes. When you eat, your body breaks down carbohydrates from foods into a sugar called glucose. The sugar goes into your bloodstream. From there, it travels to your cells to give your body energy. An organ called the pancreas makes a hormone called insulin, which helps move sugar into your cells and lower the amount in your blood. During pregnancy, the placenta -- the organ that feeds and delivers oxygen to your baby -- releases hormones that help your baby grow. Some of these make it harder for your body to make or use insulin. This is calledinsulin resistance. To keep your blood sugar levels steady, your pancreas has to make more insulin -- as much as three times more than usual. If it can't make enough extra insulin, your blood sugar will rise and you'll get gestational diabetes. You may be more likely to get this disease if: Gestational diabetes usually starts in the beginning of the third trimester. However, if you have some risk factors, your doctor may recommend an early glucose test around the end of the first trimester. It is repeated again between 24-28 weeks of pregnancy, and if you test negative then, you won't be tested again. For the test, a laboratory technician will check your blood sugar after you drink a sugary drink. Work with your doctor to lower your blood sugar during pregnancy. Depending on your test results, this might mean diet changes or medicine. When you keep your blood sugar under control, your baby will be less likely to have diabetes, be born at a heavier-than-normal weight, or have other health problems.

As many as 9 out of every 100 pregnant women will develop a condition known asgestational diabetesmellitus (GDM). It can put you at risk for problems duringpregnancyand delivery. When you're pregnant, your cells become slightly more resistant toinsulin. This causes the amount of glucose or sugar in yourbloodto rise. The extra sugar helps make more nutrients available to yourbaby. But if your cells become too resistant and the glucose can't into them, your blood sugar level becomes too high. It can cause problems for you and your growing baby. Although some things mean you're more likely to get it, you can steps to lower your risk. No one can say for sure who will have gestational diabetes, but your chances go up if you: Talk to your doctor about how likely you are to get it and what symptoms to watch for. Your doctor or a nutritionist can help you choose foods that may keep yourblood glucosewithin a healthy range. They can also teach you about ideal portions and meal timing. In general, limit sweets and track how many carbohydrate-rich foods you eat. Include fiber in your meals. This can come from vegetables, fruits, whole-grain breads, whole-grain crackers, and cereals. One large study looked at diets of women before they got pregnant. Each daily increase in fiber by 10 grams reduced their risk of gestational diabetes by 26%. In addition to what you eat, taking fiber supplements may be helpful in helping you reach your fiber intake needs. Check with your doctor before taking any supplements. Getting regularexercise, if your condition allows it, can help keep your glucose levels healthy. Walking andswimmingare good choices. In one study, researchers found that women who were physically active before and during their pregnancy -- about 4 hours a week -- lowered their risk of gestational diabetes by about 70% or even more. Check with your doctor about how much and how often you should exercise. It depends upon your overall health. Some of the same risk factors that put you in danger of getting gestational diabetes also make you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life. And if you have gestational diabetes, your risk oftype 2 diabetesafter your pregnancy rises. After your baby is born, follow the same healthy diet and exercise plan. Getting back to a healthy weight will also lower your risk. But you don't have to worry about fitting into your "skinny jeans" again right away. When you'reoverweight, losing 5% to 7% of your body weight helps: If you weigh 180 pounds, losing just 9 pounds makes a difference. Bonus: Shedding those pregnancy pounds will get you in better shape for being an active mother. SOURCES: CDC: "Diabetes & Pregnancy." Dempsey, J.American Journal of Epidemiology, April 1, 2004.

All pregnant women should be screened forgestational diabetesduring their pregnancy. Screening may be done by taking the woman's medical history and examining certain risk factors, but anoral glucose tolerance testis also recommended. The oral glucose tolerance test is used to screen for gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is a specifictype of diabetesthat can develop in some women late in pregnancy (usually after the 24th week). Women who develop this complication do not have diabetes before becoming pregnant. The test is generally given between the 24th and 28th week of pregnancy. If you have had gestational diabetes before, or if your health care provider is concerned about your risk of developing gestationaldiabetes, the test may be performed before the 13th week of pregnancy. The oral glucose tolerance test involves quickly drinking a sweetened liquid (called Glucola), which contains 50g of glucose. The body absorbs this glucose rapidly, causingbloodglucose levelsto rise within 30 to 60 minutes. A blood sample will be taken from a vein in your arm about 60 minutes after drinking the solution. The blood test measures how the glucose solution was metabolized (processed by the body). Ablood glucoselevel of 140mg/dL or higher will identify 80% of women with gestational diabetes. When that cutoff is lowered to 130mg/dL, the identification increases to 90%. If your blood glucose level was greater than 130 mg/dL, your provider will likely recommend you take another diabetes screening test that requires you to fast (not eat anything) before the test.Â During this second test, called the 100-gram oral glucose tolerance test, your blood glucose level will be tested four times during a three-hour period after drinking the sweetened (many flavors are available) cola-like drink. If two out of the four blood tests are abnormal, you are considered to have gestational diabetes.

If you havegestational diabetes, you'll need to get yourblood sugarunder control, and keep it that way, to protect your health and your baby's. Youâll have to make some lifestyle changes for that to happen. Your doctor might suggest you meet with a registered dietitian to help you make adiet planyou can stick with. It will need to address the gestational diabetes, but still provide your growing baby enough calories andnutrients. Your dietitian will recommend the number of totaldaily caloriesa woman your height and weight should get. About 2,200 to 2,500 calories per day is the norm for women ofaverage weight. If youâre overweight, you may need to lower that to about 1,800 calories per day. The dietitian can teach you how to balance your diet. Theyâll probably suggest you get: Your doctor may tell you to add exercise to your weekly routine if itâs OK for you and the baby. Try to do some kind of mild to moderate activity for 15 minutes or half an hour on most days. This will help your body useinsulinbetter, and that helps controlblood sugar levels. Follow your doctor's instructions about how muchexerciseis right for you. Make sure the diet changes and added exercise get your blood sugar levels under control. Test your levels regularly, before meals and 1 or 2 hours after meals. If you donât already have abloodglucose meterto use at home, your doctor will probably give you one and teach you how to use it. If your blood sugar remains high despite these changes, the doctor may prescribe diabetes pills to keep it in check and protect your baby. If they donât do the job, the next step may beinsulininjections. Depending on how well-controlled yourdiabetesis and how your pregnancy is progressing, the doctor may track your babyâs size more closely during the last weeks or months before yourdue date. TheyÂ might request anultrasoundif the baby appears to be growing very large. While most women with gestational diabetes are able to have a normal labor andvaginal delivery, some doctors prefer to deliver the baby earlier than the due date. Yours may suggest acesarean sectionif the baby grows too large. After delivery, the doctor will check to make sure your blood sugar levels have returned to normal. You'll need to have your levels rechecked about 6 weeks after delivery, and then yearly after that.

Aug. 19, 2025 â Type 1 diabetes cases are rising faster than ever â up42% in three decadesâ with sharp increases amongU.S. children and teens. But new and emerging treatments are surging too, as experts say we're now in the most promising era yet.Â "These patients are living much longer than they used to with an improved quality of life," said Kupper A. Wintergerst, MD, a pediatric endocrinologist and executive director of the Wendy Novak Diabetes Institute,Â a part of Norton Children's Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky.Â Genetics can increase a person'sÂrisk by 40%, but experts say the environment may play a role in triggering the autoimmune condition, which happens when the immune system mistakenly attacks insulin-producing beta cells. These things in the environment include early-childhoodÂinfections(like mumps, rubella, and influenza B), childhood obesity, antibiotics overuse, vitamin D deficiency, and the hygiene hypothesis, which suggests that limited microbial exposure in early life may lead to an overactive immune system. Another possibility: Certain chemicals found in our food andÂwater supplyâ including PFAS (often called "forever chemicals"), dioxins, and arsenic â may promote inflammation, adding to the immune system mistakenly attacking and destroying its own beta cells. Over time, this lack of beta cells causes the body to stop producing its own insulin, and blood sugar begins to rise.Â Researchers are responding with advanced treatment strategies, including new medications that not only control blood sugar but actually slow the disease. From smarter insulin delivery systems, to inhalable insulin, to new drugs that improve how the body responds to insulin â patients have more tools than ever to manage the condition, and advances have tripled the number of patients living past 65 in the last four decades.Â Slowing Progression of the DiseaseÂ Though often diagnosed in childhood, type 1 diabetes can develop at any age â and a new medication calledÂteplizumabÂ(Tzield) has been shown to delay its start by two to three years. It's given to patients in early, stages of the disease, before there are symptoms. Patients who've tested positive for two or more type 1 diabetes-related autoantibodies are considered good candidates, as are those with abnormal blood sugar levels but no other symptoms yet. The medication, which must be started weeks or months after diagnosis, binds to CD3 proteins on the surface of white blood cells, helping to block the autoimmune attack. While not right for all patients, it can be helpful particularly for children.Â "This medication can help prolong the beta cell function that is remaining and decrease how much insulin a person needs," saidÂBethany L. Gottesman, MD, a pediatric endocrinologist at Phoenix Children's in Arizona. Because the drug requires a daily infusion for 14 straight days, patients need access to an infusion center that offers services over the weekend. These are available throughout the country â including Barbara Davis Center for DiabetesÂ in Aurora, Colorado;Â UNC Children's HospitalÂ in Chapel Hill, North Carolina;Â Children's HealthÂ in Dallas and Plano, Texas; Nicklaus Children's HospitalÂ in Miami, Florida; and the Wendy Novak Diabetes Institute in Louisville, Kentucky.Â Contact theÂTZIELD COMPASS Support ProgramÂ to find a center near you.Â What's next?Now that researchers know how to slow the disease, the next step is preserving beta cell function indefinitely. Lab-grown beta cells (derived from stem cells) could be put into the body to replace those destroyed by the immune system, potentially reducing or stopping the need for insulin shots. One such treatment called zimislecel has shown promise inearly trials, and if all goes to plan, Vertex (its maker) expects to submit for regulatory approvalin 2026. Another possibility on the horizon could beislet cell transplantation, which uses donor cells instead of lab-grown stem cells. Improved Insulin Delivery SystemsÂ Advances in wearable technology and computer programming have revolutionized insulin delivery systems, which now do a much better job of mimicking the pancreas. Continuous glucose monitors, worn on the body, measure sugar levels in the fluid between cells. This data can be sent to an insulin pump, which automatically adjusts insulin delivery to keep blood sugar in a healthy range.Â Experts say these more optimized systems help patients deal with diabetic burnout â the mental and physical exhaustion that results from the demands of dietary restrictions and glucose monitoring. The issue is especially harmful for children who are new to the disease and facing a lifetime of blood sugar management, saidÂMichael Yafi, MD, a pediatric endocrinologist and associateÂprofessor at McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston.Â Still, the systems are not perfect â they require the user to input the size of a meal or the amount of carbohydrates they're consuming in order to predict whether blood sugar will go up or down, which can make it harder for young children to use them. What's next?Future systems aim to beÂfully automated, handling all dosing decisions without manual input. Someday they may also be able toÂlearn individual patterns, like how a person's body responds to food, exercise, and stress. At the same time, continuous glucose monitors are expected to become even smaller and more discreet â all part of a shift toward helping patients manage their type 1 diabetes with less effort and greater quality of life. Inhaled Insulin for Both Kids and AdultsÂ After decades ofÂfalse starts, inhaled insulin is finally gaining meaningful traction, with moreÂstudiesbacking its benefits. Research shows that Afrezza â the only inhaled insulin on the market today â provides rapid insulin delivery, starting to lower blood sugar in aboutÂ12 to 15 minutes. While not a replacement for basal insulin (type 1 diabetes still requires shots or an insulin pump for steady, continuous management), it can provide a helpful boost of insulin after meals or workouts. Because it works fast â in and out of the body in aboutÂan hour and a half to three hoursâ it may helpÂreducethe risk ofÂreactive hypoglycemia, low blood sugar after a meal. For example, it may benefit those who carb-load before exercise, helping process the carbs without lingering too long and causing lows after the workout.Â Unlike earlier versions of inhaled insulin â like Exubera, which maker PfizerÂpulled from the market in 2007after the product failed to catch on â Afrezza uses a special technology that allows it to be more compact and better tolerated (though coughing remains a side effect). Developed by Mannkind Corporation (Afrezza's maker), theÂtechnologyinvolves tiny particles that hold the insulin inside and are just the right size to be breathed into the lungs. When you inhale the powder, it dissolves quickly, allowing it to be absorbed into the bloodstream rapidly. In studies, many patients say they like inhaled insulin, citing convenience and ease of use. It's also discreet for children who are embarrassed or don't want to inject themselves in public places, like at school. AÂrecent pediatric trialinvolving patients ages 4 to 17 found that children and parents preferred Afrezza slightly more than shots. While the product is currently only FDA-approved for adults, approval for children is expected later this year. Still, inhaled insulin does have drawbacks, saidÂGottesman. "It's not meant to be used if you have lung disease, and some pediatric patients have asthma," she said. "This is also true of older patients with type 1 diabetes, who are more likely to have other lung diseases." Unlike rapid acting injections, Afrezza doesn't allow for exact dosing. It's only available inÂfixed-size cartridgesâ amounts that may not be titrated precisely enough for the youngest patients.Â What's next?Newer versions of inhaled insulin are in development. Aerami Therapeutics is working on a liquid formulation â a mist delivered via inhaler â meant to cause less respiratory irritation than Afrezza's dry-powder version. There's no indication when it could be ready for the public. GLP-1s for Type 1 Diabetes With Insulin ResistanceÂ The difference might seem clear: In type 1 diabetes, the problem is lack of insulin production. In type 2, it's insulin resistance â the body still makes insulin but can't use it well.Â But many people with type 1 diabetes, including children, develop insulin resistance, too. Despite lacking natural insulin, their bodies become resistant to the insulin theydoreceive, for reasons including excess weight, medications, smoking, puberty, and pregnancy. When this happens, patients may need to increase their insulin dose. This has led researchers to explore treatments once thought to be reserved only for type 2 diabetes âÂ including GLP-1 agonists like Ozempic and Wegovy â to help patients drop excess weight and stave off or improve insulin resistance, saidÂAlexandra De Lellis, a nurse practitioner atParkview Endocrinology in Fort Wayne, Indiana.Â "Insulin resistance plays a large role, especially for type 1 patients diagnosed in adulthood but also those who were diagnosed younger," said De Lellis. Patients can get frustrated when they feel their insulin isn't having the impact it should because the body is resisting it.Â A study published this year inÂFrontiers in Endocrinologyfound that GLP-1s were a "potential adjunctive therapy in T1D to reduce weight and improve insulin resistance." Studies have shown that GLP-1s can reduce A1c levels by betweenÂ0.21% and 0.96%in patients with type 1 diabetes, while also lowering body weight and reducing insulin needs â particularly in those with insulin resistance. What's next?Larger trials areÂneededto confirm the benefits of GLP-1s as an adjunct in type 1 diabetes care. Future studies could help researchers identify which patients would benefit most, and better understand theÂsafety in younger patientslike adolescents. SOURCES: FDA: "Drug Trials Snapshots: TZIELD."

To manage type 2 diabetes, you need a strategy that includes eating a healthy diet, exercising, taking any medicine your doctor has prescribed, keeping an eye on your blood sugar levels, and counting on a culturally competent care team. Care providers who are culturally competent understand that their patients come from diverse cultures and backgrounds. Culturally competent providers acknowledge conscious and unconscious biases so they can take steps to overcome them. They are also willing to adapt medical care to each personâs social, cultural, and linguistic needs. You know youâre in good hands if your doctor offers you a medical interpreter before you even ask for one. A culturally competent doctor speaks directly to you, not to the interpreter, and makes sure to set a pace that lets the interpreter do the job well. A culturally competent doctor also makes sure youâre comfortable with and understand all the information youâve received. The people who work in your doctorâs office are warm and helpful. Your doctor makes sure to employ people who are Hispanic or bilingual so Spanish-speaking patients feel comfortable and well cared for. Your doctor makes an effort to communicate with you in Spanish or offers a medical interpreter to you so you can follow your treatment plan correctly. Your doctorâs office has bilingual or Spanish-language forms available, so you can easily figure out what information your doctor needs from you. Your doctor also has medical literature, educational materials, and brochures about type 2 diabetes translated into Spanish so you can stay on top of what you need to keep your blood sugar under control. Your doctorâs office offers evening hours, so you donât have to miss work every time you have an appointment. Your doctor also offers virtual visits when it makes sense and sees patients in the order they check in instead of at fixed appointment times. Your doctor recommends other Spanish-speaking health professionals, such as a diabetes care and education specialist. This type of specialist can provide you with the information you need to monitor your blood sugar daily and answer any questions you have about insulin and other diabetes medications. Your doctor recommends helpful resources for Spanish-speaking patients, such as recipes for healthy versions of your favorite dishes and support groups for Spanish speakers. Your doctor doesnât make assumptions about you just because youâre Hispanic. Your doctor also takes the time to understand your specific financial situation, work schedule, and time constraints and makes recommendations that work for you. Culturally competent doctors understand the stigma attached to mental health issues in the Hispanic community. Even if it makes sense for you to talk with a mental health professional, your doctor understands that it might be difficult for you. A culturally competent doctor wonât pressure you if youâre not ready to take that step. Your doctor always makes you feel heard and respected. During appointments, your doctor takes your needs and concerns into account. Your doctor never makes assumptions about you, especially about your culture, race, or ethnicity. Your doctor never stereotypes you in any way or makes comments that make you feel uncomfortable.

A small handful of them -- about 1.5 ounces -- can pack a big nutritional punch with a low carb count. Tossbackalmonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, macadamia nuts, cashews, pistachios, or peanuts for a high-fibersnack full of healthy fats. (Just be sure to hold the salt!) Low-fattypes like cottage cheese, ricotta cheese, or mozzarella are high-protein choices that help keep your blood sugar in check. Enjoy a quarter-cup of cottage cheese with a half-cup of fruit, a piece of low-fat string cheese, or ricotta spread on whole-grain crackers. Yes, it has carbs, but your body digests them slowly. That means they arenât absorbed as quickly as other carbs and wonât spike your blood sugar. The chickpeas in hummus give it lots of fiber and protein to fill you up. Use a third of a cup as a dip for veggies or to spread on whole-grain crackers. A scrambled egg white is good for a quick protein fix at home. Or hard-boil a few to keep in the fridge as on-the-go snacks. Mix some fresh fruit into plain low-fatyogurtfor a sweet treat thatâs light on carbs and a great pre-workout snack. Or if you have a savory tooth, stir in soup mix and use as a dip for veggies or low-salt pretzels. Put 3 cups of the air-popped kind into a sandwich bag as a grab-and-go option that doesnât overload on carbs. With a dash of salt, itâs the perfect savory crunch for an afternoon pick-me-up. It's yummy as-is, but you can also spruce it up for a kick. Mash three avocados, add some salsa,cilantro, and a little lime juice, and voila: guacamole. Keep your serving size to a quarter-cup for a snack that has less than 20 grams of carbs. Half a cup of it paired with four soda crackers is a tasty snack that wonât break the blood sugar bank.

A juicy cheeseburger should be only an occasional treat. Ditch the high-carb buns or ask for the meat patties wrapped inlettuce. Youâll keep the flavor and protein, but little to no empty carbs. If bread is a must, try eating your burger with just one bun instead of two. Go easy on ketchup, mayo, and other condiments. Itâs easy to drink your carbs. Regular soft drinks, sweetened teas, and milkshakes can soak up your daily carb allowance. Opt for water (you can flavor it withlemonor other fresh fruit). Try your specialty coffee drink withalmond milk, which has half the carbs of a 2% cowâs milk. Eggs are naturally carb-free. They also pack protein to help ward off a growling tummy. So order eggs on their own, or mixed with spinach, tomatoes, and other veggies. Go with all egg whites and youâll also save oncholesterol. Just watch out if theyâre served along with muffins, croissants, pancakes, and other high-carb companions.Â In the mood for Mexican or Southwestern fare? Try a salad bowl instead of burritos. Feel free to load up on health-friendly ingredients like: Go easy on black or refried beans, sour cream, and chips. Itâs when you limit yourself to less than half of the daily recommended 130 grams of carbohydrates. So you eat just 20 to 60 grams each day by cutting out unhealthy and processed carbs. They raise your blood sugar levels more quickly than protein and fats do. Cutting back may help keep your insulin levels steady, yourtype 2 diabetesin check, and lower your blood pressure.Â Talk about a carb bomb. A large order of fries may have your whole dayâs allotment for a low-carb diet. Onion rings or waffle fries arenât much better, either. Order a healthier side like a salad, fruit, oryogurt. Any piece of chicken -- breast, drumstick, thigh, or wing -- has 0 carbs as long as itâs not breaded. So go with poultry items that say âgrilledâ instead of âfried,â âcrispy,â or are coated with buttermilk. Watch what you dip your fries into or slather on your meats. Ketchup has more carbs than mayonnaise. Regular mustard is a better pick thanhoneymustard. And hot or chili sauces usually have less sugar and carbs than barbecue sauce. They can make for filling, healthy-carb meals. Chicken salad, Greek salad, and strawberry caprese salad all have under 20 grams of carbs. If youâre in a sub or sandwich shop, ask if they can turn your order into a salad. Skip the croutons. Ranch dressing usually has a third fewer carbs than balsamic vinaigrette and half as much as Italian dressing. Use only as much dressing as you really need. American Chinese food is known for lots of carb-heavy sauces. But this popular dish of chicken, peanuts,vegetables, and chili peppers has just 14 grams of carbs. Look for entrees without sticky glazes. Take a pass on chow mein and other noodles,riceof any kind, and the fortune cookies. Many fast foods are high in salt, sugar, and fat, so eat home-cooked meals whenever possible. Chicken noodle. Vegetable. Broccoli cheddar. A cup of these soups can have under 20 grams of carbs. And when you slurp them before a meal, you tend to get fuller faster. Tip: Broth-based soups are usually lower in calories and carbs than creamy soups. An easy way to cut your carbs is to order the smallest size. One large fries can have more than twice the carbs as a small serving. Ditto for sodas and milkshakes. Low-carb doesnât always mean healthy, especially at fast-food chains. When it comes to carbs, avoid âemptyâ ones from processed foods and go for healthy carbs from fresh fruits, whole grains, and vegetables. And if you eat low-carb all the time, you may miss out on important nutrients like fiber,magnesium, and some vitamins. You also might feel tired or get muscle cramps or headaches. Thatâs because carbs are your bodyâs top source of energy.

Osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone, a rare but serious condition. Bones can become infected in a number of ways: Infection in one part of the body may spread through the bloodstream into the bone, or an open fracture or surgery may expose the bone to infection. In most cases, a bacteria calledStaphylococcus aureus, a type ofstaph bacteria, causes osteomyelitis. Certain chronic conditions like diabetes may increase your risk for osteomyelitis. Only 2 out of every 10,000 people get osteomyelitis. The condition affects children and adults, although in different ways. Certain conditions and behaviors that weaken the immune system increase a person's risk for osteomyelitis, including: Bone surgery, including hip and knee replacements, also increase the chance of bone infection. In children, osteomyelitis is usually acute. Acute osteomyelitis comes on quickly, is easier to treat, and overall turns out better than chronic osteomyelitis. In children, osteomyelitis usually shows up in arm or leg bones. In adults, osteomyelitis can be either acute or chronic. People with diabetes, HIV, orperipheral vascular diseaseare more prone to chronic osteomyelitis, which persists or recurs, despite treatment. Whether chronic or acute, osteomyelitis often affects an adult's pelvis or vertebrae of the spine. It can also occur in thefeet, especially in a person with diabetes. Acute osteomyelitis develops rapidly over a period of seven to 10 days. The symptoms for acute and chronic osteomyelitis are very similar and include: Osteomyelitis in the vertebrae makes itself known through severeback pain, especially at night. Figuring out if a person has osteomyelitis is the first step in treatment. It's also surprisingly difficult. Doctors rely on X-rays, blood tests,MRI, and bone scans to get a picture of what's going on. A bone biopsyÂ helps determine the type of organism, typically bacteria, causing the infection so the right medication can be prescribed. Treatment focuses on stopping infection in its tracks and preserving as much function as possible. Most people with osteomyelitis are treated with antibiotics, surgery, or both. Antibioticshelp bring the infection under control and often make it possible to avoid surgery. People with osteomyelitis usually get antibiotics for several weeks through an IV, and then switch to a pill. More serious or chronic osteomyelitis requires surgery to remove the infected tissue and bone. Osteomyelitis surgery prevents the infection from spreading further or getting so bad thatamputationis the only remaining option. The best way to prevent osteomyelitis is to keep things clean. If you or your child has a cut, especially a deep cut, wash it completely. Flush out any open wound under running water for five minutes, then bandage it in sterile bandages. If you have chronic osteomyelitis, make sure your doctor knows about your medical history so you can work together to keep the condition under control. If you have diabetes, pay close attention to your feet and contact your doctor at the first sign of infection. The sooner you treat osteomyelitis, the better. In cases of acute osteomyelitis, early treatment prevents the condition from becoming a chronic problem that requires ongoing treatment. Besides the pain and inconvenience of repeated infections, getting osteomyelitis under control early provides the best chance for recovery. SOURCES: Cleveland Clinic: "Osteomyelitis."

People withdiabetesget hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) when their bodies don't have enough sugar to use as fuel. It can happen for several reasons, including diet, some medications and conditions, and exercise. If you get hypoglycemia, write down the date and time when it happened and what you did. Share your record with your doctor, so they can look for a pattern and adjust your medications. Call your doctor if you have more than one unexplained low blood sugar reaction in a week. Most people feel symptoms of hypoglycemia when their blood sugar is 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or lower. Each person with diabetes may have different symptoms of hypoglycemia. You'll learn to spot yours. Early symptoms include: Without treatment, you might get more severe symptoms, including: Ask your doctor if any of your medicines can cause low blood sugar. Insulin treatment can cause low blood sugar, and so can atype of diabetesmedications called "sulfonylureas." Commonly used sulfonylureas include: Older, less common sulfonylureas tend to cause low blood sugar more often than some of the newer ones. Examples of older drugs include: You can also get low blood sugar if you drink alcohol or take allopurinol (Zyloprim), aspirin,Â probenecid (Benemid,Â Probalan), or warfarin (Coumadin) with diabetes medications. You shouldn't get hypoglycemia if you take alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, biguanides (such as metformin), and thiazolidinediones alone, but it can happen when you take them with sulfonylureas or insulin. You can get low blood sugar if you take too much insulin for the amount of carbohydrates you eat or drink. For instance, it can happen: Don't skip meals if you have diabetes, particularly if you're takingdiabetes medications. If you have diabetes and think you have hypoglycemia, check your blood sugar level. Do your levels often drop after meals that include a lot of sugars? Change your diet. Avoid sugary foods, and eat frequent small meals during the day. If you get low blood sugar when you haven't eaten, have a snack before bedtime, such as a protein or a more complex carbohydrate. In cases of severe hypoglycemia, you may require an injection ofbaqsimi,Âdasiglucagon(Zegalogue), or glucagon injection (Gvoke). Your doctor may find that you take too much insulin that peaks toward the evening-to-morning hours. In that case, they may lower your insulin dose or change the time when you get your last dose of it. First, eat or drink 15 grams of a fast-acting carbohydrate, such as: Fifteen minutes after you've eaten a food with sugar in it,check your blood sugaragain. If your blood sugar is still less than 70 mg/dL, eat another serving of one of the foods listed above. Repeat these steps until your sugar becomes normal. Hypoglycemia may make you pass out. If so, you'll need someone to give you a glucagon injection. Glucagonis a prescription medicine that raises blood sugar, and you may need it if you have severe hypoglycemia. It's important that your family members and friends know how to give the injection in case you have a low blood sugar reaction. If you see someone having a severe hypoglycemic reaction, call 911 or take them to the nearest hospital for treatment. Do not try to give an unconscious person food, fluids, or insulin, as they may choke. It's very dangerous. If you're driving and you have hypoglycemia symptoms, pull off the road, check your blood sugar, and eat a sugary food. Wait at least 15 minutes, check your blood sugar, and repeat these steps if necessary. Eat aproteinand carbohydrate source (such as peanut butter crackers or cheese and crackers) before you drive on. Be prepared. Keep a sugar source in your car at all times for emergencies.

Diabetescan harm your nerves. That damage, calledneuropathy, may be painful. It can happen in several ways, and they all seem to be related to blood sugar levels being too high for too long. To prevent it, work with your doctor to manage your blood sugar. You may hear your doctor mention the four types of diabetes-related neuropathy: peripheral, autonomic, proximal, and focal. This type usually affects the feet and legs. Rare cases affect the arms, abdomen, and back. Symptoms include: Early symptoms usually get better when your blood sugar is under control. There aremedicationsto help manage the discomfort. What you should do: This type usually affects the digestive system, especially the stomach. It can also affect the blood vessels, urinary system, and sex organs. In yourdigestive system: Symptoms include: What you should do:You may need to eat smaller meals and take medication to treat it. In blood vessels: Symptoms include: If you have it:Avoid standing up too quickly. You may also need to wear special stockings (ask your doctor about them) and take medicine. In Men: Symptoms include:They may not be able to have or keep an erection, or they may have âdryâ or reduced ejaculations. What you should do:See your doctor, because there are other possible causes than diabetes. Treatment includes: In Women: Symptoms include:Can include less vaginal lubrication and fewer or no orgasms. What you should do:See your doctor. Treatments include: In the Urinary System: Symptoms include: What you should do:Tell your doctor. Treatments may include: This type causes pain (usually on one side) in the thighs, hips, or buttocks. It can also lead to weakness in the legs. Most people with this condition need treatment, such as medication and physical therapy, for their weakness or pain. This type can appear suddenly and affect specific nerves, most often in the head, torso, or leg. It causes muscle weakness or pain. Symptoms include: What you should do:Tell your doctor about your symptoms. Focal neuropathy is painful and unpredictable. But it tends to improve by itself over weeks or months. It usually doesnât cause long-term damage. People with diabetes can also get other nerve-related conditions, such as nerve compressions (entrapment syndromes). Carpal tunnel syndromeis a very common type of entrapment syndrome. It causes numbness and tingling of in the hand and sometimes muscle weakness or pain. If you think you may have any type of nerve problem, talk with your doctor, so they can check for the cause.

A look at what causes high blood sugar and symptoms of the disease. Plus, when you're more likely to have high blood sugar. (Photo Credit: Mrs.rungrudee Khangkhun/Dreamstime) Hyperglycemia (also calledhigh blood sugar or high blood glucose) is when there's too much glucose (sugar) in your bloodstream, typically because your body isn't making or using insulin as well as it should. Insulin is a hormone that helps balance out your blood sugar levels. Around 1 in 10 people in the United States have diabetes.Blood sugar control is at the center of any diabetes treatment plan. Hyperglycemia is a major concern, and can affect people with both type 1 andtype 2 diabetes. There are two main kinds: When it happens often or all the time, high glucose levels can cause damage to your nerves, blood vessels, and organs. It can also lead to other serious conditions.Â It's important to treat high blood sugar right away to help avoid more health problems. Hyperglycemia vs. Hypoglycemia These conditions are related to blood sugar, but they're very different. Hyperglycemia is when your blood sugar spikes too high, while hypoglycemia means your blood sugar level is lower than normal.Â As your body breaks down the food you eat, it turns carbs into a type of sugar called glucose, which gives you energy. Glucose goes into your bloodstream after you eat, but it needs insulin, a hormone from the pancreas, to get into your body's cells so they can use it. When your blood sugar rises, your pancreas releases insulin, letting glucose into cells. Your liver and muscles store extra glucose, which keeps your blood sugar levels normal. Diabetes interrupts this process. In type 2 diabetes, your body resists insulin or doesn't make enough of it, so sugar stays in your blood. When you have diabetes, your blood sugar may rise if you: Insulin resistance A major reason why you may have hyperglycemia is insulin resistance. It's also the leading cause of type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance happens when your muscle, fat, and liver cells react abnormally to insulin. As a result, your body needs higher amounts of insulin to balance out your blood sugar levels. If your body doesn't get the insulin it needs, you'll end up with hyperglycemia.Â Here are some reasons why you could have insulin resistance: The dawn phenomenon Another possible reason for a spike in your blood sugar is what's called the dawn phenomenon. This is when your blood sugar rises in the morning, usually between 4 and 8 a.m. Researchers aren't sure what causes the dawn phenomenon. But they think when your body releases certain hormones (growth hormone, cortisol, and others) overnight, it boosts insulin resistance and raises your blood sugar. Causes of high blood sugar in the morning include: Hyperglycemia in people without diabetes People without diabetes can also have high blood sugar. Causes include: Early hyperglycemia symptoms include: Ongoing high blood sugar may cause: Diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) If hyperglycemia symptoms become too serious, you could form another life-threatening health problem calleddiabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA). When you can't process glucose, your liver makes chemicals called ketones for your body to use for fuel. A lack of insulin coupled with too many ketones causes your blood to turn acidic.Â DKA tends to happen inpeople with diabetes who take insulin or those with type 1 diabetes but haven't been diagnosed. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include: DKA is an emergency and can trigger a coma or death. Go to a hospital right away if you notice any symptoms. You're more likely to have hyperglycemia if you: Talk to your doctor about whether you should take more diabetes medicine than normal when you're ill or dealing with stress. If you have diabetes and notice any of the early signs of high blood sugar, test your blood sugar and call the doctor. TheyÂ may ask you for the results of several readings. TheyÂ could recommend the following changes: Drink more water.Water helps remove extra sugar from your blood through urine, and it helps you avoid dehydration. Exercise more.Working out can help lower your blood sugar. But under certain conditions, it can make blood sugar go even higher. Ask your doctor what kind of exercise is right for you. Caution:If you have type 1 diabetes and your blood sugar is high, you need to check your urine for ketones. When you have ketones, do NOT exercise. If you have type 2 diabetes and your blood sugar is high, you must also be sure that you have no ketones in your urine and that you are well-hydrated. Then your doctor might give you the OK to exercise with caution as long as you feel up to it. Change your eating habits.You may need to meet with a dietitian to change the amount and types of foods you eat. Switch medications.Your doctor may change the amount, timing, or type of diabetes medications you take. Donât make changes without talking to them first. If you have type 1 diabetes and your blood sugar is more than 250 mg/dL, your doctor may want you to test your urine or blood forketones. Call your doctor if your blood sugar is running higher than your treatment goals. If you work to keep your blood sugar under control â follow your meal plan, exercise program, and medicine schedule â you shouldnât have to worry about hyperglycemia. You can also: Living with hyperglycemia can mean other health problems, some that mean you need help right away and others that you may live with for the rest of your life.Â Long-term health problemsUntreated hyperglycemia can trigger other long-term health problems, such as: Emergency health problemsSome conditions caused by blood glucose levels that are too high need treatment right away: Both conditions can cause you to go into a coma, and even lead to death if they aren't treated.Â Â Blood sugar controlis crucial in managing diabetes since high blood sugar can lead to health problems. Track your blood sugar, take insulin or other medicines as prescribed by your doctor, keep a balanced diet, stay hydrated, and exercise routinely to manage high blood sugar. If you notice symptoms of hyperglycemia, talk to your doctor about your diabetes management plan. What are symptoms of hyperglycemia? Symptoms of early hyperglycemia include: Does hyperglycemia turn into diabetes? If you have hyperglycemia, this typically means you have diabetes. You may have hyperglycemia episodes a lot if you live with diabetes.

Most people with diabetes should test their blood sugar (or blood glucose) levels regularly. Knowing the results lets you adjust your strategy for keeping the disease in check. Regular testing can also help you avoid getting long-term health problems that can stem from the condition, like: Research shows that in people with either type 1 ortype 2 diabetes, sticking to your target blood sugar and HbA1c levels makes complications less likely. A blood sugar test measures the level of sugar (glucose) in your blood. Most people with diabetes should test theirblood sugar levelsregularly. Knowing the results lets you adjust your strategy for keeping the disease in check. There are different ways to do the test, including: Glucometers A glucose meter, or glucometer, is a portable machine that can measure your blood sugar level from a small sample of your blood. You access your blood in different ways with different types of glucometers. From your fingertip:Â You prick your finger with a small, sharp needle (called a lancet) and put a drop of blood on a test strip. Then you put the test strip into a meter that shows your blood sugar level. You get results in less than 15 seconds and can store this information for future use. Some meters can tell you your average blood sugar level over aperiodof time and show you charts and graphs of your past test results. You can get blood sugar meters and strips at your local pharmacy. If you test your blood sugar with a fingertip prick, you can find out your glucose levels in 15 seconds. (Photo Credit: Moment/Getty Images) Meters that test other sites:ÂNewer meters let you test sites other than your fingertip, such as your upper arm,forearm, base of the thumb, and thigh. You may get different results than from your fingertip. Blood sugar levels in the fingertips show changes more quickly than those in other testing sites. This is especially true when your blood sugar is rapidly changing, like after a meal or afterexercise. If you are checking your sugar when you have symptoms ofhypoglycemia, you should use your fingertip if possible, because these readings will be more accurate. Continuous glucose monitoring system:These devices, also called interstitial glucose measuring devices, are combined with insulin pumps. They are similar to finger-stick glucose results and can show patterns and trends in your results over time.Â There are different kinds of CGM systems. Some are separate devices, and others are attached to an insulin pump.Â HbA1c home testsÂ Hb stands for hemoglobin, which is the protein inside red blood cells that carries oxygen. When your blood sugar is chronically high, more sugar binds to hemoglobin, so an HbA1c test can give you an estimate of the average amount of glucose in the blood over time. To take an HbA1c test, you prick your finger and put a drop of blood on a test strip for a reading. Some HbA1c tests involve mailing your blood sample to a lab.Â At-home HbA1c tests arenât as accurate as lab tests, but they can be helpful if in-person visits with a doctor arenât easy for you because of distance or other reasons. You can report your results to a doctor from home so they have an idea of how your blood sugar is doing.Â Laboratory tests for diabetes Your doctor may recommend you take a laboratory test for your diabetes. Options include: Fasting blood sugar test.ÂYour doctor will ask you not to drink or eat for 8-12 hours before this test. In a clinic, a technician will either prick your finger or draw blood from a vein in your arm using a needle and test the result in a lab. Yourfastingblood glucose level should be the lowest level you have. A normal result is under 99 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). If your results are higher, itâs a sign that you could have prediabetes or diabetes.Â Oral blood glucose test.Â Doctors also call this a glucose tolerance test. It measures your bodyâs response to sugar. For this test, your doctor will have you drink a syrupy glucose solution that has 75 grams of sugar. A technician will take a blood sample an hour later and 2 hours later to see how your body has processed the sugar. A healthy blood glucose level, 2 hours after you drink the solution, is lower than 140 mg/dL. HbA1c.ÂLike the home HbA1c test, this test estimates your averageblood glucose levelsover a period of time. For the test, a doctor collects a blood sample by drawing blood from a vein in your arm and sends the sample to a lab for testing.Â Most people withtype 1 diabetesshould monitor their blood sugar 4-6 times a day. You may need to check it several times throughout the day, such as before meals or exercise, at bedtime, before driving, and whenever you suspect your blood sugar levels are low. Everyone is different, so ask your doctor when and how often you should check your blood sugar. If you're sick, you'll probably need to test your blood sugar more often. 1 Having certain conditions, likeanemiaorgout, can affect your blood sugar levels.Â Other conditions can make a difference in your results, too, such as: If you keep seeing unusual results, recalibrate your meter and check the test strips. The chart below gives you an idea of where your blood sugar level should be throughout the day. Your ideal blood sugar range may be different from another person's and will change throughout the day. Home blood glucose monitoring and HbA1c Monitoring your HbA1c level is also important for diabetes control. Many home glucose monitors also display an average blood glucose reading, which can correlate with your HbA1c. Average Blood Glucose Level (mg/dL) HbA1c (%) 126 (100-152) 6 154 (123-185) 7 183 (147-217) 8 212 (170-249) 9 240 (193-282) 10 269 (217-314) 11 298 (240-347) 12 Â Ask your doctor about your target blood sugar range, and make a plan for how to handle blood sugar readings that are either too high or too low and when to call your doctor. Learn about the symptoms of high orlow blood sugar, and know what you can do if you begin to have symptoms. Keep good records of any blood, urine, or ketone tests you do. Most glucose monitors also have a memory. Your records can alert you to any problems or trends. These test records help your doctor make any needed changes in your meal plan, medicine, or exercise program. Bring these records with you every time you see your doctor. Some devices send your readings to a computer or mobile device, making it easy to share the data directly with your diabetes care team. As youâre recording your blood sugar, make a note of yourdietand movement (even activities like gardening can make a difference) around the time of your reading. This will give you a fuller picture of whatâs affecting your levels and better inform how to keep them steady in the future.Â To ensure youâre getting the most accurate read on your blood sugar, be sure youâre doing your testing correctly. Follow these tips: Testing your blood sugar is one of the most important tools for managing diabetes. You can monitor blood sugar at home with glucose meters and test strips, continuous glucose monitoring systems, and HbA1c tests. Your doctor will help you know what your target range should be and what may affect your readings. The A1C target goal should be individualized , yet a a goal of <7.0% is recommended by experts as a practical level for most patients to reduce the risk of long-term complications of diabetes. Should I check my blood sugar if I have diabetes? Monitoring your blood sugar levels is one of the most important parts of diabetes management. Knowing your blood sugar levels informs your daily treatment and helps you keep your levels as steady as possible as you make choices about what to eat and do during the day.Â What should your blood sugar level be if you have diabetes? Target blood sugar levels vary by person. Your doctor will be able to tell you the healthiest range for your age, size, lifestyle, and other medical conditions. Your target range may also change as you age. In general, most (non-pregnant) adults should have a range of 80-130 mg/dL before meals and less than 180 mg/dL 1 to 2 hours after the beginning of a meal. What blood sugar level confirms diabetes? To diagnose diabetes, your doctor will look at your HbA1c levels, which give a measurement of your blood sugar levels over time. An HbA1c level of 6.5% or higher on two separate tests means you have diabetes. An HbA1c between 5.7% and 6.4% means that you have prediabetes. Below 5.7% is considered normal. How often should I check my blood sugar for type 2 diabetes? Your doctor will tell you when itâs most important to check your blood sugar. Itâs important to test when you have symptoms of high or low blood sugar. In general, itâs good to check when you first wake up, before and after meals, before and after exercise, and before you go to sleep.Â What is the normal range for a blood sugar test? A normal range for a fasting blood sugar test is 70 to 99 mg/dL. A non-fasting blood test will give variable results, depending on when you last ate, but should be below 125 mg/dL. Are non-invasive blood sugar tests accurate? Researchers are still honing methods for testing blood sugar that donât involve getting a blood sample. These include passing a type of radiation into a part of the body with lots of veins, or analyzing sweat, saliva, tears, or urine. Developers are still working on accurate ways to do this. Data from blood is still the most reliable method today. SOURCES: The Diabetes Toolbox. FDA.

Ketosis is a process that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates to burn for energy. Instead, it burns fat and makes things called ketones, which it can use for fuel. Ketosis is a word you'll probably see when you're looking for information on diabetes or weight loss. Is it a good thing or a bad thing? That depends. "Keto" diets are popular weight loss programs that promote ketosis.In addition to helping you burn fat, ketosis can make you feel less hungry. It also helps you keep muscle. A common sign that you've achieved ketosis is a particular smell to your breath. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images.) For healthy people who don't have diabetes and aren't pregnant, ketosis usually kicks in after 3 or 4 days of eating fewer than 50 grams of carbohydrates per day. That's about three slices of bread, a cup of low-fat fruit yogurt, or two small bananas. You can start ketosis by fasting, too. A diet high in fat and protein but very low in carbs is called a ketogenic or "keto" diet. A keto meal plan doesn't completely cut out carbs, but you should limit yourself to 50 grams per day. You may think of carbs as things such as bread and pasta, but fruits are high in carbs, too. Eggs, lean meats, and leafy greens are some basic components of keto meals. (Photo Credit: Moment/Getty Images.) Vegetables Every day, you should eat five servings of non-starchy vegetables. (A serving is about 1/2 cup of cooked veggies or one cup of raw veggies.) Non-starchy vegetables you can find easily include: Protein Aim for at least 60 grams of protein every day. Good sources include: You might not be as hungry as usual when you're aiming for ketosis. Try eating the protein part of your meal first to make sure you meet your protein goals. Healthy fats These are a good source of calorie-dense nutrition. They also can lower your "bad"cholesterol. Examples include: Fruits You'll want to limit fruit because it's high in carbohydrates. Aim for one cup per day. Berries are a good choice because they have fewer carbs than other fruits. Liquids Avoid drinks that are sweetened with sugar. But try to get 64 ounces of fluid each day to stay hydrated. This will help keep your electrolytes in the right range. Calcium You need this nutrient to keep your bones strong. Aim for 1,200 milligrams a day. You can takecalcium supplements, but good food sources include: Ketosis can have some benefits beyond weight loss. Doctors may put children who have epilepsy on a keto diet because it can help prevent seizures. Adults who have epilepsy sometimes eat modified Atkins diets. Some research suggests that ketogenic diets might help lower your risk of heart disease. Other studies show that specific diets very low in carbs help people who have diseases such as: Researchers are also studying the effects of these diets on conditions including: During the first week of a keto diet, you might start to feel bad. Some people call this the "keto flu," but it isnât an official medical condition. Some doctors think this is due to sugar and carbohydrate withdrawal. Or it could be because of changes to your gut bacteria or an immune system reaction. You might notice temporary side effects such as: Drinking plenty of water can ease or prevent some of these symptoms. About 1 in 20 children who have epilepsy and are on the keto diet get kidney stones. A supplement called potassium citrate can help prevent them. Talk to your doctor about the kidney stone risk if your child is on the keto diet. If youâre a new mom and donât get enough calories or fluids, ketosis could affect your breast milk supply. Doctors generally recommend that you wait until youâre donebreastfeedingif you want to start the keto diet. Not everyone loses weight in ketosis. There are several possible reasons for this. One is that some foods considered keto-friendly -- avocados, for instance -- are high in calories. Eating too much of these foods will make it hard to lose weight. Some research suggests that your genetic makeup can affect how well your body responds to a keto diet. If you're not losing weight, you might have an underlying medical issue, or the medicine you take could be interfering with weight loss. Some key factors may include: Certain things hold true about all weight-loss programs: You have to stick to it, and you need to burn calories. So if you eat foods that aren't recommended or don't exercise, that can affect your outcome. Other factors that can make it hard to lose weight include: Some over-the-counter supplements claim to raise your ketone levels. They come as pills, powders, oils, and other forms. There isnât much research on whether they work or if theyâre safe. Talk to your doctor before you start taking any supplements. If you're healthy and eating a balanced diet, your body controls how much fat it burns so you don't usually make or use ketones. But when you cut way back on your calories or carbs, your body will switch to ketosis for energy. It can also happen after you exercise for a long time and during pregnancy. If you have diabetes that isnât under control, ketosis can become dangerous when ketones build up. High levels lead to dehydration and change the chemical balance of your blood. It becomes acidic and can cause a coma or death. People who have diabetes can getketoacidosis, or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), when they don't take enough insulin. They can also get DKA when they're sick or injured or when they don't get enough fluids and become dehydrated. Some people who donât have diabetes can get ketoacidosis, too. It's caused by alcoholism, starvation, or an overactive thyroid. A healthy low-carb diet shouldn't cause a problem. If you have these symptoms, call your doctor: When you have diabetes, throwing up can be especially dangerous. Although DKA usually starts off slowly, throwing up can speed up the process so that it happens in just a few hours. Call your doctor if you've been throwing up for 2 hours or more. Ketosis isn't harmful in an otherwise healthy person and requires no treatment. If you progress to ketoacidosis, however, you'll need quick medical attention. You can find out how much ketosis is going on in your body by testing forketonesin your blood or urine. You can buy test strips to check your pee at home. Some blood sugar meters can measure ketones in your blood. If you don't know how and when to test your ketones, talk to your doctor or diabetes instructor. High levels of ketones are dangerous. Ketosis levels Here are some guidelines on ketones readings:Â If you're diabetic, a reading between1.6 and 3 (mmol/L) indicates some risk for ketoacidosis, and you should check with your doctor. When you're in ketosis, your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates, so it turns to burning fat for fuel. The fat is turned into a substance called ketones. You can achieve ketosis by following a low-carb, high-protein diet, sometimes called a keto diet. Some research shows that keto diets can help people lose weight. They also might have benefits for people withtype 2 diabetes,insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome. When you're in ketosis, you may have headaches, fatigue, stomach upset, and irritability, among other side effects. Some people develop an odd smell to their breath. If your level of ketones gets too high, you're in danger of ketoacidosis, a condition that requires immediate medical attention. How do I know if I'm in ketosis? You can measure the level of ketones in your body. If the level isbetween 0.5 and 3.0 (mmol/L), you're in nutritional ketosis.Â Is ketosis good for the body? Several studies have found that keto diets can help people lose weight. It's sometimes recommended for kids withepilepsy. What happens when you're in ketosis? Because your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates, it turns to fat for fuel.

Adult-onset diabetes is often misdiagnosed in adults, delaying much-needed care. (Photo Credit: Moment/Getty Images) Type 1 diabetes used to be called juvenile diabetes, as it was usually diagnosed in children and teens. But more than half of all new cases oftype 1 diabetesare now diagnosed in adults.Â Adult-onset type 1 diabetes happens when your pancreas stops producing insulin, usually because of an autoimmune condition that attacks the organ's cells. Because it is often related to an autoimmune condition, it is sometimes also called latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). Symptoms of adult-onset type 1 diabetes usually begin after age 30. Many of the symptoms are similar to those oftype 2 diabetes, so many adults are misdiagnosed at first. But it's important to learn the differences and figure out what's going on so you can get the treatment that's right for you. Type 1 diabetesand LADA are both typically caused by an autoimmune condition that attacks the pancreas, causing the organ to make less insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps your body regulate the amount of sugar in your blood. If you aren't making enough insulin, glucose (sugar) from the food you eat stays in your bloodstream instead of moving to your muscles, fat, and liver, where it can be used for energy. Traditionally, type 1 diabetes was thought to be found mostly in children. It's frequently diagnosed during the ages of 4-6 or 10-14. When children are diagnosed, they typically have to begin tracking their blood sugar to make sure it stays at healthy levels. Children with type 1 diabetes also usually take insulin several times a day. If you are diagnosed with adult-onset type 1 diabetes, you may not need to begin taking insulin right away. Your pancreas may still make some insulin, as damage to it tends to happen more slowly. Because of this, adults are often misdiagnosed at first as having type 2 diabetes. Some health care professionals think this condition should be diagnosed as something different than traditional type 1 diabetes because it progresses so slowly. You may hear it called adult-onset type 1 diabetes, LADA, or even type 1.5 diabetes. No one knows exactly why your body begins to attack the pancreas when you have adult-onset type 1 diabetes. It could be a virus or toxins in the environment that cause your immune system to attack your cells. And if you have a parent with type 1 diabetes, it's more likely that you will then get type 1 diabetes. If one of your parents has type 1 diabetes, your risk of getting it is 1%-8%. If two parents have it, the risk climbs to 30%. But unlike type 1 diabetes in children, lifestyle factors also may play a role in getting adult-onset diabetes. As with type 2 diabetes, if you are overweight, not physically active, drinkalcohol, or smoke, you may be more likely to be diagnosed withLADA. Â You may have late-onset type 1 diabetes and have no symptoms. But more likely, you will have symptoms that aresimilar to those of type 2 diabetes. Over several months, you may notice that you: Adult-onset type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in people over the age of 30. People of all races and ethnic groups can get late-onset type 1 diabetes, but it's most common among those of Northern European descent. Having a low birth weight is also a risk factor. Because genetics also plays a role in LADA, you may be at higher risk if one of your parents or a brother or sister has it. Because it is an autoimmune condition, you are also at greater risk if you, or a family member, has another autoimmune condition. Other risk factors that are related to your lifestyle that can place you at a higher risk include: Â Â It's not always easy to tell if you have type 1 diabetes when you're an adult. There are several reasons for this. Symptoms take longer to show up in adults than they do in children. This can make it harder for doctors to know what's going on, especially if they don't specialize in the condition. Also, many people with type 1 diabetes are lean or have a normal weight. Your doctor might rule out diabetes since most people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. Your doctor may suggest several tests that can tell you if you have diabetes, although these won't show if it's type 1 or type 2. Glycated hemoglobin (A1c) test.It measures your average blood glucose level for 2-3 months. If you have an A1c level of 6.5 or higher on two separate exams, you have diabetes. Random blood sugar test.It checks your blood glucose at a random time of day. A level of 200 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) or higher is a sign that you have diabetes. Fasting blood sugar test.Your doctor does this first thing in the morning before you've eaten. You have diabetes if your level is 126 mg/dL or higher on two separate tests. There are few reliable tests that let your doctor know that you have LADA. But if you are lean, are age 40 or younger, and your symptoms get worse even if you are on diabetes medication, it may be adult-onset type 1 diabetes. If this is the case, your doctor may also test your blood for certain autoimmune antibodies, which you have with type 1 diabetes, but not in type 2. They might also check your pee for ketones, or fat by-products. If these are in your sample, you probably have LADA. Your doctor can also test yourC-peptidelevels. C-peptide is a substance your body produces when it makes insulin. If your levels are low, your body isn't producing enough insulin. This measure is important to diagnose LADA because, with type 2 diabetes, levels are high. If you have LADA, your levels will drop more slowly than with traditional type 1 diabetes.Â If you have latent autoimmune diabetes, you will probably need insulin but may not need it for months or years after your diagnosis. You may initially be able to manage the condition with exercise, a healthy diet, and/or medications. The goal of treatment, at the beginning, is to keep your blood glucose at healthy levels and to delay the disease from progressing. There are also some lifestyle treatments that your doctor will recommend to keep your blood sugar levels healthy and avoid complications down the road. These include: A couple of medications your doctor may prescribe aremetformin, which helps lower blood sugar levels, and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP), which can help preserve the function of your cells. You will need to talk with your doctor to understand the best kind of medicine, depending on how far your LADA has progressed and your blood glucose levels. Â Â When you are diagnosed with adult-onset type 1 diabetes, the way you manage it will depend upon the progression of the condition. Your doctor will help you decide the best way to care for yourself after diagnosis. Because your insulin is directly impacted by what you eat, one of the most important things you can do is have a healthy diet. If you have LADA, this includes: Exercising can help keep your blood glucose levels normal, improvecholesterol, and lower your weight. It's an important component of living with LADA. Experts recommend 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week. But with adult-onset diabetes, you should talk with your doctor to make sure you can manage your glucose levels during physical activity. You may start with a short walk every day, just to get your body moving. Here are other tips for living well with adult-onset diabetes:Â Adult-onset diabetes can be similar to both traditional type 1 diabetes and type 2. But LADA, unlike type 2, is anautoimmune disease. People are usually diagnosed after the age of 30, have symptoms that progress slower than type 1, and often become dependent on insulin at some point. There is a genetic component to adult-onset diabetes, so you are at higher risk if you have an immediate family member with the condition. What are the complications of type 1 diabetes? If you manage your blood sugar well, you are less likely to have complications. If your blood sugar isn't managed very well, you can end up having: Do symptoms of type 1 diabetes differ in adults & children? Symptoms of type 1 diabetes are the same in children and adults. They may show up slightly differently in children â they may wet the bed, where an adult wakes up and gets to the bathroom. Also, if you have LADA, your symptoms may progress more slowly than those of a child diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. What types of insulin are used for adults with type 1 diabetes?Â Insulin may be injectable or given through a pump worn on your body.

Type 2 diabetesis a disease in which your body doesnât make enough of a hormone called insulin or doesnât use insulin the way it should. Insulin helps carry glucose (also called sugar) to your cells. So, when thereâs a problem with insulin, glucose builds up in your blood. Youâve probably heard this called high blood sugar. About 90% of people with diabetes have type 2. The other main types are type 1, in which your body stops making insulin, and gestational, which happens in pregnant people. You can usually control type 2 diabetes with lifestyle changes. Some people also need medication. You might not know that you have type 2 diabetes until it affects your health. About 1 in 4 people with the condition donât know that they have it. Symptoms can come on slowly. TheyÂ may include: More thirst.Â When sugar builds up in yourÂ blood, yourÂ kidneysÂ work harder to remove it. This pulls fluids from your tissues, making you dehydrated, so you feel thirsty. Always thirsty? Feeling parched may be an early symptom of type 2 diabetes. (Photo Credit: DigitalVision/Getty Images) MoreÂ hunger.Â Because diabetesÂ can stop glucose from getting to your cells, you feel hungry even after youâve eaten. Peeing often.Â Youâll pee more because your kidneys are working hard to remove extra sugar from your system. Dry mouth.Â DehydrationÂ and peeing a lot can drain moisture from yourÂ mouthÂ as well. Weight loss without trying.Â When you lose sugar from peeing a lot, you lose calories, too. You might lose weight even though youâre eating as usual. Fatigue.Â When your body canât use energy from food, you could feel weak and tired. Dehydration can make you feel this way, too. Blurry vision.ÂHigh blood sugarcan make you have trouble focusing. Headaches.Â HighÂ blood sugar levelsÂ can cause your head to hurt. Loss of consciousness.After you exercise, skip a meal, or take too much medication, your blood sugar could get too low, and you could pass out. Infections or sores that donât heal.Â High blood sugar can slow blood flow and make it harder for your body to heal. Tingling hands andÂ feet.Â Type 2 diabetesÂ can affect nerves in your hands and feet. Red, swollen, and tender gums.Â You might be more likely to get infections in your gums and the bones that hold yourÂ teethÂ in place. Your gums may get infected or pull away from yourÂ teeth. Your teeth might become loose. Itâs important to get your blood sugar under control to avoid these serious conditions: Hypoglycemia.Â If your blood sugar falls below 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), it can lead to accidents,Â coma, and death. Hyperglycemia.Â Blood sugar that goes above 180-200 mg/dL can give youÂ heart, nerve, kidney, and vision problems. Over the long term, it can also cause coma and death. Over time, people with type 2 diabetes may have other health problems: Diabetic ketoacidosis.Â When you donât have enoughÂ insulinÂ in your system, your blood sugar rises, and your body breaks down fat for energy. Toxic acids calledketonesbuild up and spill into yourÂ urine. It can cause coma and death if you donât treat it. Heart and blood vessel diseases.Â People with diabetes are more likely to have conditions suchÂ as high blood pressureÂ andÂ high cholesterol, which play a role inÂ heart disease. Also, high blood sugar can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart. High blood pressure.ÂDiabetes doubles your risk of high blood pressure, which makes you more likely to have heart disease orÂ stroke. Nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy).Â This can cause tingling and numbness, most often in your feet and legs. But it can also affect yourÂ digestive system, urinary tract, blood vessels, and heart. Eye damage.Â Diabetes can cause: Kidney disease.ÂYour kidneys may have to work harder to filter out the extra sugar, along with all the other waste products in your blood. Hearing problems.Â Doctors arenât sure why this happens, but they think high blood sugar levels damage the small blood vessels in yourÂ ears. Skin problems.ÂDiabetes can cause: Infections.Â Youâre more likely to get bacterial and fungal infections. Itching.ÂCauses include infections, dry skin, and poor circulation. You might notice it on your lower legs. Acanthosis nigricans.Â These velvety darker areas can appear on your neck, armpits, groin, hands, elbows, and knees. Diabetic dermopathy.Â This involves changes to small blood vessels that result in red or brown scaly patches. They often show up on your feet and the fronts of your legs. Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum.This rare condition also affects your blood vessels. It starts as a dull, red, raised area but winds up as a shiny scar with a violet border. Your skin could itch or crack open. Women are more likely to get this than men. Allergic reactions.ÂYou could get these in response to insulin or another diabetes medication. DiabeticÂ blisters (bullosis diabeticorum).ÂThese sores look like burnÂ blistersÂ and can show up on the backs of your fingers, hands, toes, feet, and sometimes legs or forearms. DisseminatedÂ granuloma annulare.ÂYou might get red, brown, or skin-colored rings or arc-shaped raised areas on your fingers,Â ears, or trunk. Type 2 was once called adult-onset diabetes because it was rare in children and teens. But it has become more common since the mid-1990s, in large part because more young people are overweight or obese, a risk factor for the disease. Also, children face a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if they donât get enough exercise or have a close relative with the condition. African American, Hispanic, Native American, Alaska Native, Asian American, and Pacific Islander children are more likely to get it. Your risk of type 2 diabetes goes up as you age because your body can become resistant toinsulinand your pancreas might not work as well as it used to. People aged 65 and older are more likely to face diabetes complications, especially heart attacks, eye problems, loss of a leg (amputation), and kidney disease. Let them know if you have any of the common symptoms of type 2 diabetes or if you have questions about type 2 diabetes. It's important to get tested and start treatment early to prevent serious complications. There are many early signs of type 2 diabetes, including being more thirsty than normal, peeing more often, fatigue, and headaches. If you're experiencing new symptoms, talk with your health care provider, even if they seem minor. Many people with the condition don't know they have it. Most people can control their type 2 diabetes symptoms with the right lifestyle changes and medications. How does type 2 diabetes affect your life? If you're diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, you'll need to make certain lifestyle changes to control your symptoms. Your doctor can help you figure out the best diet and exercise routines for you. You may need to begin monitoring your glucose (blood sugar) with an at-home glucose meter each day, especially if you're taking insulin. If you have side effects from any new drugs you take to control your diabetes, talk with your health care provider about your concerns regarding medications. What three drinks should diabetics avoid? Soda, sweet tea, and sports drinks contain lots of added sugar that can spike your glucose levels. Instead, consider opting for water to keep your blood sugar in check.

Diabetic ketoacidosis, also known as DKA, is a serious complication of diabetes that happens when your body doesn't have enough of a hormone called insulin, which usually creates energy by letting blood sugar into your cells. Instead, your body starts to break down fat for energy, causing ketones to develop in your blood. If your body makes too many ketones at once, the buildup damages your body and makes your blood too acidic, which is called ketoacidosis. If you donât get medical help in time, DKA can be life-threatening. Symptoms of DKA often build up slowly, so itâs important to know the warning signs, as it can usually be prevented and treated if discovered early. Ketoacidosis blood sugar levels When you donât have enough insulin, the sugars you eat canât get out of your blood and into your cells. This makes the sugar build up in your blood, causing high blood sugar.Â During diabetic ketoacidosis, your blood sugar will be very high and your insulin levels will be low. If your blood sugar is over 240 mg/dL, you should check your ketones using a urine ketone test or a glucometer (blood ketone test) every 4-6 hours. Ketoacidosis is generally considered to start at 250 mg/dL. Talk to your doctor if your blood sugar level is outside of your target range. Go to the emergency room if your blood sugar is 300 mg/dL or more and wonât go down or if you have any symptoms of DKA, including frequent throwing up, tiredness, or difficulty breathing. ÂKetoacidosis vs. ketosis Ketoacidosis andketosissound similar but are different processes.Â Typically, your body uses sugar (glucose) for energy. With ketosis, you donât eat many carbohydrates (foods like bread, pasta, or other starches), which usually turn into sugar quickly, so your body starts burning fat to create energy. Ketones are released into your blood as fat is broken down. Your body makes ketones, but not enough to make your blood too acidic, so ketosis isnât dangerous. With ketosis, your body has enough insulin and it's working properly. Â In diabetic ketoacidosis, ketones build up too fast, and your blood becomes acidic. Diabetic ketoacidosis is life-threatening. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes that happens when your body doesn't have enough of a hormone called insulin, which usually creates energy by letting blood sugar into your cells. Talk to your doctor if your blood sugar level is outside of your target range. (Photo credit: E+/Getty Images) Diabetic ketoacidosis symptoms can appear quickly and may even be your first warning sign that you have diabetes.The first signs of DKA can include: If you donât get medical help, you can have more DKA symptoms, including: Diabetic ketoacidosis can be very dangerous and even life-threatening. You should go to the emergency room right away if: If you have the symptoms described above, you should go to the emergency room or call 911, even if you havenât been told you have diabetes. HHS vs. DKA Another condition that can sometimes seem like diabetic ketoacidosis isÂ hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, also called HHS. HHS and DKA have similar symptoms, including feeling very thirsty, having to pee more than usual, dry mouth, and feeling confused or less alert, weak, or nauseous. Both HHS and DKA can happen when your blood sugar is too high.Â With HHS, very high blood sugar over a long period makes you dehydrate (lose water), causing your blood to get too concentrated. This can harm yourbrain, kidneys,heart, and other parts of your body. HHS is more likely to happen to people withtype 2 diabetes. Symptoms of HHS that usually donât happen with DKA include blurry vision or suddenly losing your ability to see, trouble moving your body, especially on only one side, and seeing things that arenât usually there (hallucinations). A big difference is that with HHS, your body doesnât make too many ketones. HHS also takes longer than DKA to develop, and your blood sugar is usually higher (600 or above) than it is in DKA. People who develop HHS are more likely to die from it (about 10 or 20 of every 100 people). On the other hand, only about 1 to 8 in 100 people who get DKA die from it. Â Diabetic ketoacidosis usually happens because your body doesn't have enough insulin. Your cells can't use the sugar in your blood for energy, so they use fat for fuel instead. Burning fat makes acids called ketones. If the process goes on for a while, they could build up in your blood. Having too many ketones can change the chemical balance of your blood and throw off your entire system. Certain things can make your blood sugar go up and your insulin go down, which makes your body more likely to start burning fat and building up ketones. These include: Missing insulin doses and diabetes mismanagement.ÂIf you miss doses of insulin or other medications a lot, or if your doctor prescribed the wrong dose, etc., your blood sugar might be further away from your target. You are at higher risk for DKA when your diabetes is not well-managed. Timing of diabetes diagnosis.Â People who donât know they are diabetic and people who just found out that they have diabetes are more likely to get DKA. This is probably because they donât have as much experience managing theirdiabetes. How you take your insulin.ÂPeople who give themselvesshots of insulinare more likely to get DKA than people who use an insulin pump. However, if you use an insulin pump and it gets clogged or stops working, youâre at risk for DKA because your body wonât get the amount of insulin you need until your pump gets fixed. Using expired insulin.If your insulin is spoiled or expired, it might not work as well as it should. Other things that could lead to DKA include: Anyone who has diabetes can get diabetic ketoacidosis. Some people find out that they have diabetes only after they get DKA. However, certain things make you more likely than other people with diabetes to get DKA. These risk factors include: Â Your doctor will figure out if you have DKA by doing aphysical examand asking you about your symptoms, experiences, and medical history. Theyâll check your blood sugar, ketones in your pee and/or blood, and your blood pH and bicarbonate levels. Your doctor might also do tests to diagnose DKA or check how itâs affecting you. These include: Other diagnostic testing for DKA includes: Your doctor might give you a chest X-ray, CAT scan, orMRIto rule out other problems or get more information about how DKA is impacting you. They may also recommend tests for your heart (electrocardiogram, or ECG) to check how it's working. Testing for ketones You can check yourself for ketones at home with a urine sample. You can buy kits for testing your pee over the counter.Â Someglucose meterscan also test for ketones in the blood sample when you do a finger prick. Ask your doctor to show you how to do an at-home ketone test if you have any questions. If you have diabetes, itâs important to follow advice from your doctor about when to test for ketones. In general, you should test for ketones in these situations: If you have any symptoms of DKA, you should call your doctor or go to the emergency room right away. This is especially important if you have certain risk factors. If diabetic ketoacidosis is untreated, you could pass out, go into a coma, and possibly die. You should go to the hospital to treat diabetic ketoacidosis. There, you will receive emergency treatments, such as: DKA complications are possible if you donât have emergency treatments such as electrolyte replacement and insulin. They include: Your doctor may change your insulin dose, or the kind you use, to prevent DKA from happening again. Good blood sugar control will help you avoid ketoacidosis in the future. Make sure you manage your diabetes through your diet, exercise, medications, and self-care. Follow these steps to help prevent DKA: Â Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of diabetes that can be life-threatening. With DKA, your body doesnât have enough insulin to process sugar, so it starts burning fats instead. This creates ketones that can build up and begin to poison your system if you donât get medical help in time. You can prevent DKA by keeping your blood sugar in your target range. Make sure to go to the doctor or emergency room right away if you have any DKA symptoms such as being very thirsty, having to pee a lot, fruity-smelling breath, or feeling confused or weak. Â Diabetic ketoacidosis can be treated and you can get better from it, especially if you get medical help right away.

Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells. It carries oxygen around your body, delivering it to tissues. Hemoglobin also carries carbon dioxide to the lungs so you can breathe it out. Iron is a part of hemoglobin. It carries oxygen. If your iron is low, your body canât make hemoglobin or carry enough oxygen to your tissues. Hemoglobin is also the part of blood that gives it a red color.Â Hemoglobin structure Hemoglobin is made up of four protein chains called globins. Two of the globins are called alpha chains and two are called beta chains. Each globin has a compound with an iron molecule in the middle called a heme group. The iron molecule is what binds to oxygen to carry it through your body. What does hemoglobin do? Each heme group can hold one oxygen molecule, which means one hemoglobin molecule can hold four oxygen molecules. The alpha and beta chains of hemoglobin are arranged in a special way that helps each oxygen bind efficiently. Once one oxygen molecule binds to a heme group, the structureâs shape changes slightly so that the next oxygen molecule can attach more easily, and so on. The level of hemoglobin your body needs to function well depends on several factors including your age, race, sex, and general health. It can even vary based on where you live. For example, people who live at higher altitudes tend to have a higher range of hemoglobin levels than people who live at lower altitudes. Normal hemoglobin levels Hemoglobin is measured in grams per deciliter (gm/dL). Normal levels are different for men and women. The typical ranges are: Men: 14.0 to 17.5 gm/dL Women: 12.3 to 15.3 gm/dL Low hemoglobin Hemoglobin levels that fall below the normal range can be a sign of certain health conditions such as cancer oranemia. When your hemoglobin is low, your body canât get enough oxygen to its tissues, and it makes you feel tired and weak. Low hemoglobin levels may happen because: High hemoglobin If your hemoglobin levels are above normal, itâs usually because your body has had low oxygen levels over time (hypoxia). You might gethypoxiabecause of: High hemoglobin may make you have: To find out your hemoglobin levels, your doctor can give you a hemoglobin test. They do this by putting a needle into a vein and taking a sample of your blood. Sometimes, they can do the test with blood from a finger stick, or a heel stick in infants. They send the blood sample to a lab for testing. Often a hemoglobin test is part of a doctorâs routine physical exam. Acomplete blood count(CBC) is a series of tests on a blood sample that tells your doctor the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your body. Hemoglobin test at home You can buy kits that give you hemoglobin level results at home. You take the test by pricking your finger with a small injector. You collect the blood in a test tube which has a solution in it. Then, you shake the blood sample and solution together. You read the results by comparing the color of the sample to a color card after 2 minutes, which gives you a hemoglobin level estimate. If you have a low hemoglobin level, your doctor will want to find the underlying cause and treat it, if need be. One common way to raise hemoglobin is to increase the iron in your diet. Specifically, heme iron is a rich source of easily absorbed iron. Sources of heme iron include: Your body can absorb nonheme sources of iron more easily if you eat sources ofvitamin C(such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, kiwi, or broccoli) at the same time. Nonheme sources of iron include: Anything you cook in iron cookware will also absorb some iron and raise your levels slightly. The hemoglobin A1c test tells you your average level of blood sugar over the past 2-3 months. It's also called HbA1c, the glycated hemoglobin test, or glycohemoglobin. Itâs a lot like a baseball player's season batting average. A single game doesn't tell you how a player is performing in their career. Similarly, one day's test results don't give you the complete picture of how your treatment is working. Your A1c test results help your doctor determine whether you have diabetes. Itâs also used to diagnose prediabetes, in which your blood sugar level is higher than it should be but not high enough to qualify as diabetes. If your A1c levels are high enough to indicate either diabetes or prediabetes, but you donât have symptoms of either, your doctor may order another A1c test on a different day to confirm the diagnosis. People who have diabetes need this test regularly to see if their levels are staying within range. It can tell if you need to adjust your diabetes medicines. What is blood sugar (glucose)? Blood sugar, or blood glucose, provides energy to the cells in your body, allowing them to do their jobs. You get most of your blood sugar from the sugar, fiber, starches, and other carbohydrates in your diet. Your pancreas produces a hormone called insulin, which helps your cells absorb blood sugar to use for energy or to store for later. That process helps keep your blood sugar at a healthy level. But when you have diabetes, this process is disrupted, and without treatment, your blood sugar level remains high. An HbA1c test shows your blood sugar levels over the last few months. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) The sugar in your blood is called glucose. When glucose builds up in your blood, it binds to the hemoglobin in your red blood cells. The A1c test measuresÂ how much glucose is bound. Red blood cells live for about 3 months, so the test shows the average level of glucose in your blood for the past 3 months. If your glucose levels have been high over recent weeks, your hemoglobin A1c test result will be higher. The A1c test can be done in two ways. Letâs look at both. Blood draw from a vein: Blood draw from a finger prick: The A1c chart below shows how A1c levels compare with blood sugar levels. There are several reasons why you might need an A1c test, such as if you have symptoms ofdiabetes. These symptoms include: If you donât have these symptoms, you may get an A1c test to screen for diabetes as part of a routine doctorâs appointment, such as a physical. Several different factors help determine when you should first get your A1c tested and how often the test should be repeated. Keep in mind that different health organizations have different recommendations for when diabetes screening should begin. Letâs look at the CDC guidelines first. According to the CDC, you should get your A1c tested if: How often should you get an A1c test? Get tested every 3 years if your initial test results were normal but you are: If your initial results indicate prediabetes, get tested every 1-2 years or as often as your doctor recommends. Talk to your doctor about lifestyle changes you can make so that you donât go on to develop diabetes. If you test positive for prediabetes or diabetes but donât have symptoms, your doctor will test you again on a different day to confirm the results. Once your doctor confirms your diagnosis, youâll get an A1c test twice a year or more. Your testing schedule depends on different factors, such as changes made to your medications, other underlying health conditions, and how well-managed your diabetes is. For example, if you struggle to keep your blood sugar in the healthy range, you may need an A1c test four times a year. Some health organizations advise that you should start screening for diabetes earlier than age 45. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends the following: If your test results are normal, the ADA advises that the test should be repeated every 3 years. Your doctor may recommend screening more often if you have symptoms of diabetes or your risk of diabetes goes up (for example, if you gain weight). Diabetes screening may be done with an A1c test or another blood test that measures your blood sugar. Because the A1c does not require fasting, itâs considered more convenient than the others. Your doctor will decide which test is best for you. This oneâs easy. You donât need to do anything to prepare for your A1c test. Do I need to fast for an A1C test? No, the test doesn't require fasting beforehand, so youâre free to eat and drink normally. But if you have other blood tests scheduled at the same time, they may require special prep. Check with your doctor. For people without diabetes, the normal range for the HbA1c level is between 4% and 5.6%. If your levels are in the range of 5.7%-6.4%, it means you have prediabetes and a higher chance of getting diabetes. Levels of 6.5% or higher mean you have diabetes. Whatâs a dangerous level of A1C? If your A1c climbs above 9%, your risk of serious diabetes complications goes up. These complications include: The target A1c level for people with diabetes is usually less than 7%. The higher the hemoglobin A1c, the higher your riskÂ of having complications related to diabetes.Â Someone who has had untreated diabetes for a long time might have a level above 8%. If you have diabetes and your level is above your target, your doctor may change your treatment plan to get your level down. A combination of diet, exercise, and medication can help you get an optimal A1c level. If you do useinsulinor blood sugar-lowering drugs, your doctor will determine the best dose and schedule to manage your blood sugar level. However, changes to your diet and exercise habits may affect how much diabetes medication you need because both influence your blood sugar level. Here are some tips to help you eat well and exercise safely. Diet The foods you eat affect your blood sugar level, so you have to plan carefully. This involves: Moderating carbohydrates.Carbs are usually the leading culprit behind blood sugar boosts. Knowing exactly how much youâll consume helps manage your blood sugar level and, if you use insulin, it helps you calculate your dose. Knowing the proper portion size.Figure out the right portion for the foods you plan to eat, then measure them as precisely as you can. Eating balanced meals.Your plate should combine protein, carbs, and fat from healthy sources such as fruits, vegetables, and other foods that are good for you. Talk to your doctor or a diabetes dietitian about meal planning and how to coordinate your meals with your diabetes medications. Skipping sugary drinks.These provide no nutrition but spike your blood sugar. Avoid them except when you need to quickly recover from low blood sugar. Exercise Your body burns blood sugar for fuel when you work out, and regular exercise helpsinsulindo its job of managing the blood sugar in your body. Vigorous workouts provide the most benefits, but lighter physical activities, such as walking, gardening, and simply being on your feet rather than the couch, also help. Aim for at least 30 minutes a day on at least 5 days a week. Here are some tips: Get advice.Talk to your doctor before you start a new exercise program. Together, you can come up with a plan that will be both beneficial and safe. Set a schedule.Exercise impacts your blood sugar, so you should coordinate it with both your meal times and medication schedule. Your doctor can help you set an effective schedule as well as tell you what blood sugar level you should target. Check your levels.Exercise can lower your blood sugar, but it's crucial to prevent it from dropping too low. Check your blood sugar before, during, and after you exercise. This is particularly important if you are on insulin or any blood sugar-lowering drugs. You may need a small snack before you work out or while you exercise to prevent low blood sugar. Finally, know the signs oflow blood sugar: feeling shaky, weak, tired, hungry, lightheaded, irritable, anxious, or confused. You may need to alter your insulin or medication in order to account for the impact that exercise can have on your blood sugar level. Drink water.You need to stay hydrated while you are active to prevent a rise in your blood sugar level. How much can your A1c drop in 3 months? The answer to that question is different for everyone and depends on lots of factors. Making healthy changes to your diet and adding regular exercise to your routine are two major components of getting your A1c down â and keeping it down. A reasonable goal is to maintain your A1c between 7% and 8%. Some people can bring it down even further, to 6.5% or lower. Your doctor can help you decide the best goal for you to set. A lot of factors can throw off the accuracy of your A1c results. One of these is the type of hemoglobin you have. This is determined by your genes. Hemoglobin A is the most common type, but you may have another type â called a hemoglobin variant â if you are Hispanic or of West African or Southeast Asian descent. Having a hemoglobin variant may affect your test results. A blood test can be done to learn what type of hemoglobin you have. This is important to know so that the lab accurately analyzes your A1c. There are other factors as well that can make your A1c results appear lower or higher than they actually are. Falsely low results Some health conditions and other factors can cause your A1c test results to be lower than they actually are. They include: Falsely high results An artificially high A1c test result can be caused by any of the following factors: Your doctor probably will have you take the A1c test as soon as youâre diagnosed with diabetes. Youâll also have the test if your doctor thinks you may get diabetes. The test will set a baseline level so you can see how well youâre controlling your blood sugar. How often youâll need the test after that depends on several things, such as: Youâll probably get tested once a year if you have prediabetes, which means you have a strong chance of developing diabetes. You may get tested twice each year if you havetype 2 diabetes, you don't use insulin, and your blood sugar level is usually in your target range. You could get it three or four times each year if you havetype 1 diabetes. You may also need the test more often if your diabetes plan changes or if you start a new medicine. You donât have to go to your doctorâs office to take your A1c test. You can do it at home. For some people, such as those who live in rural areas far from a health care provider, at-home tests offer a welcome alternative to driving to the doctorâs office. Their use greatly expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic as telemedicine grew in popularity. Research does suggest, however, that at least some at-home A1c tests are not quite as accurate as the tests done in your doctorâs office. Ask your doctor which tests are the most reliable. Some at-home A1c tests, called rapid tests, will give you results within a few minutes, while others require you to mail your blood sample to a lab for analysis. Results for mail-in tests take at least a few days to become available. Below are some basic instructions so you know what to expect. Each test is going to be somewhat different from the others, so be sure to carefully read and follow the instructions that come with your kit. For rapid tests: For mail-in tests: Some mail-in kits collect blood on a card rather than in a tube. The instructions provided in your kit will walk you through the process. As with other blood tests, the A1c test presents no real risks. The spot where the blood was drawn may become tender or bruised, but this typically clears up quickly. The A1c test is a valuable tool for diagnosing and managing diabetes, but itâs not perfect. As detailed above, itâs not always accurate. Another limitation is that it does not tell you how your blood sugar level fluctuates throughout the day, week, or month. Such fluctuations are particularly common in type 1 diabetes. Because the test only gives an average blood sugar level over the previous 3 months, your result could be the same whether your blood sugar fluctuates a lot or stays steady. Why is that important? Your goal is to keep your blood sugar level in your desired range as much as possible. Your "time in range" numbers provide a better picture of how well you manage your diabetes day to day and week to week. The A1c was not designed to do that. For that, you need a continuous glucose monitor, which tracks your glucose level 24/7. The A1c test is a blood test that measures your blood sugar level over the previous 3 months. It plays an important part in diagnosing and managing diabetes. If you have diabetes, expect to take an A1c test at least twice a year. But keep in mind that some health conditions and other factors can affect its accuracy. You may need to use additional means, such as a continuous glucose monitor, to keep close track of your blood sugar level from day to day. What does a hemoglobin A1c test measure? This test measures your average blood sugar (aka blood glucose) level over the previous 3 months. It is used to diagnose and manage diabetes. What is a normal A1c range by age? A1c tests calculate the percentage of blood sugar in your bloodstream. The normal range, meaning you donât have diabetes, is below 5.7%. That normal range remains the same no matter your age. Does a high A1c level mean I have diabetes? Maybe. If you have no symptoms of diabetes when you take the test, your doctor will schedule a follow-up A1c test to confirm the result. Also, several health conditions and other factors can make the A1c test less accurate, potentially causing falsely high or falsely low results. Your doctor should consider these factors when evaluating your A1c test result. What happens if your hemoglobin is low?Â Low levels of hemoglobin keep your body from delivering enough oxygen to tissues. As a result, you feel tired and weak, and your body canât function like it should. What happens if your hemoglobin is high?Â High levels of hemoglobin thicken your blood. This keeps it from flowing as easily, which means your organs canât get the amount of oxygen they need. You may get headaches, dizziness, blurred or double vision, itching, and blood clots.Â Is high or low hemoglobin bad?Â Yourhemoglobinlevels give your doctor important information about the health of your red blood cells. Both high and low levels of hemoglobin can be signs that your tissues and organs arenât getting the oxygen they need. They can also indicate underlying problems. Is high hemoglobin something to worry about? Some causes of high hemoglobin can be serious, such as bone marrow disease, congenital heart disease, heart failure, and scarred lungs. But other factors that can cause it include time spent at a high altitude and dehydration. Your doctor can test you for conditions that may be raising your hemoglobin levels. What causes hemoglobin to be a little high?Â Most often, high hemoglobin happens because your blood oxygen levels have been low for some time. This might be because of an illness or injury. Your doctor will examine you and may do tests to find out whatâs behind your high hemoglobin levels. SOURCES: American Diabetes Association: âA1C Test,â âA1C and eAG.â Clinical Chemistry.

Serena Valentine was diagnosed with diabetes on Nov. 29, 2003. Â Initially, she was misdiagnosed with type 1 diabetes due to her young age. However, 5 years later, she discovered that she was living with type 2 diabetes. Valentine is the executive director of CORE Initiative, a nonprofit organization in Houston, TX. Â She volunteers with the American Diabetes Association as a âFocus on Diabetesâ Champion. Her mantra is, âThe change that we want to see must begin with us!â You can reach her onLinkedIn,Instagram, and herwebsite. Most of us donât think of food as being a substance that we can abuse. But our feelings can cause us to lose control of our food choices until it becomes just that that.

When you hear people talk about substance abuse, mostÂ of us think of drugs and alcohol. MostÂ people donât even think of food as being a substance that we can abuse.Â But our feelings can cause us to lose control of our food choices until they become just that. Emotional eating is a way to calm or suppress these negative feelings, such as anger, stress, fear, sadness, loneliness, and boredom.Â Itâs different for everyone, but major life changes, the struggles of daily life, and unresolved traumas may trigger you into emotional eating. When this happens, food choices may include foods that are not so healthy. This can lead to higher blood glucose levels, especially for people living with diabetes. Iâve had my own struggles with emotional eating ever since I could remember.Â My food choices, eating frequency, and food portions were often determined by how I felt when it was time to eat. This happened with extreme emotions on both ends of the spectrum. If I was really sad, upset, or stressed, I would eat, and it would never be anything healthy. Also, if I was really happy and in a celebratory mood, I would celebrate with food, and this too was never with anything good for me.Â Iâve mentioned before that I received my diabetes diagnosis at age 20. This doesnât mean that my bad eating habits stopped at that point. I carried them with me and tried to manage the condition effectively with this bad eating behavior.Â Over the years, a pattern developed: Iâd be doing well with my diabetes management, and then out of nowhere, a bad, stressful day would happen. As this day went by, my eating choices got worse, and they came one after another. Then, the regret settled in after I checked my blood glucose level and it was higher than normal.Â At this point, my body was feeling fatigued, my mind became just as exhausted, and all I could say was,Â âI guess Iâll try again tomorrow.â Imagine that youâre locked into this cycle. What about those times when your emotions last more than a day? One day of regret turns into a monthlongÂ â or longerÂ â binge. With your three-month checkup coming soon, you hate to have to explain to your doctor why your A1c has gone up this time. You just know for sure that your doctor is going to try to increase your dose of medications.Â You donât want that to happen because you donât want to take the medication anyway. But youâre too ashamed to tell them what really happened, because the truth of the matter is that it makes you feel ashamed of yourself. You didnât want to do it, but this was the only way for you to cope with your circumstances without anyone else knowing about it. This was my life over and over and over again for years. I began to have a lot of complications, until in May 2019, I experienced the most life-changing diabetes complication of my life. I was completely blind for nine months.Â At that point, every negative emotion that you could possibly think of came to live with me with the intention of staying there forever.Â I guess your next question is, how did I get past it? I canât tell you the trouble without telling you how I overcame it.Â There was no theatrical âhappeningâ or some dramatic scene that made me quit. I simply remember thinking that I was just tired of being depressed and allowing my emotions to take over my life.Â When I thought of my triumphant moments during my journey with diabetes, I immediately began to think of patterns that threw me off course every time.Â Each time that I allowed my emotions to get the best of me, I relied on food to be my pick-me-up.Â Not only could my mind not take it anymore, but now my body couldnât take it anymore either. It made me want to get rid of this horrible eating behavior because I still had dreams, aspirations, a purpose-driven life to live, and a beautiful son who was watching my every move. It was an uphill battle with deciding not to buy unhealthy foods and not to eat too late in the evening, but most importantly what I should do when I have negative emotions. I begin to find other things to do, like calling a loved one. They probably didnât know what I was doing then, but I guess they know now! Also, I developed a habitÂ of exercising when I felt stressed. Even if I couldnât exercise at that moment, I became better at calming myself down until I could take it out on my body in a good way. The act of intentional breathing became my best friend as well. Deep breathing can help to relax your body to slow a rapid heart rate and rapid breathing in minutes.Â Last but not least, it all boils down to the decision not to overeat, despite my cravings and what I felt my mind was telling me to do. This has taken years of practice. Sometimes, it still crosses my mind, but when I see how far I have come, I never want to go back to that dark place ever again. Are your food choices dependent upon how you feel? For those of you who may be dealing with this eating behavior, you can break free from it. It started with you, so it should end with you. Never give up. Whatever you do, keep hope alive!

Also, if I was really happy and in a celebratory mood, I would celebrate with food, and this too was never with anything good for me.Â Iâve mentioned before that I received my diabetes diagnosis at age 20. This doesnât mean that my bad eating habits stopped at that point. I carried them with me and tried to manage the condition effectively with this bad eating behavior.Â Over the years, a pattern developed: Iâd be doing well with my diabetes management, and then out of nowhere, a bad, stressful day would happen. As this day went by, my eating choices got worse, and they came one after another. Then, the regret settled in after I checked my blood glucose level and it was higher than normal.Â At this point, my body was feeling fatigued, my mind became just as exhausted, and all I could say was,Â âI guess Iâll try again tomorrow.â Imagine that youâre locked into this cycle. What about those times when your emotions last more than a day? One day of regret turns into a monthlongÂ â or longerÂ â binge. With your three-month checkup coming soon, you hate to have to explain to your doctor why your A1c has gone up this time. You just know for sure that your doctor is going to try to increase your dose of medications.Â You donât want that to happen because you donât want to take the medication anyway. But youâre too ashamed to tell them what really happened, because the truth of the matter is that it makes you feel ashamed of yourself. You didnât want to do it, but this was the only way for you to cope with your circumstances without anyone else knowing about it. This was my life over and over and over again for years. I began to have a lot of complications, until in May 2019, I experienced the most life-changing diabetes complication of my life. I was completely blind for nine months.Â At that point, every negative emotion that you could possibly think of came to live with me with the intention of staying there forever.Â I guess your next question is, how did I get past it? I canât tell you the trouble without telling you how I overcame it.Â There was no theatrical âhappeningâ or some dramatic scene that made me quit. I simply remember thinking that I was just tired of being depressed and allowing my emotions to take over my life.Â When I thought of my triumphant moments during my journey with diabetes, I immediately began to think of patterns that threw me off course every time.Â Each time that I allowed my emotions to get the best of me, I relied on food to be my pick-me-up.Â Not only could my mind not take it anymore, but now my body couldnât take it anymore either. It made me want to get rid of this horrible eating behavior because I still had dreams, aspirations, a purpose-driven life to live, and a beautiful son who was watching my every move. It was an uphill battle with deciding not to buy unhealthy foods and not to eat too late in the evening, but most importantly what I should do when I have negative emotions. I begin to find other things to do, like calling a loved one. They probably didnât know what I was doing then, but I guess they know now! Also, I developed a habitÂ of exercising when I felt stressed. Even if I couldnât exercise at that moment, I became better at calming myself down until I could take it out on my body in a good way. The act of intentional breathing became my best friend as well. Deep breathing can help to relax your body to slow a rapid heart rate and rapid breathing in minutes.Â Last but not least, it all boils down to the decision not to overeat, despite my cravings and what I felt my mind was telling me to do. This has taken years of practice. Sometimes, it still crosses my mind, but when I see how far I have come, I never want to go back to that dark place ever again. Are your food choices dependent upon how you feel? For those of you who may be dealing with this eating behavior, you can break free from it. It started with you, so it should end with you. Never give up. Whatever you do, keep hope alive!

A few years ago, I remember how tough it was just to climb a flight of stairs or get up from the couch. My knees hurt, plain and simple. Walking across a parking lot felt horrible. I was wearing knee braces just to make it through a workout or a simple walk around the neighborhood. At 48, I felt way older than I should have. At the time, I weighed 268 pounds and was living with type 2 diabetes. I didnât always make the connection between my weight, my eating habits, and the pain I felt in my kneesâbut looking back, itâs crystal clear. The inflammation was real, and my lifestyle was feeding it. I was consuming foods that did my body no favorsâprocessed carbs, sugary drinks, late-night snacks. I thought I was managing things okay, but my body was telling a different story. My knees, especially, were the first to sound the alarm. If youâve ever struggled with knee pain, you know how discouraging it can be. It wears you downânot just physically, but mentally too. You start avoiding movement. You dread stairs. You hesitate before getting up, because you know whatâs coming. And maybe like me, youâve reached for braces or wraps just to help you get through the day. But hereâs what I want you to know: things can get better. When I finally decided to make a change, I wasnât chasing perfectionâI was chasing relief. I wanted to move without pain. I wanted to walk up a flight of stairs without feeling like I was hauling two sandbags on my knees. I wanted to be able to work out without feeling like my joints were working against me. So I got serious. I changed my eating habits, cut out processed foods, and started focusing on real, whole foods that helped reduce inflammation. I started walking more â just a little at first, because thatâs all my knees could handle. Over time, I added in strength training, mobility work, and regular exercise routines. Slowly but surely, the weight came off. I lost more than 80 pounds â not through crash dieting or gimmicks, but by choosing better habits and sticking with them. And something powerful happened: My knees stopped hurting. I donât wear braces anymore. I run. I lift. I move freely. Iâve even completed two marathons and several other races since my health turned around. And Iâm not saying that to impress you. Iâm saying that because I know someone reading this is in the place I used to be. I know what itâs like to be frustrated with your body, to feel stuck, and to wonder if itâs too late to change. Itâs not. Now, let me be clear: Iâm not a doctor. I donât know your specific condition. So before making any major changes, talk to your physician. But also â talk to yourself. Be honest. Are your current habits helping or hurting you? Are there small steps you can take today to reduce inflammation, lose even a little weight, and strengthen the muscles around your knees? Iâve seen people bounce back from knee surgery and sports injuries to regain full mobility. So even if youâve already had surgery, that doesnât have to be the end of your story either. But if you can avoid surgery altogether by making a few lifestyle changes now, wouldnât that be worth it? Our knees carry a lot, physically and metaphorically. When they hurt, life gets harder. But you have more control than you might think. If youâre overweight and dealing with chronic pain, itâs not just about numbers on a scale, itâs about freeing your body from the pressure it was never meant to carry. Iâm now in my 50s, and I feel better than I did in my 40s. I donât take that lightly. Iâm grateful. And I want that for you too. So take it one step at a time. Literally. One step without the brace. One healthy meal. One walk. One choice that leans into healing rather than pain. Your knees â and your future self â will thank you for it.

Diabetes is a disease that involves problems with the way your body makes or manages the hormone insulin. It's also known as diabetes mellitus. Normally, your pancreas (an organ behind the stomach) releases insulin to help your body store and use the sugar and fat from the food you eat.Â Diabetes happens because of one of the following: Diabetes is a lifelong disease. About 38.4 million Americans have the disease and one quarter (or approximately 8.7 million) are unaware that they have it. An additional 97.6 million people have prediabetes. As yet, there is no cure. People with diabetes need to manage their disease to stay healthy. When you have diabetes, it's important to keep track of your blood sugar levels. A continuous glucose monitor is one tool to help people with type 1 diabetes know how much insulin they need. (Photo Credit: VLAYKO/Getty Images) To understand why insulin is important in diabetes, it helps to know more about how your body uses food for energy. Your body is made up of millions of cells. To make energy, these cells need food in a very simple form. When you eat or drink, much of your food is broken down into a simple sugar called "glucose." Then, glucose is transported through your bloodstream to the cells of your body where it can be used to provide some of the energy your body needs for daily activities. The amount of glucose in your bloodstream is regulated by the hormone insulin. Insulin is always being released in small amounts by your pancreas. When the amount of glucose in your blood rises to a certain level, your pancreas will release more insulin to push more glucose into your cells. This causes your blood glucose level to drop. To keep it from getting too low (hypoglycemiaor low blood sugar), your body signals you to eat and releases some glucose stored in your liver. People with diabetes either don't make insulin or their body's cells are resistant to insulin, leading to high levels of sugar circulating in the blood, called simply high blood sugar. By definition, diabetes is having a blood glucose level of 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or more after an overnight fast (not eating anything). Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes happens because the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas (called beta cells) are destroyed by the immune system. People withtype 1 diabetesproduce no insulin and must use insulin injections to control their blood sugar. Symptoms most commonly start in people under the age of 20 but can develop at any age. Type 2 diabetes Unlike people with type 1 diabetes, people with type 2 diabetes produce insulin. However, either it isn't enough or their body is resistant to the insulin. In that situation, not enough glucose gets into the body's cells and it builds up in the bloodstream. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, affecting more than 36 million Americans. It's the leading cause of diabetes-related complications such as blindness, amputations, and chronic kidney failure requiringdialysis. Type 2 diabetes usually happens in people over age 40 who are overweight, but it can also affect those who aren't overweight. Sometimes referred to as "adult-onset diabetes," type 2 diabetes has started to appear more often in children because of the rise in obesity in young people. Some people can manage their type 2 diabetes by losing weight, watching their diet, and exercising regularly. Others may also need to take insulin injections or a pill that helps their body use insulin better. Prediabetes In the U.S., 97.6 million adults have blood sugar levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. This is calledprediabetes, or impaired glucose tolerance. People with prediabetes usually have no symptoms, but itâs almost always there before a person develops type 2 diabetes. Some complications, such as heart disease, can begin even when a person has only prediabetes. Talk to your doctor to see if you need to be tested for prediabetes. You may be able to prevent type 2 diabetes and lower your risk of complications. Gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes is triggered by pregnancy. Hormone changes during pregnancy can affect insulin's ability to work properly. The condition happens in up to 9% of all pregnancies. You have an increased risk of developing gestational diabetes if you're over 25 years old, were overweight before your pregnancy, have a family history of diabetes, or are Hispanic, Black, Native American, or Asian. You'll get screened for gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Left untreated, high blood sugar increases the risk of complications for both you and your child. Usually, blood sugar levels return to normal within 6 weeks of childbirth. However, having hadgestational diabetesincreases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Type 3 diabetes Some researchers have suggested that Alzheimer's disease is a form of diabetes that affects the brain, and propose calling it type 3 diabetes. They point to evidence that people with Alzheimer's have insulin resistance in their brains. The connection hasn't been proven, however, and most doctors don't use the term. Other types of diabetes There are several less common forms of diabetes, including: Monogenic diabetes.This includes several different types of diabetes caused by a gene mutation you inherit from one or both of your parents. When it appears in babies, it's called neonataldiabetes mellitus. In older children and young adults, it's called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Type 3c diabetes.This can develop if you've had your pancreas removed, or if it's damaged by illness or injury. Other types can come from taking steroid medications, having cystic fibrosis, or having certain rare inherited illnesses. The symptoms of type 1 diabetes often come on suddenly and can be severe. They include: The symptoms of type 2 diabetes may be the same as those of type 1. Most often, there are no symptoms or a very slow development of the above symptoms. Other symptoms may include: With gestational diabetes, there are often no symptoms. Or you might notice: By itself, pregnancy can make you pee more often and feel hungrier, so these symptoms donât always mean you have gestational diabetes. But it's important to get tested to avoid problems for both you and your baby. If you're having symptoms, you should be tested for the disease. Your doctor may also suggest screening if you're at higher risk. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends you get screened if you're between 35 and 70 years old and have overweight or obesity. Diabetes is diagnosedby measuring the amount of glucose in your blood. You'll typically need to have high levels on two separate days to get a diagnosis. If you have the disease, measuring your blood sugar is important for keeping it under control. There are several kinds of tests used. A1c test (glycated hemoglobin) This test measures the average of your blood sugar levels over 2-3 months. A result of 6.5% or higher means you have diabetes. A level between 5.7% and 6.4% is considered prediabetes. You'll be retested regularly to see whether your treatment plan is working. Fasting blood sugar test For this test, you won't be able to eat or drink anything but water for 8 hours before you have your blood drawn. A result of 126 mg/dL or more indicates diabetes. Between 100 mg/dL and 125 mg/dL is prediabetes. Random blood sugar test This test can be done at any time, whether you've eaten or not. You may get it if you're havingsymptoms of diabetesand doctors think it would be dangerous to wait for a fasting test. With this test, 200 mg/dL is considered too high. Glucose tolerance test This test takes place over 2 hours, and you'll also have to fast for 8 hours first. Your blood is drawn, and then you drink a very sweet liquid. Your blood is drawn again at 1 hour and 2 hours, and the three results are compared to see how your body manages the sugar. A result above 200 mg/dL at 2 hours means you have diabetes. A level between 140 mg/dL and 199 mg/dL is prediabetes. A different version of this test that doesn't require you to fast can be used to screen for gestational diabetes. If the result is high, you'll get a more extensive test. Autoantibody test This blood test doesn't measure your blood sugar, but it looks for certain immune system proteins that indicate you have type 1 rather than type 2 diabetes. You might get it if a blood sugar test is high, or if you have a parent or sibling with the disease. Urine ketone test When you have diabetes, you may need to test your urine for ketones from time to time. These are substances your body makes when it has to use fat rather than glucose for fuel. This can happen when you're low on insulin. Ketones in your urine are a sign of a dangerous condition called ketoacidosis, which needs immediate treatment. To take the test, you pee in a cup and dip a strip of a special paper into it. The paper changes color to show the level of ketones. There's no cure for diabetes, but it can be managed and controlled. The goals of managing diabetes are to: Treatment depends on what type of diabetes you have. It often includes a combination of medications, diet strategies, and lifestyle changes. An important part of treatment is keeping track of your blood sugar levels. People with type 1 and some people with type 2 diabetes need to test themselves several times a day to make sure their level stays within their target range and take action if it's too high or too low. This might be done by pricking your finger to get a small drop of blood or wearing a monitor that constantly measures your blood sugar through your skin. People with prediabetes and some people with type 2 diabetes only need their blood tested during checkups, which may be once or several times a year. Diabetes medications You may take medication several times a day, or on a daily or weekly schedule. Insulin.People with type 1 diabetes and some people with type 2 use insulin to allow their cells to absorb glucose. You inject this medication under your skin with a needle and syringe or a special pen. Your doctor will tell you when and how often to take insulin, but it's usually before meals. You could also wear a pump that delivers a steady dose throughout the day. Insulin is safe to take if you have gestational diabetes. Oral medications.Many people with type 2 diabetes take medication in pill form once or twice a day. You may take a combination of more than one type. These are among the most common: Other medications you take by mouth work with your digestion, slowing the breakdown of starches so your blood sugar stays steady. GLP-1 and GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists.Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide are naturally occurring hormones that tell your body to release insulin, slow the rate at which food moves out of your stomach, and send signals to your brain that make you feel full. These drugs mimic the action of those hormones, which helps lower your blood sugar. One medication comes as a pill, while the others you inject under your skin either once a week or once or twice a day. The FDA-approved GLP-1 receptor agonists for type 2 diabetes are: Tirzepatide is the only approved dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist. Other medications.To help prevent some of the complications that can come from from diabetes, your doctor may also prescribe blood pressure or cholesterol medications, or low-dose aspirin. Diabetes and diet What and when you eat plays an important part in controlling your blood glucose levels. Certain foods, such as sweets, soft drinks, and refined grains like white bread, are digested very quickly and cause your blood sugar to spike. Skipping a meal can make your blood sugar drop too low. When you have type 1 diabetes, you need to understand how the things you eat and drink affect your blood sugar, so you can be sure to get the right amount of insulin to stay in your target range. Your doctor will teach you to track nutrients, especially carbohydrates, and adjust your insulin doses. For everyone with diabetes or prediabetes, following a healthy diet can help you control your blood sugar, cholesterol, blood pressure, and weight. That includes: Things to limit or avoid include: Diabetes and exercise Physical activity helps your body use insulin better, which lowers your blood sugar. It can also help you keep your blood pressure and cholesterol down and manage your weight. Doctors recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise 5 days every week, plus 2 days of strength training. That can be walking at a brisk pace, swimming, or even dancing. Pick something you enjoy and will stick with, and check with your doctor before you start an exercise program. If you have type 1 diabetes, you may need to change your insulin dose or eat more carbs when you exercise so your blood sugar doesn't drop too low. Diabetes home remedies You hold the key to managing your diabetes. Take these steps to help control your blood sugar and prevent complications: Remember: What you do at home every day affects your blood sugar more than what your doctor can do every few months during your checkups. While you can't prevent type 1 diabetes, you can make lifestyle changes that will lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Ask your doctor if medications such asmetforminor weight loss drugs might be helpful. Diabetes is a disease in which your body has problems either making or using insulin. That leads to too much glucose (sugar) in your blood, which can cause serious health problems. You can lower your risk for the most common type, type 2 diabetes, by losing weight, being physically active, and following a healthy eating plan. Ask your doctor if you should have a screening blood sugar test. Can diabetes be reversed? People with type 2 diabetes can lower their blood sugar to levels that are no longer in the range of diabetes. Doctors call this remission. It's usually accomplished by losing weight. But type 2 diabetes can come back. Type 1 diabetes can't be reversed. If I have type 2 diabetes and take insulin, do I have to take it forever? Not necessarily. For some people, insulin is a short-term treatment to quickly lower your blood sugar. If diet, exercise, weight loss, and other medications bring your blood glucose levels under control, you may be able to stop taking insulin. Do sugary drinks cause diabetes? Not directly, but a study published in 2019 found an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes for people who drank 4 ounces of sugar-sweetened drinks, including soft drinks and juice, every day. Sugar from any source raises your blood sugar level. Over time, blood sugar that's too high makes your body less sensitive to insulin. How can I flush sugar out of my system fast? Taking fast-acting insulin, drinking water, and exercising can help lower your blood sugar quickly. But exercise is dangerous if you have ketoacidosis, so test your urine for ketones first if your blood sugar level is high. Call your doctor to find out if you need emergency treatment.

Diabetes happens when your blood sugar (blood glucose), which is your body's primary energy source, is too high. There are two types of diabetes: Extreme thirst is one of the most common early symptoms of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images) Bothtypes of diabeteshave some of the same telltale warning signs. Increased hunger Your body converts the food you eat into glucose, which your cells use for energy. But your cells need insulin to take in glucose. If your body doesn't make enough or any insulin, or if your cells resist the insulin your body makes, the glucose can't get into them and you have no energy. This can make you hungrier than usual. Fatigue and tiredness A lack of insulin and glucose can also make you more tired than usual. Peeing more often The average person usually has to pee about four to seven times in 24 hours, but people with diabetes may go a lot more. Why? Normally, your body reabsorbs glucose as it passes through your kidneys. But when diabetes pushes yourblood sugarup, your kidneys may not be able to bring it all back in. This causes the body to make more urine, and that takes fluids. The result: You'll have to go more often. You might pee out more, too. Frequent thirst Because you're peeing so much, you can get very thirsty. Dry mouth Because your body is using fluids to make pee, there's less moisture for other things. You could get dehydrated, and your mouth may feel dry. Itchy and dry skin Your skin could also feel dry, which may start to itch as well. Blurred vision Changing fluid levels in your body could cause the lenses in your eyes to swell. They would then change shape and be unable to focus. Unintentional weight loss If your body can't get energy from your food, it will start burning muscle and fat for energy instead. You may lose weight even though you haven't changed how you eat. Can diabetes cause headaches? Headache may be a symptom ofhypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. It happens when your sugar or glucose level drops very low. How can you tell if you have diabetes? Most early symptoms are due to higher-than-normal glucose levels in your blood. While symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the same, there's a difference in how they appear. Intype 1 diabetes, symptoms show up quickly, in just a few days or weeks, especially in children. The four most common symptoms are: Type 2diabetes symptomsmay be mild and develop more slowly, especially early on in the disease. It's possible to go for years without realizing you have the condition. There's no major difference in early diabetes signs between men and women, but there may be a few contrasts. Women with the condition may have vaginal yeast infections and urinary tract infections more often, while men with untreated diabetes tend to lose muscle mass. Early symptoms of type 1 diabetes in children Type 1 diabetes can happen at any age but tends to crop up in children aged 5 to 6 and 11 to 13. Researchers think this is due to hormones at these ages. Symptoms include: Early symptoms of type 2 diabetes in children Adults are more likely to get type 2 diabetes, but the disease is happening more often in kids because of obesity. Your child may not show any symptoms of the disease, but here are some to look out for: High blood sugar duringpregnancyusually has no symptoms. You might feel a little thirstier than normal, have to pee more often, have a dry mouth, or feel tired. If you have an average chance of gettinggestational diabetes, your doctor will likely screen you for the condition between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. But your doctor may test you early in your pregnancy, possibly at your first prenatal visit, if: The screening involves drinking a sugary solution and having your blood sugar tested an hour later. If your blood sugar is high, you'll need a follow-up test, where you'll drink a stronger solution and have yourblood sugar testedevery hour for 3 hours. Signs of type 2 diabetes complications may include: Learn about what you can do to lower your risk of diabetes complications. If you're older than 45 or have other risks for diabetes, it's important to get tested. When you spot the condition early, you can avoid nerve damage,hearttrouble, and other complications. As a general rule, call your doctor if you: Diabetes often starts with mild symptoms such as feeling very hungry and tired, needing to pee a lot, being very thirsty, having a dry mouth, itchy skin, and blurry vision. Type 1 diabetes symptoms appear quickly and are more severe, whiletype 2 symptomsdevelop slowly. It's important to see a doctor if you have symptoms or have a higher chance of getting diabetes to avoid serious health problems.

Not everyone withtype 2 diabetesis overweight, but obesity and an inactive lifestyle are two of the most common causes of type 2 diabetes. These things are responsible for about 90%-95% of diabetes cases in the U.S. When you're healthy, your pancreas (an organ behind your stomach) releases insulin to help your body store and use sugar from the food you eat. Diabetes happens when one or more of the following happens: Unlike people with type 1 diabetes, people with type 2 diabetes do makeinsulin. But the insulin their pancreas releases isnât enough, or their body can't recognize and use the insulin properly. (Doctors call this insulin resistance.) When there isn't enough insulin orit isn't used as it should be,Â glucoseÂ (a type of sugar) can't enteryour cells. It builds up in your bloodstream instead. This can damage many areas of the body. Also, because cells aren't getting the glucose they need, they don't work the way they should. Weight and diabetes When you're overweight, you're at a higher risk for type 2 diabetes. This is especially true if your extra weight is in your belly. Extra weight leads to insulin resistance and dysfunction of specific cells in your body. One measure of obesity is body mass index (BMI), which estimates body fat based on weight and height. For men and those assigned male at birth who are older than 18, the lifetime risk of getting type 2 diabetes with a BMI of 18.5 or lower is 7%. The risk increases as your BMI increases. If your BMI is higher than 35, your risk of type 2 diabetes is 70%. For women and those assigned female at birth who are older than 18, the diabetes risk at 18.5 BMI is 12%, which grows to 74% with a BMI of 35 or greater. Losing 5%-10% of your overall body weight can improve your odds. Diet and diabetes Everything you eat affects your blood sugar levels. But foods that are high in simple carbohydrates, fat, and calories have a significant impact. Studies have found that eating lots of red meat, sweets, and fried food can lead to insulin resistance. Eating too much of these foods also contributes to weight gain, which increases your chances of diabetes. Diabetes and metabolic syndrome When you have metabolic syndrome, you have a set of risk factors that are linked to heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Those things include: Most people with metabolic syndrome have insulin resistance. Diabetes and PCOS When you have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), small cysts develop on your ovaries. Experts aren't really sure what causes PCOS, but weight and genes may play a role. Many people with PCOS have insulin resistance, which puts them at a higher risk for type 2 diabetes. Medications causing diabetes Some medicines you take for other conditions can make your blood sugar spike. The types of drugs linked to diabetes include: Gestational diabetesÂ This is a type of diabetes that begins when you're pregnant. Experts aren't exactly sure what causes it, though excess weight can play a role. The hormonal changes in your body during pregnancy may make it harder for your body to regulate your blood sugar. Usually, your blood sugar will return to normal once you've given birth. But gestational diabetes does raise your risk of having type 2 diabetes in the future. Your baby also has a higher risk of type 2 diabetes in the future. Smoking and diabetes If you smoke cigarettes, you're 30%-40% more likely to develop diabetes than a nonsmoker. The more you smoke, the more your risk increases. And when you have type 2 diabetes, smoking can make it harder to manage your condition and get your insulin dose right. Sleep and diabetes Sleep problems are associated with diabetes. If you don't get enough sleep, your body may not be sensitive enough to insulin. Disrupted sleep also can interfere with the hormones that control your body's glucose. One common sleep problem is sleep apnea, which is linked to obesity, another factor in diabetes. Diabetes itself can disturb your sleep -- for instance, if you have diabetes you may wake up often during the night to get a drink or pee. Many things can add to the risk of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes and family history Type 2 diabetes is believed to have a strong genetic link, meaning that it tends to run in families. If you have a parent, brother, or sister who has it, your chances are higher. Several genes may be related to type 2 diabetes. Health conditions related to diabetes If you have any of these conditions, you may want to ask your doctor about adiabetes test: Diabetes and race African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans are more likely to get type 2 diabetes than non-Hispanic whites. Diabetes and alcohol Drinking a lot of alcohol is linked to diabetes, though the relationship isn't entirely clear. Among other things, heavy drinking might cause you to gain weight, which is a risk factor for diabetes. LGBTQ and diabetes risk If you're lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer, you have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The reasons are complicated. Lesbian and bisexual women and transgender men are more likely to be overweight, a risk factor for diabetes. Studies suggest LGBTQ people may have more disrupted sleep, another factor that contributes to diabetes risk. Extra weight and disrupted sleep are both linked to long-term stress, and studies have found that LGBTQ people have extra stress in their lives because of their minority status. Other health conditions that may be more prevalent among LGBTQ people include HIV, PCOS, high blood pressure, heart disease, and kidney disease. All of these conditions can raise your diabetes risk. Diabetes and age The risk of type 2 diabetes begins to rise significantly around age 45 and rises considerably after age 65. Other risk factors Lifestyle issues can play a role in your diabetes risk. If you're not physically active, your risk goes up. Your risk also is increased if your diet is high in fat and simple carbohydrates. That can be the result of where you live and lack of access to healthy food.Â A proper diet andhealthy lifestyle habits, along with medication, can help you manage type 2 diabetes the same way you manage other areas of your life. Be sure to seek the latest information on this condition as you become your own health advocate. To understand why insulin is important, it helps to know more about how your body uses food for energy. Your body is made up of millions of cells. To make energy, these cells need food in a very simple form. When you eat or drink, much of the food is broken down into a simple sugar called glucose. It moves through your bloodstream to these cells, where it provides the energy your body needs for daily activities. Insulin and other hormones control the amount of glucose in your bloodstream. Your pancreas is always releasing small amounts of insulin. When the amount of glucose in your blood rises to a certain level, the pancreas will release more insulin to push more glucose into the cells. This causes the glucose levels in the blood (blood glucose levels) to drop. To keep blood glucose levels from getting too low (hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar), your body signals you to eat and releases some glucose from the stores kept in the liver. It also tells the body to release less insulin. People with diabetes either don't make insulin or their body's cells can no longer use their insulin. This leads to high blood sugar. By definition, diabetes is: When you have type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin, or it can't use the insulin it makes correctly. That causes glucose to build up in your blood, something that's called high blood sugar. The main causes of type 2 diabetes are obesity and an inactive lifestyle. But other conditions and even medicines you take can play a role. Many things can increase your risk of diabetes, including your family history, race, and age. What are the major risk factors for type 2 diabetes? Many things can increase your risk of diabetes, including your genes, age, and certain health conditions. Those include high blood pressure, high triglycerides, and low levels of HDL or "good" cholesterol. What are the causes of type 2 diabetes? The two main causes of type 2 diabetes are carrying excess weight -- especially in your belly -- and not getting enough exercise.

The following tests are used to diagnose diabetes: Ahemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testcan be done without fasting and can be used to diagnose or confirm either prediabetes or diabetes. If you get a positive test result, meaning you have diabetes or prediabetes, your doctor will confirm this by repeating the fasting plasma glucose test or theoral glucose tolerance teston a different day.Â Another test, thezinctransporter 8 autoantibody test, can help determine if a person has type 1 diabetes and not another type. This test is most reliable when done in the morning. The results and their meaning are shown in Table 1. If your fasting glucose level is 100 to 125 mg/dL, you have a form of prediabetes called impaired fasting glucose (IFG), meaning that you're more likely to develop type 2 diabetes but don't have it yet. A level of 126 mg/dL or above, confirmed by repeating the test on another day, means you have diabetes. Table 1. Fasting Plasma Glucose Test *Confirmed by repeating the test on a different day. Research has shown that the OGTT is more sensitive than the FPG test for diagnosing prediabetes, but it is less convenient to give. The OGTT requires you to fast for at least 8 hours before the test. Your plasma glucose is measured immediately before and 2 hours after you drink a liquid containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. Results and what they mean are shown in Table 2. If your blood sugar level is between 140 and 199 mg/dL 2 hours after drinking the liquid, you have a form of prediabetes called impaired glucose tolerance or IGT, meaning that you're more likely to developtype 2 diabetesbut don't have it yet. A 2-hour glucose level of 200 mg/dL or above, confirmed by repeating the test on another day, means that you have diabetes. Table 2. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test *Confirmed by repeating the test on a different day. Gestational diabetes is also diagnosed with the OGTT. Blood sugar levels are checked four times during the test. If yourblood sugar levelsare above normal at least twice during the test, you have gestational diabetes. Table 3 shows the above-normal results for the OGTT forgestational diabetes. Table 3. Gestational Diabetes: Above-Normal Results for the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test Note: Some laboratories use other numbers for this test. Glucose challenge test This test, also called the 1-hour glucose tolerance test, is a shorter version of the OGTT. This shorter test can better predict type 2 diabetes than other types of tests.Â Â If your blood glucose reading 1 hour after drinking the 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water is at or above 155 mg/dL, youâre considered to have intermediate hyperglycemia. If your blood glucose levels are greater than or equal to 209 mg/dL, you have type 2 diabetes.Â A random blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or more, plus presence of the following symptoms, can mean that you have diabetes: Other symptoms include fatigue, blurred vision, increasedhunger, and sores that don't heal. Your doctor will check your blood glucose level on another day using the FPG or the OGTT to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. Â This test tells you what percentage of your hemoglobin (the protein in your blood that carries oxygen) is coated with glucose. Your doctor gives you this test by using a needle to collect a sample of blood from your arm. The blood sample goes to a lab for results. YourHbA1creading gives your doctor a snapshot of your blood glucose control over several months. An HbA1c of 5.7% to 6.4% points to prediabetes and marks a time when it can be reversed by lifestyle changes. An HbA1c of 6.5% or higher is considered diabetes. Table 4. HbA1c Test HbA1c Diagnosis Below 5.7% Normal Between 5.7% and 6.4% Prediabetes 6.5% or higher Diabetes Â HbA1c tests donât diagnose type 1 or gestational diabetes, only type 2 diabetes.Â As your doctor collects data to confirm a diabetes diagnosis, these are the values they follow as a guideline: Table 5. Diagnostic Criteria for Prediabetes Test Result HbA1c 5.7-6.4% Fasting blood glucose 100-125 mg/dL 2-hour OGTT blood glucose 140-199 mg/dL Table 6. Diagnostic Criteria for Diabetes Test Result HbA1c 6.5% or higher Fasting blood glucose 126 mg/dL or higher 2-hour OGTT blood glucose 200 mg/dL or higher If your doctor confirms adiabetes diagnosis, they may want to do further tests to decide if you haveÂ type 1 diabetes. This is especially important for children and people who donât have other risk factors for diabetes who get a diabetes diagnosis.Â Autoantibody test.Your doctor may suggest a zinc transporter 8 autoantibody (ZnT8Ab) test. The goal of having thisÂ blood test is to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis that can lead to timely treatment. C-peptide test (Insulin in blood test).ÂThis test helps measure how muchinsulinyour pancreas is making. Your pancreas releases equal amounts of insulin and C-peptide into your bloodstream at the same time. C-peptide doesn't affect your blood glucose levels, but it stays in your blood longer than insulin. Your doctor will take a small sample of blood and send it to a lab for this test.Â Ketones.Â Your doctor can test your urine using a paper test strip to look for ketones. Ketones are acids your body makes when itâs usingfatinstead of glucose for energy. This can be a sign oftype 1 diabetes. There are many tests that confirm a diabetes diagnosis, including a fasting plasma glucose test, oral glucose tolerance test, random plasma glucose test, and hemoglobin A1c test. These tests tell your doctor if you have diabetes or are at risk of developing it (prediabetes). How do you diagnose diabetes?Your doctor can diagnose diabetes with blood tests. They may want to do more than one type to be sure of the diagnosis. If your doctor thinks you may have type 1 diabetes, they may do further tests on your blood to look for autoantibodies or look at your urine forketones.Â How do I accept a diabetes diagnosis?Learning you have diabetes can make you feel a range of emotions. Know that over 38 million Americans live with diabetes. There are many organizations and support groups to help with emotional health, diet management, and lifestyle tips to help you live well with diabetes.Â What should you do when first diagnosed with diabetes?Educate yourself on your condition so you feel empowered to take good care of yourself. Write down any questions you have and bring them with you to your doctor so you continue to understand more. Reach out to other people already living with diabetes for advice and support. Follow your treatment plan as your doctor directs.Â Â What do you say to a newly diagnosed diabetic person?If someone in your life gets a diabetes diagnosis, ask them how you can help them process the news. Be a good listener. Learn about diabetes yourself so you can be a helpful partner in conversation or in day-to-day life as they learn to manage it. Support from friends and family can help people with diabetes manage their condition better.Â How does a doctor diagnose diabetes type 1?After a diabetes diagnosis, there are further tests your doctor can use to see if you have type 1 diabetes.Â These include tests on your blood to look for autoantibodies, tests to see how much insulin your pancreas is making, or urine tests that look for ketones.Â SOURCES:Â American Diabetes Association:Â âDiabetes Diagnosis and Tests,â âNewly Diagnosed with Diabetes.âÂ National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.Â Medscape: âIs a 1-Hour Glucose Test Better at Predicting T2D Risk?â MedlinePlus: âHemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) Test,â âInsulin in Blood.â Mayo Clinic: âType 1 Diabetes.â CDC: âTesting for Diabetes,â âHelping Friends and Family With Diabetes.â Diabetes UK: âCoping with a Diabetes Diagnosis.â Â© 2005 - 2025 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

Your doctor may suspect you have diabetes if you have some risk factors for diabetes, or if you have high levels of blood sugar in your urine. Your blood sugar (also called blood glucose) levels may be high if your pancreas is producing little or no insulin (type 1 diabetes), or if the body is not responding normally to insulin (type 2 diabetes). Getting diagnosed begins with one of three tests. In most cases, your doctor will want to repeat a test that is high in order to confirm the diagnosis: Your doctor may also suggest a zinc transporter 8 autoantibody (ZnT8Ab) test. This blood test -- along with other information and test results -- can help determine if a person has type 1 diabetes instead of another type. The goal of having the ZnT8Ab test is a prompt and accurate diagnosis, and that can lead to timely treatment. Diabetes is a serious disease that you cannot treat on your own. Your doctor will help you make a diabetes treatment plan that is right for you -- and that you can understand. You may also need other health care professionals on your diabetes treatment team, including a foot doctor, nutritionist, eye doctor, and a diabetes specialist (called an endocrinologist). Treatment for diabetes requires keeping close watch over your blood sugar levels (and keeping them at a goal set by your doctor) with a combination of medications, exercise, and diet. By paying close attention to what and when you eat, you can minimize or avoid the "seesaw effect" of rapidly changing blood sugar levels, which can require quick changes in medication dosages, especially insulin.Â Find outhow to choose the right diabetes treatment for you. If you have type 1 diabetes, your pancreas no longer makes the insulin your body needs to use blood sugar for energy. You will need insulin in the form of injections or through use of a continuous pump. Learning to give injections to yourself or to your infant or child may at first seem the most daunting part of managing diabetes, but it is much easier thanÂ you think. Some people with diabetes use a computerized pump -- called aninsulin pump-- that gives insulin on a set basis. You and your doctor program the pump to deliver a certain amount of insulin throughout the day (the basal dose). Plus, you program the pump to deliver a certain amount of insulin based on your blood sugar level before you eat (bolus dose). Injectable insulin comes in five types: A rapid-actinginhaled insulin(Afrezza) is also FDA-approved for use before meals. It must be used in combination with long-acting insulin in patients withtype 1 diabetesand should not be used by those who smoke or have chronic lung disease. It comes as a single dose cartridge.Premixed insulin is also available for people who need to use more than one type of insulin. Insulin degludec (Tresiba) is a once-daily, long-acting insulin, providing a basal dose of insulin lasting beyond 42 hours. (It's the only basal insulin approved for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in patients as young as 1 year old.) It is also available in combination with rapid-acting insulin (Ryzodeg 70/30). Each treatment plan is tailored for the person and can be adjusted based on what you eat and how much you exercise, as well as for times of stress and illness. By checking your own blood sugar levels, you can track your body's changing needs for insulin and work with your doctor to figure out the best insulin dosage. People with diabetes check their blood sugar up to several times a day with an instrument called a glucometer. The glucometer measures glucose levels in a sample of your blood dabbed on a strip of treated paper. Also, there are now devices, called continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS), that can be attached to your body to measure your blood sugars every few minutes for up to a week at a time. But these machines check glucose levels from skin rather than blood, and they are less accurate than a traditional glucometer. For some people withtype 2 diabetes, diet and exercise are enough to keep the disease under control. Other people need medication, which may include insulin and an oral drug. Drugs for type 2 diabetes work in different ways to bring blood sugar levels back to normal. They include: Some pills contain more than one type of diabetes medication. They include the recently approvedempagliflozin/linagliptin(Glyxambi). It combines a SGLT2 inhibitor that blocks reabsorption of glucose into the kidneys with a DPP-4 inhibitor which increases hormones to help the pancreas produce more insulin and the liver produce less glucose. Eating a balanced diet is vital for people who have diabetes, so work with your doctor or dietitian to set up a menu plan. If you have type 1 diabetes, the timing of your insulin dosage is determined by activity and diet. When you eat and how much you eat are just as important as what you eat. Usually, doctors recommend three small meals and three to four snacks every day to maintain the proper balance between sugar and insulin in the blood. A healthy balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in your diet will help keep your blood glucose on target. How much of each will depend on many factors, including your weight and your personal preferences. Watching your carbohydrates -- knowing how much you need and how many you are eating -- is key to blood sugar control. If you are overweight, either a low-carbohydrate, low-fat/low calorie, or Mediterranean diet may help you get your weight to goal. No more than 7% of your diet should come from saturated fat, and you should try to avoid trans fats altogether. Try to fill half your plate with nonstarchy vegetables such as: Also, make sure to get some of these: You can also get protein from vegetarian options like tofu. Stick to whole-grain foods. If you eat cereals, check the ingredients and make sure whole grain is first on the list. Examples of whole grains include: In general, less-processed food is better. It has a lowerglycemic index, which means it may have less of an effect on your blood sugar. For example, oatmeal from whole oats has a lower glycemic index than instant oatmeal. If you have type 2 diabetes and follow a healthy diet and exercise routine, you could lose weight and improve your diabetes. One study found long-term weight loss through diet and exercise could lower your chances of having a stroke and dementia. Another crucial element in a treatment program for diabetes is exercise. With either type of diabetes, check with your doctor before starting an exercise program. Exercise improves your body's use of insulin and may lower blood sugar levels. To prevent your blood sugar from falling to dangerously low levels, check your blood sugar and, if necessary, eat a carbohydrate snack about half an hour before exercising. If you start to feel symptoms of low blood sugar (called hypoglycemia), stop exercising and have a carbohydrate snack or drink. Wait 15 minutes and check again. Have another snack again if it is still too low. Exercise helps some people with type 2 diabetes lower their blood glucose levels and may help prevent the disease in those at risk. For people with either type of diabetes, exercise can lower the chance of having a heart attack or stroke and can improve circulation. It may offer stress relief, as well. People with type 2 diabetes who need to lose weight can benefit from moderate exercise. Most people with diabetes are encouraged to get at least 150 minutes each week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity, like walking. Strength training is often recommended at least twice a week. Talk to your doctor about what type of exercise is right for you. Learn how to start (and stick with) a workout routine when you have diabetes. If you aren't active now, start slow. Then build up how much exercise you get over time. Shoot for four to seven periods of activity each week. Try to make each period last at least 30 minutes. And you don't have to work out at the gym to be active. Take the stairs instead of an elevator, or park at the far end of the lot. Both add exercise to your daily routine. Have a realistic goal and make a plan. What exercises will you do, and when will you do them? For example, you might plan to walk 30 minutes most days on your lunch break. Change your activities often enough so you don't get bored. You can do aerobic activities like walking or jogging. And resistance exercises like working out with weights offer another option. Whatever you do, don't forget to stretch before and after each workout session. It's important to realize that exercise lowers your blood sugar. Talk to your doctor about whether you need to adjust your meds or insulin dose to keep your levels high enough. Wear a medical ID tag It is a good idea to wear a MedicAlert bracelet or tag that says you have diabetes. This will make others aware of your condition in case you have a severe hypoglycemic attack and are not able to make yourself understood, or if you are in an accident and need emergency medical care. Identifying yourself as having diabetes is important because hypoglycemic attacks can be mistaken for drunkenness, and victims often aren't able to care for themselves. Without prompt treatment,hypoglycemiacan result in a coma or seizures. And, because your body is under increased stress when you are ill or injured, your blood sugar levels will need to be checked by the medical personnel who give you emergency care. Take care of your teeth Be sure to take good care of your teeth and floss regularly. Diabetes can worsen gum disease. Reduce stress If you're stressed, you may exercise less, drink more, and not watch your diabetes as closely. Stress can also raise your blood sugar and make you less sensitive to insulin. When you're stressed, your body adopts a "fight or flight" response. That means it will make sure you have enough sugar and fat available for energy. Studies of people with type 1 diabetes found blood sugar levels go up for most people under mentalstressand down for others. If you have type 2 diabetes and you're feeling pressure, your glucose will go up. If something has you bothered, try to make changes that can help you relax. You might exercise, spend time with friends, meditate, or replace negative thoughts with positive ones. Do whatever works for you. Support groups,counseling, or therapy can help, too. Quit smoking Kick the habit. It'll give you better control of your blood sugar levels. If you smoke, you're also more likely to have serious health problems as well as a higher chance for complications from diabetes. Those can include: Cut back on alcohol If you're on insulin or oral diabetes meds like sulfonylureas or meglitinides, drinking alcohol can drop blood sugar to dangerous levels. When you drink, your liver has to work to remove the alcohol from your blood instead of regulating your blood sugar. Drunkenness and low blood sugar can also cause dizziness, disorientation, and sleepiness. You could confuse the symptoms of too much alcohol and low blood sugar. A woman should have no more than one drink a day. For men, the limit is two drinks per day. One drink is 12 ounces of beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine, or an ounce and a half of liquor like vodka. With mixed drinks, choose no-calorie mixers like club soda or diet soda. Try switching to a light beer or wine spritzer. You can also sip more slowly or switch to water or another calorie-free drink. If you cut back on the drinks, you may eat better. Alcohol can lower your willpower to resist overeating. Take notes Keeping a detailed daily log can help you track what affects your glucose levels. That log can include: After a week or so, see if you notice any patterns. If you're trying to lose weight, write down everything you eat or drink for a week or two, including portion size. That'll give you a clear picture of where you stand and what changes you can make. If you drink alcohol, check your blood sugar before you drink, while you drink, before you go to bed, and the following day. Alcohol lowers blood sugar for up to 24 hours after you finish your last drink. Vitamins and minerals Alternative medicine should never be used alone to treat diabetes. But there are things you can do -- in addition to medication, proper diet, and exercise -- that may help control your blood sugar and preventcomplications of diabetes. Although chromium does have an effect on insulin as well as on glucose metabolism, there is no evidence that taking chromium supplements can help in the treatment of diabetes. But chromium is found in many healthy foods, such as green vegetables, nuts, and grains. Studies have suggested that biotin, also called vitamin H, when used with chromium, may improve glucose metabolism in people with diabetes. But no studies have shown that biotin by itself is helpful. Vitamins B6 and B12may help treat diabetic nerve pain if you have low levels of these vitamins and that is contributing to the nerve pain. But otherwise, there is no proof that taking these vitamins will help. Vitamin Cmay make up for low blood levels of insulin, which normally works to help cells absorb the vitamin. Proper amounts of vitamin C may help the body maintain a good cholesterol level and keep blood sugar levels under control. But too much can cause kidney stones and other problems. Check with your doctor to see if a vitamin C supplement is right for you. Vitamin Emay help limit damage to the blood vessels and help protect against kidney and eye disease. But too much can lead to serious problems, such as a higher risk of stroke. Talk to your doctor before adding this supplement. Magnesiumhelps control blood sugar levels. Some people with diabetes have a serious magnesium deficiency. Magnesium supplements, in this case, may improve the action of insulin. Mind/body medicine Guided imagery, biofeedback, meditation, hypnotherapy, and yoga reduce stress hormones, which in turn may help stabilize blood sugar levels. Biofeedback may also help lower blood pressure, but more research is needed to discover its role in the treatment of diabetes and high blood pressure. Herbal remedies Capsaicin cream, a topical ointment made with cayenne, has been reported by some patients to help lower pain in the hands and feet from diabetic neuropathy. But people with loss of sensation in the hands or feet should use caution when using capsaicin, as they may not be able to fully feel any burning sensation. Check with your doctor if you are thinking of trying this product. Evening primrose oilis thought to help diabetic nerve pain, but no conclusive evidence has yet been found. Ginkgo, garlic, holy basil leaves, fenugreek seeds, ginseng, and hawthorn are other herbals that have been promoted by some as remedies fordiabetic symptoms. More research is needed to see what, if any, role these herbals may play. Check with your doctor before trying any herbal product.

Diabetes mellitus, also called diabetes, is a term for several conditions involving how your body turns food into energy. The term comes from the Greek word âdiabetes,â which means to siphon or to pass through, and the Latin word âmellitus,â which means sweet. In 2021, 529 million people worldwide and 38.4 million in the U.S. had diabetes.Â When you eat a carbohydrate, your body turns it into a sugar called glucose and sends that to your bloodstream. Your pancreas releases insulin, a hormone that helps move glucose from your blood into your cells, which use it for energy. When you have diabetes and donât get treatment, your body doesnât use insulin like it should. Too much glucose stays in your blood, a condition usually calledhigh blood sugar. This can cause health problems that may be serious or even life-threatening. Thereâs no cure for diabetes. But with treatment and lifestyle changes, you can live a long, healthy life. Diabetes comes in different forms, depending on the cause. Prediabetes is when your blood sugar is higher than it should be but not high enough for your doctor to diagnose it as diabetes. Normal blood sugar levels are between 70 mg/dL and 99 mg/dL. Blood sugar levels in people with prediabetes are between 110 mg/dL and 125 mg/dL. Prediabetes often has no symptoms. More than a third of people in the U.S. have it, but about 90% don't know. If you have prediabetes, you might notice darkened skin on areas like your neck, armpits, and groin. Rarely, you may have other symptoms like: Over 70% of people with prediabetes later developtype 2 diabetes. Youâre also likely to start having heart, kidney, and nerve damage.Â You can lower these risks and potentially reverseprediabetesby:Â Your doctor might recommend medications like acarbose andmetforminif you canât follow these lifestyle changes or youâre at a very high risk of having type 2 diabetes.Â Type 1 diabetes is also called insulin-dependent diabetes. It used to be called juvenile-onset diabetes because it was thought to start more often in childhood. However, more research has shown it happens as frequently in children and adults.Â Type 1 diabetes is an organ-specific autoimmune condition. It happens when your body attacks your pancreas with antibodies. The organ is damaged and doesn't make insulin. It affects 2 million people, including about 304,000 children and teens in the U.S. Your genes might cause this type of diabetes. It could also happen because of problems with cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented.Â Type 1diabetes symptomshappen quickly, in a few days to weeks. They include: About 30% of people with type 1 diabetes have a life-threatening condition that causes loss of consciousness, called diabetic coma, as their first symptom.Â Get medical help immediately if you or your child show any of these symptoms: Many of the health problems that can come with type 1 happen because of damage to tiny blood vessels in your eyes (diabetic retinopathy), nerves (diabetic neuropathy), and kidneys (diabetic nephropathy). People with type 1 also have a higher risk of heart disease and stroke. A doctor may use a test called random plasma glucose (RPG) to check how much sugar you have in your blood when diagnosing type 1 diabetes. They may also use an A1c blood test to estimate your blood sugar levels over the last 3 months. Your doctor uses it to see how well your blood sugar is controlled. That helps them know your risk of complications. Treatment for type 1 diabetes involves injecting insulin into the fatty tissue just under your skin. You might use: If you have type 1 diabetes, youâll need to make changes, including: Type 2 diabetesÂ used to be called non-insulin-dependent or adult-onset diabetes. But itâs become more common in children and teens over the past 20 years, largely because more young people are overweight or obese. About 90% of people with diabetes have type 2. When you have type 2 diabetes, your pancreas usually creates some insulin. But either itâs not enough or your body doesnât use it like it should.ÂInsulin resistance, when your cells donât respond to insulin, usually happens in fat, liver, and muscle cells. Type 2 diabetes is often milder than type 1. But it can still cause major health complications, especially in the tiny blood vessels in your kidneys, nerves, and eyes. Type 2 also raises your risk ofÂ heart diseaseÂ andÂ stroke. People who have obesity -- more than 20% over their target body weight for their height -- have an especially high risk of type 2 diabetes and the health problems that can follow. Obesity often causesÂ insulin resistance, so your pancreas has to work harder to make more insulin. But itâs still not enough to keep your blood sugar levels where they should be. Treatment for type 2 diabetesinvolves keeping a healthy weight, eating right, and exercising. Some people need medication, too. Your doctor might do an A1c test a few times a year to see how well youâve been controlling your blood sugar. Pregnancy usually causes some form of insulin resistance. If this becomes diabetes, itâs called gestational. Doctors often spot it in 2%-10% of pregnancies. You may be diagnosed in the middle or late pregnancy with a:Â It usually causes no or mild symptoms like feeling thirstier or peeing more often. It goes away after giving birth. But people who have had gestational diabetes are 8-10 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes and have twice the risk of developing heart disease compared to those who have not had it.Â Â If youâve had gestational diabetes, youâll need to be tested for type 2 diabetes every 3 years for the rest of your life. If you get gestational diabetes while pregnant, your symptoms should go away once you have your baby. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Gestational diabetesis more of a risk for thebabythan the mother. Because your blood sugars travel through their placenta to the baby, itâs important to control gestational diabetes to protect the baby's growth and development.Â A baby might have unusual weight gain before birth, trouble breathing at birth, or a higher risk of obesity and diabetes later in life. You might need a cesarean section because of an overly large baby, or they might have damage to their heart, kidney, nerves, and eyes. Gestational diabetes treatment involves: Rarely, diabetes can happen due to changes in a single gene that can affect how much insulin the body can produce. When this is the case, it is called monogenic diabetes.Â The gene mutation is often passed down from one or both parents. However, gene mutations may also happen unexpectedly.Â In the U.S., monogenic diabetes happens in 1% to 4% of all diabetes cases.Â The two main types of monogenic diabetes are Many times, doctors mistake monogenic diabetes for type 2 diabetes. But a doctor might suspect monogenic diabetes if:Â Then, they recommend genetic testing to confirm it and determine which specific type you have. They might also test your family members to see if they have it. You may get diabetes medicines you take by mouth or insulin injections to treat it. Secondary diabetes is a type of diabetes that happens because of another primary condition, which may include: Medications like steroids may also trigger secondary diabetes.Â Treatment may involve managing the underlying cause, making lifestyle changes, and taking insulin and other medications to control yourblood sugar levels. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the most common types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes affects 1.3 million people in the U.S., and type 2 diabetes occurs in 37 million people.Â Type 1 diabetes happens when the immune system mistakenly attacks your pancreas, causing it to stop producing insulin. Both genetic and environmental factors play a role in causing this immune response.Â Type 2 diabetes is a hormonal condition that happens when your body doesn't respond well to insulin, which leads to high blood sugar levels. With time, the pancreas in people with type 2 diabetes may stop working as well as it should until it stops being able to produce insulin. Type 1 diabetes symptoms usually happen suddenly within a few days to a week. Type 2 diabetes symptoms take a while, about a year, to develop. People with type 1 diabetes need insulin medicine because the body canât make it anymore. People with type 2 diabetes only need insulin when their pancreas stops making it.Â Diabetes is a group of conditions that affect how well your body turns food into energy. It causes high blood sugar levels that can lead to serious health issues like heart disease, eye damage,dementia, stroke, and kidney damage. Your doctor will manage it depending on the type you have. You may need insulin injections and antidiabetic medicines. Theyâll also recommend following lifestyle changes like eating a healthy diet and exercising.Â Â Is type 2 diabetes manageable? Yes, type 2 diabetes is manageable with medicines and healthy lifestyle changes. What causes diabetes mellitus? What causes diabetes will depend on the type. It may be related to your genes, lifestyle, and family history. But all forms of diabetes cause you to have high blood sugar levels. What are diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2? Types 1 and 2 diabetes are the most common type of diabetes.Type 1 diabeteshappens when your immune system attacks and damages your pancreas, causing it to stop making enough insulin. Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body stops using insulin well.

If it is not controlled,diabetescan cause a host of complications that can affect nearly every organ in the body. Diabetes complications include: Heart disease is one of the most common diabetes complications. In office visits, your doctor may perform various tests to check for heart disease and help you prevent any serious heart-related problems. At every visit, your health care provider will check your blood pressure by placing a cuff around your upper arm that tightens to read the flow of blood through your arteries. They'll also take a small blood sample from your arm to check levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. A baseline EKG should also be obtained as part of a complete medical record. Learn more about personal risk factors you have for heart disease, such as a family history or whether you smoke, and work out a prevention plan that includes weight loss, regular exercise, and stress management, as well as keeping your blood pressure, cholesterol, andtriglyceridesat normal levels. Signs and symptoms of stroke include sudden weakness on one side of the face or body; numbness in the face, arm, or leg; difficulty speaking; trouble seeing with both eyes; or dizziness. If you have any of these symptoms, see a doctor immediately. You may be referred to a neurologist or other stroke specialist. Read more about thewarning signs of strokeand also be aware of ways to prevent this serious problem from happening to you. If you have diabetes, urine testing should be performed yearly to look for diabetic nephropathy -- kidney disease. A baseline creatinineblood test should also be done to determine your kidney function. You may need to be tested more often if you're likely to get kidney disease because of high blood pressure, heart disease, or a family history of kidney failure. Your doctor will check a sample of your urine for albumin, a blood protein that can end up in your pee if your kidneys are damaged. They'll also take a sample of your blood to check yourglomerular filtration rate(GFR), a measure of how well your kidneys are doing their job of filtering waste in your blood. Your health care provider will also check your blood pressure regularly, because control of high blood pressure is essential in slowing kidney disease. Your reading should be less than 130/80. Over time, diabetes can cause nerve damage that produces symptoms of numbness, burning, or pain in your hands, feet, or legs. If your skin becomes numb, you may not notice small wounds that could grow to become bigger health threats. Check your feet and hands daily for redness,calluses, cracks, or skin breakdown. If you notice any of these symptoms before your next scheduled visit, notify your health care provider immediately. To check for these problems, your doctor will thoroughly examine your feet at least once a year. They'll tap on them with a tool similar to a nylon hairbrush bristle or prick your feet with a small needle. If you don't feel it, you may have nerve damage. If you're diagnosed withperipheral diabetic neuropathy, you'll need thorough foot exams at every doctor's visit. To protect your vision, all people with diabetes should see an ophthalmologist (an eye doctor) at least yearly. As part of the eye exam, the doctor will dilate your eyes so that they can see the back of the eye (the retina) and determine if the diabetes is causing damage. For this test, your doctor puts drops into your eyes that temporarily make your pupils get bigger. Then, they use a special magnifying lens to check your retina and optic nerves. They'll also test your eye pressure, side vision, and distance vision. The test is painless. But since you'll be sensitive to light and your vision will remain blurry for a few hours, it's a good idea to bring sunglasses and get someone else to drive you home. In people with type 1 diabetes, these annual exams should start within three to five years of diabetes once the patient is age 10 or older. People with type 2 diabetes should have their first eye exam once they are diagnosed. Those with eye complications may need to see their ophthalmologist more frequently. Women with diabetes who become pregnant should have a comprehensive eye exam during the first trimester and close follow-up with an eye doctor during their pregnancy. (This recommendation does not apply to women who developgestational diabetes.) Diabetes increases your risk ofgastroparesis. With gastroparesis, the nerves to the stomach are damaged and stop working properly. This causes the stomach to take too long to empty its contents and makes it difficult to manage bloodglucose levels. Sometimes, changing your diet can help. There are some medications and treatments for gastroparesis. You may need one or more of these tests: These tests mostly involve eating or drinking something or getting an imaging test (like an X-ray) to help doctors check if your digestive system is working well. Talk to your doctor about ways to prevent diabetes complications. Ask for information on early warning signs so you can seek treatment when it is most effective. Diabetes increases the chance of developingerectile dysfunction, or impotence. For some men, adopting a healthier lifestyle, such as quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and reducing stress, may be all that is needed to resolve erectile dysfunction. It's important to talk to your health care provider about your erectile dysfunction, as your doctor can recommend other remedies -- including medications, a vacuum constriction device (VCD), and other erectile dysfunction aids -- that can help. As many as a third of people with diabetes will have a skin condition related to their disease at some time in their lives. High levels of glucose in the blood provide an excellent breeding ground for bacteria and fungi and can reduce the body's ability to heal itself. Fortunately, most skin conditions can be prevented and successfully treated if caught early. If your skin is not cared for properly with type 2 diabetes, a minor skin condition can turn into a serious problem with potentially severe consequences. Type 2 diabetesslows down your body's ability to fight infection. High blood glucose leads to high levels of sugar in your body's tissues. When this happens, bacteria grow and infections can develop more quickly. Common sites of infection are your bladder, kidneys, vagina, gums, feet, and skin. Early treatment of infections can prevent more serious complications. People with diabetes face a higher than normal risk of serious dental and oral health problems. The more uncontrolled the blood sugar, the more likely dental and oral health problems will arise. This is because uncontrolled diabetes impairs white blood cells, which are the body's main defense against infections that can occur in the mouth. Over time, untreated plaque can lead to tooth decay,gum disease(gingivitis), periodontitis, and tooth loss. So keep an eye out for signs of gum problems, including swollen, tender, or bleeding gums. Whether you have diabetes or not, be sure to brush, floss, and rinse with antiseptic mouthwash daily. See your dentist for regular cleanings and checkups to prevent serious dental problems. Most diabetes complications are linked to blood sugar levels that are too high or too low. AnA1c blood testis a key way to check that your blood sugar levels aren't out of whack. Until your blood sugar levels are stable, your doctor may do an A1c test four times a year. From then on, you'll get tested twice a year. Your doctor will take a sample of blood from your arm or finger to measure your average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months. If you take insulin or have blood sugar levels that are out of control, your doctor may also recommend that you test yourself at home as often as several times every day. You'll prick your finger and place a drop of blood on a disposable test strip that feeds into a portable bloodglucose meter. Your doctor may also prescribe aÂ continuing glucose monitor in which a sensor is inserted under your skin and continually monitors your glucose levels. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) test When your cells don't get enough glucose, they start to burn fat for energy, which makes things called ketones. High ketone levels signal that your diabetes is out of control or that you're getting sick. This can lead todiabetic ketoacidosis(DKA), a dangerous complication. Your doctor may suggest you take a sample of your urine at home and check ketone levels with a special test strip if: Thyroid tests Diabetes is linked to a condition called hypothyroidism. This is when your thyroid gland doesn't make enough of the hormones that control your metabolism. The American Diabetes Association recommends universal screening forÂ thyroid in type 1 diabetes. You may get tested every 1 to 2 years if you have a higher chance of gettinghypothyroidismbecause you're a woman over 40 or you have a family history of thyroid disease.

Type 1 diabetes is a condition in which your immune system destroys insulin-making cells (beta cells) in your pancreas. That means your body can't make enough insulin or any at all. Insulin is a hormone that helps move glucose (sugar) from your blood and into your cells so it can be used for energy. Because type 1 diabetes is often diagnosed in kids and young adults, it used to be called juvenile diabetes. In the past, it was also called insulin-dependent diabetes. Are you born with type 1 diabetes? You can get it at any age. In fact, half of all people now diagnosed with type 1 diabetes are adults. Type 1 diabetes vs. secondary diabetes A condition called secondary diabetes is like type 1, but your insulin-making cells are wiped out by another health condition or an injury to your pancreas, rather than by your immune system. Type 1 diabetes vs. type 2diabetes If you have type 1, your body doesn't make enough insulin. Withtype 2 diabetes, your body can make insulin but can't use it well. The cells in your muscles, fat, and liver build up what's called insulin resistance. With type 1 diabetes, you need to use man-made insulin every day so your body can function. But not everyone with type 2 diabetes needs it. Other medications can help you manage the condition. No matter which type of diabetes you have, you'll need to keep a close eye on your daily habits, such as what you eat and how much activity you get to stay healthy. Keeping a close eye on your blood sugar is a key part of managing diabetes. A continuous glucose monitor lets you check your levels in real time. (Photo Credit: Moment/Getty Images) Symptoms can come on very quickly. They include: Late-onset type 1diabetes symptoms More research is being done on what's calledLatent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults(LADA). Some people refer to this as "Diabetes 1.5" or "Diabetes 1 1/2" because it overlaps with parts of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. LADA symptomscan come on very slowly, making it tricky to diagnose. So does the fact that people who have it are usually at a healthy weight, and often between the ages of 30 and 50 years. Your child is at higher risk of type 1 diabetes if: Type 1 diabetes symptoms in children The signs are the same as for adults, but you may also notice: In some babies or kids, type 1 diabetes can also look like the flu. If you notice any of these symptoms, take your child to the doctor. Experts aren't sure what causes your pancreas to stop making insulin for your body. Your genes and immune system both appear to play big roles. Is type 1 diabetes genetic? To an extent, yes. Once you inherit genes that put you at risk for type 1, an environmental trigger such as an infection, virus, orautoimmune disorder, seems necessary to "switch" them on. When scientists look atthe blood of people with type 1, they can see special proteins that show their immune system is going after their pancreas. Only about 5%-10% of people with diabetes have type 1. The risk factors for it aren't as clear as they are for type 2 diabetes.Â So far, experts only know that youâre more likely to have it if you: If your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, theyâll check your blood sugar levels. This can be done in a few different ways. A1c test.Also called a glycated hemoglobin test, it can figure out your average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months with one small blood sample. It does that by counting the number of hemoglobin (red blood) cells that are sticky with glucose.Â If your A1c result is 6.5% or higher, you'll retake the test. If it's the same number or higher, you likely have diabetes. This test may not give you a correct result if you have any of the following: If you're of African, Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian descent, you could also have a different type of hemoglobin (called a hemoglobin variant) that could skew your A1c result. Let your doctor know if any of these apply to you. If so, they can test your blood sugar in different ways, such asÂ Fasting blood sugar test.In this test, your blood's taken after you haven't eaten overnight. A result of 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or higher on two separate tests signals diabetes. Random blood sugar test.Your blood glucose can also be checked at a random time. Whether or not you've recently eaten, a result of 200 mg/dL or higher means diabetes. Type 1 diabetes test The above tests can show whether you have diabetes, but they can't tell you which type. To find out whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, your doctor will need to look for: Autoantibodies.These are the proteins in your immune system that attack healthy cells, such as beta cells in your pancreas that make insulin. If you have type 1 diabetes, they'll show up in a blood sample. Ketones. When you have type 1, your body relies on acids called ketones for fuel because it doesn't have enough glucose to use. A urine (pee) test can detect them. Across the U.S., type 1 diabetes is on the rise. Hispanic and Black communities are affected more than others. For instance, studies show that if you have brown or black skin, controlling your blood glucose once you're diagnosed is more of a challenge. Black children with type 1 diabetes are also at higher risk ofdepression, diabetes complications, and hospital stays. Structural racism plays a big part in explaining this inequality. Many long-standing laws and policies discriminate against people of color. So do systems such as health care. You can be diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and live a long, healthy life. Keeping a close eye on your blood sugar levels will be key. Your doctor will give you a target range, and making healthy choices daily will help you stay within that range. It's also important to know the symptoms of very high or low blood sugar, and how to treat them. Type 1 diabetes medications You'll also need to use insulin every day. When your doctor talks about insulin, theyâll mention three main things: Several types of insulin are available. Ways to take insulin Insulin doesn't come in pill form, so you'll have to rely on other ways to get it into your body: Insulin injections.Most insulin shots come in a small glass bottle called a vial. You draw it out with a syringe that has a needle on the end and give yourself the shot. Some kinds come in a prefilled pen. Inhaled insulin.Your doctor may prescribe a rapid-acting insulin that you breathe into your mouth through a small device. It's not healthy to use this type if you smoke or have lung issues such as asthma. Insulin pump.This device, which you wear, sends small bursts of insulin into your body throughout the day. It does this through a small tube just under your skin. Your doctor will help you pick the type of insulin and delivery method thatâs best for you. Continuous glucose monitoring Checking your blood sugar throughout the day will help make sure it stays within your target range. Pricking your finger and testing a blood sample with a blood glucose meter is one way to check. Many people also choose to wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). Using a sensor just under your skin, this device can check your glucose every few minutes. Most models will alert you if it goes too high or too low, so you can treat it right away. Other type 1 diabetes medications Based on your health, your doctor could also prescribe: To feel your best, try to: Get enough sleep. It can improve your blood sugar as well as your outlook. If you can, aim for at least 7 hours each night. Babies, kids, and teens will need even more. Manage your stress. It's really common to feel angry or overwhelmed that you have type 1. Find healthy ways to reduce your stress. Talk to trusted friends and family members or ask your doctor to refer you to a counselor or therapist. Quit smoking.Vaping and chewing tobacco are habits to stop, too. All these things narrow yourblood vesselsand put you at risk for other health issues. Talk to your doctor if you're not sure how to quit. Visit your doctor regularly. Regular medical, dental, and eye exams can help you prevent issues, or treat them as soon as they're found. Find ways to be active.Try to find a physical activity you enjoy. Even taking care of your garden counts. Talk to your doctor about how to balance your insulin dose and the food you eat with any activity you do. Type 1 diabetes diet Once you know how carbs, fats, and protein affect your blood sugar, you can build a healthy eating plan that helps keep your levels where they should be. Generally speaking, you'll focus on eating lots of nutrient-rich vegetables, fruits, and whole grains while cutting back on refined carbohydrates, such as white bread or pasta, which quickly raise your blood sugar. No foods is off-limits, but you will need to limit some or enjoy smaller portions than you used to. A diabetes educator or registered dietitian can help you learn to count carbohydrates at each meal and snack. If you're not sure how to connect with these experts, ask your doctor. If your blood sugar isn't well-managed, it can lead to other health issues, including: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).If your body can't get enough glucose for fuel, it breaks down fat cells instead. This creates chemicals called ketones. Your liver releases the sugar it stores to help out. But your body canât use it without insulin, so it builds up in your blood, along with the acidic ketones. This mix of extra glucose, dehydration, and acid buildup is known as ketoacidosis and can be life-threatening if not treated right away. Heart disease.Diabetes can put you at higher risk ofblood clots, high blood pressure, and cholesterol. These can lead to chest pain, heart attack, stroke, or heart failure. Skin conditions.You're more likely to get blisters and rashes, as well as bacterial or fungal infections. Gum disease.A dry mouth, increased plaque, and poor blood flow can all cause mouth issues. Pregnancy complications.Type 1 diabetes raises your risk of early delivery, birth defects, stillbirth, andpreeclampsia. Retinopathy.This eye issue happens in about 80% of adults who have had type 1 diabetes for more than 15 years. To prevent it and to keep your eyesight,you'll need to control your blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Kidney damage.About 20%-30% of people with type 1 diabetes get a condition called nephropathy. The chance of getting it goes up over time. Itâs most likely to show up 15-25 years after the onset of diabetes. It can lead to other serious problems such as kidney failure and heart disease. Poor blood flow and nerve damage.Damaged nerves and hardened arteries lead to a loss of feeling in, and a lack of blood supply to, your feet. This raises your chances of injury and makes it harder for open sores and wounds to heal. When that happens, you could lose a limb. Nerve damage can also cause digestive problems such as nausea, vomiting, anddiarrhea. Exciting new treatments in the works include: Glucose monitoring without needle sticks.This is proving to be a challenge for scientists. Continuous ketone monitor (CKM). Like a CGM, a wearable device would monitor the fluid between your cells. Longer-acting insulin. For instance, one type would keep your blood glucose steady for a week. Immunotherapy.Some experts are looking for ways to "switch off" your immune system so it stops attacking the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. "New" beta cells.One early-stage Australian study was able to get pancreatic stem cells to make insulin. If testing pans out, your remaining pancreas cells may be treated one day to start makinginsulinagain.

Type 2 diabetes is a lifelong disease that keeps your body from using insulin the way it should. People who are middle-aged or older are most likely to get this kind of diabetes. It used to be called adult-onset diabetes or diabetes mellitus. But type 2 diabetes also affects kids andteens, mainly because ofchildhood obesity. Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes. About 1 in 10 people in the U.S. have type 2. Nearly 1 in 3 have prediabetes, meaning their blood sugar (or blood glucose) is high but not high enough to be diabetes yet. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes can be so mild that you don't notice them. About 9 million people have it and don't know it. Symptoms include: If you have dark rashes around your neck or armpits, see your doctor. These are called acanthosis nigricans, and they can be signs that your body is becoming resistant to insulin. Learn more about type 2 diabetes symptoms. There are three main types of diabetes: Type 2 diabetes About 90%-95% of all people with diabetes have this type. With type 2, your pancreas makes someinsulinâ the hormone that helps your cells turn glucose (a type of sugar) from the food you eat into energy. In some people, your cells don't respond to this hormone as they should (a condition called insulin resistance). Type 1 diabetes In type 1, your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin, leading to high blood sugar. Doctors aren't sure why this happens. Type 1 isn't related to weight or lifestyle habits. It used to be called insulin-dependent or childhood diabetes.Â Gestational diabetes You only get this type of diabetes when you're pregnant. It happens because hormonal changes andweight gainduring pregnancy can lead toinsulin resistance. It usually goes away after you have your baby. Usually, a combination of things causes type 2 diabetes. They might include: Genes.Scientists have found different bits of DNA that affect how your body makes insulin. Weight.Having extra weight or obesity can cause insulin resistance. Metabolic syndrome.People with insulin resistance often have a group of conditions including high blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol and triglycerides. Too much glucose from your liver.When your blood sugar is low, your liver makes and sends out glucose. After you eat, your blood sugar goes up, and your liver usually slows down and stores its glucose for later. But some people's livers don't. They keep making sugar. Bad communication between cells.Sometimes, cells send the wrong signals or don't pick up messages correctly. When these problems affect how your cells make and use insulin or glucose, this can lead to diabetes. Broken beta cells.If the cells that make insulin send it out at the wrong time, your blood sugar gets thrown off.High blood sugarcan damage these cells, too. Certain things make it more likely that youâll get type 2 diabetes. The more of these factors apply to you, the higher your chances of getting it. It's good to be aware of what can cause type 2 diabetes, such as: Risk factors related to your medical history and health include: Other things that raise yourrisk of diabetesare related to your daily habits and lifestyle. These are the ones you can change: Type 2 diabetes epidemiology Some 462 million people worldwide, or about 6.3% of the population, have type 2 diabetes. It's the ninth leading cause of death, responsible for more than 1 million deaths each year. Cases of type 2 diabetes are increasing faster in developed countries such as the U.S. and Western Europe. Scientists say type 2 diabetes affects men and women at about the same rate. It's more common in people in middle age and older, affecting: It's also more common in people of color, including those whose heritage is: Your doctor can test your blood for signs of type 2 diabetes. Usually, theyâll test you on 2 different days to confirm the diagnosis. But if yourblood glucoseis very high or you have many symptoms, one test may be all you need. Blood tests for type 2 diabetes include: A1c.It's an average percentage of your blood glucose over the past 2 or 3 months. Fasting plasma glucose.This is also known as a fasting blood sugar test. It measures your blood sugar on an empty stomach. You won't be able to eat or drink anything except water for 8 hours before the test. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).This checks your blood glucose before and 2 hours after you drink something sweet to see how your body handles the sugar. Learn more about how type 2 diabetes is diagnosed.Â Researchers have defined four stages of type 2 diabetes: Insulin resistance In this stage, your body usually makes enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels in the normal range. But if your cells "resist" the insulin (don't use it correctly), your body will make more insulin to help the glucose get into them. Insulin resistance can be temporary, but it can also last. There's no test to detect insulin resistance, so it can be hard to diagnose. Prediabetes Eventually, insulin resistance causes glucose to build up in your blood. You have prediabetes when your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered diabetes. An A1c between 5.7% and 6.4% means you haveprediabetes. You may not have any symptoms, but prediabetes ups your risk for heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.Â Type 2 diabetes If your A1c is 6.5% or higher, you have diabetes. You may have symptoms such as increased thirst, blurred vision, and numbness in feet or hands. Or you may not have any symptoms at all.Â Type 2 diabetes with vascular complications At this stage, your diabetes has led to vascular (blood vessel) problems. You may have damage to vessels in your eyes (retinopathy), kidneys (nephropathy), and certain nerves (neuropathy). You might also develop heart disease, stroke, or circulation issues. Managing type 2 diabetes includes a mix of lifestyle changes and medication. Lifestyle changes You may be able to reach your target blood sugar levels with diet and exercise alone. Weight loss.Dropping extra pounds can help. While losing 5% of your body weight is good, losing at least 7% and keeping it off seems to be ideal. That means someone who weighs 180 pounds can change their blood sugar levels by losing around 13 pounds. Weight loss can seem overwhelming, but portion control and eating healthy foods are a good place to start. Healthy eating.Thereâs no specific diet for type 2 diabetes. A registered dietitian can teach you about carbs and help you make a meal plan you can stick with. Focus on: Exercise.Try to get 30-60 minutes of physical activity every day. You can walk, bike, swim, or do anything else that ups your heart rate. Pair that with strength training, such as yoga or weightlifting. If you take a medication that lowers your blood sugar, you might need a snack before a workout. Watch your blood sugar levels.Depending on your treatment, especially if youâre on insulin, your doctor will tell you if you need to test your blood sugar levels and how often to do it. Type 2 diabetes medication If lifestyle changes donât get you to your target blood sugar levels, you may need medication. Some of the most common for type 2 diabetes include: Metformin(Fortamet, Glucophage, Glumetza, Riomet). This is usually the first medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. It lowers the amount of glucose your liver makes and helps your body respond better to the insulin it does make. Sulfonylureas.This group of drugs helps your body make more insulin. They include glimepiride (Amaryl), glipizide (Glucotrol), and glyburide (DiaBeta, Micronase). Meglitinides.They help your body make more insulin and work faster than sulfonylureas. You might take nateglinide (Starlix) or repaglinide (Prandin). Thiazolidinediones.Like metformin, they make you more sensitive to insulin. You could get pioglitazone (Actos) or rosiglitazone (Avandia). But they also raise your risk of heart problems, so they arenât usually a first choice for treatment. DPP-4 inhibitors.These medications â linagliptin (Tradjenta), saxagliptin (Onglyza), and sitagliptin (Januvia) â help lower your blood sugar levels, but they can also cause joint pain and could inflame your pancreas. They work by blocking DPP-4, which is an enzyme that affects the hormone incretin. GLP-1 receptor agonists.You take these medications through a needle to slow digestion and lower blood sugar levels. Some of the most common ones are exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon), liraglutide (Victoza), and semaglutide (Ozempic). Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.These medications miglitol (Glyset) and acarbose (Precose) slow your body's digestion of sugar. Let your doctor know if you have kidney, liver, or heart issues or if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. These medicines are unlikely to cause low blood pressure and weight gain; however, side effects include gastrointestinal issues and abnormal liver readings. Biguanides.This medication, metformin (Fortamet, Glucophage, Glumetza, and Riomet), lowers blood sugar levels. Typical side effects include gastrointestinal issues, nausea or vomiting, weakness, and headache. You should avoid drinking large amounts of alcohol when taking this drug because it may trigger a rare side effect, a buildup of acid in your blood called lactic acidosis. SGLT2 inhibitors.These help your kidneys filter out more glucose. You might getbexagliflozin (Brenzavvy),canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), or empagliflozin (Jardiance). Empagliflozin has also proven effective in reducingÂ the risk of hospitalization or death from heart failure. GIP and GLP-1Â receptor agonist.Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) is the first in this class andÂ activates both the GLP-1 and GIP receptors, which leads to improved blood sugar control. Insulin.You might take long-lasting shots at night, such as insulin detemir (Levemir) or insulin glargine (Lantus). Even if you change your lifestyle and take your medicine as directed, your blood sugar may still get worse over time. That doesnât mean youâve done something wrong. Diabetes is progressive, and many people eventually need more than one drug. When you take more than one drug to control your type 2 diabetes, thatâs called combination therapy. You and your doctor should work together to find the best mix for you.Â Some drugs control blood sugar spikes (also called hyperglycemia) that come right after meals, for instance. Others are more effective at stopping drops in blood sugar (hypoglycemia) between meals. Some may help with weight loss or cholesterol, as well as your diabetes. You and your doctor should talk about any possible side effects. Cost may be an issue as well. If you take medication for something else, that will need to be factored into any decision. Youâll need to see your doctor more often when you start taking a new combination of drugs. You might find that adding a second drug doesnât bring your blood sugar under control. Or the combination of two drugs might work only for a short time. If that happens, your doctor might consider a third non-insulin drug, or you may start insulin therapy. SurgeriesÂ for type 2 diabetes Weight loss surgery can effectively treat type 2 diabetes by helping youlose weight. These procedures limit how much food you can eat or how many nutrients your body can take in. You'll need to commit to long-term healthy lifestyle changes to get the full benefits of this type of surgery.Â Several types are available. Talk to your doctor about whether weight loss surgery is right for you. Alternative treatments for type 2 diabetes There's not much scientific evidence that any alternative treatment can help you manage your blood sugar. Research into dietary supplements has found that: Some research has found that mind-body practices such as yoga and meditation might help with blood sugar control when used along withdiabetes drugs.That may be because of their stress-relief benefits. Always talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatment. These treatments can't replace diabetes medications. Some populations are more likely to get type 2 diabetes. Latino (12%), Black (12%), and Asian (10%) people have higher rates of diabetes than white people (7%). American Indians get it at about twice the rate as white people (14.5%). Members of racial and ethnic minority groups with type 2 are also likely to have worse health outcomes. Yet research shows that members of minority groups are less likely to use newer diabetes medications, regardless of their income or whether they havehealth insurance. And no matter what their ethnicity, people with lower incomes were less likely to take these medications. Across all races and ethnicities with diabetes, about 15% live in poverty, 19% have difficulties accessing food, and 51% have low-quality diets. Also, Black, Latino, and Native American people are less likely to be included in clinical studies to try new diabetes drugs. Over time, high blood sugar can damage and cause problems with your: Heart and blood vessels.If you have high blood sugar, youâre up to twice as likely to get heart disease or have a stroke, and at a younger age compared to those with normal sugar. Youâre also at high risk of blocked blood vessels (atherosclerosis) and chest pain (angina). Kidneys.If your kidneys are damaged or you have kidney failure, you could need dialysis or a kidney replacement. Eyes.High blood sugar can damage the tiny blood vessels in the backs of your eyes. If left untreated, it can cause blindness. Nerves.This can lead to trouble with digestion, loss of sensation in your feet, and sexual problems. Skin.Your blood doesnât circulate as well, so wounds heal slower and can become infected. Pregnancy.Parents with diabetes are more likely to have a miscarriage, a stillbirth, or a baby with a birth defect. Sleep.You might develop sleep apnea, a condition in which your breathing stops and starts while you sleep. Hearing.Youâre more likely to have hearing problems, but itâs not clear why. Brain.High blood sugar can damage your brain and might put you at a higher risk of Alzheimerâs disease. Depression.People with the disease are twice as likely to get depressed as people who donât have it. The best way to avoid these complications is to manage your type 2 diabetes well. To do that: Managing diabetes is complicated. You'll need to adopt healthy lifestyle habits, check your blood sugar regularly, and keep up with doctor visits and treatments. But your efforts can have a big impact on your health and your quality of life. Type 2 diabetes diet Adietitiancan help you create a personalized meal plan that takes your needs and preferences into account. A healthy diabetes diet should focus on: Type 2 diabetes costs On average,people diagnosed with diabetes have medical expenses that are 2.6 times higher than those without the disease. Your annual medical expenses can average$19,736 a year,$12,022 of which is directly due to diabetes.Â These expenses include doctor visits, hospitalizations, and medication. You may have other costs as well, such as lost time and less productivity at work. Managing type 2 diabetes Managing your type 2 diabetes well helps you avoid complications and feel your best. Along with a healthy diet, regular exercise, and medication as prescribed: Type 2 diabetes and mental health A long-term health condition can take a toll on your mental health. Peoplewith diabetes are two to three times as likely to havedepressionand 20% more likely to have anxiety than those without the condition. Many don't get diagnosed or treated, even though therapy, medication, or a combination can work very well. Many people with diabetes sometimes get overwhelmed by the pressures of trying to manage the condition. This is called diabetes distress, and it can lead to you to neglect your health. A support group or counseling could help you overcome it. If you're worried about your emotional health, ask your doctor to recommend a mental health professional. The long-term outlook for people with type 2 varies depending on how effectively they manage the condition. At age 50, the average life expectancy (LE) for those with type 2 is 6 years shorter than those without the condition. But proper care and treatment can help you improve those odds.Â Can type 2 diabetes be cured? There's no cure for type 2. You may be able to get your blood sugar under control by losing weight and making healthy lifestyle changes and might even be able to stop taking diabetes medications. But this isn't the case for everyone.Â What to expect with type 2 diabetes Type 2 is a serious condition that demands lifelong management. Over the long term, high blood sugar can lead to heart, vision, and kidney problems. But you can take steps to avoid these complications and extend your life. Several studies show that: All these things also reduce your risk of developing other diseases. Adopting a healthy lifestyle can help you lower your risk of diabetes: Type 2 diabetes is a serious condition that requires lifelong management. Weight loss, a healthy lifestyle, and medications, if needed, can help you keep it under control. All can help you live a longer, healthier life. Can you reverse type 2 diabetes? Type 2 diabetes is not curable, but the glucose levels of some people can return to normal or prediabetes levels in what is called complete and partial remission. People are able to accomplish this mainly by losing weight. Sometimes, the beta cells, which make insulin, stop working, in a condition known as glucose toxicity. You might also go into remission when your glucose levels decrease and your beta cells start to produce insulin again. What lifestyle changes can help prevent or manage type 2 diabetes? If you have an increased risk for diabetes, making lifestyle changes can help prevent the disease. Some things you can do: Is type 2 diabetes an autoimmune disease? There is a type of diabetes that develops in adulthood called latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). In people with LADA, the pancreas stops making insulin, similar to type 1 diabetes but at a slower rate. In LADA, an autoimmune response damages pancreatic cells and causes them to stop working.Â What role does diet play in the management of type 2 diabetes? Diet plays a tremendous role in managing your diabetes. A healthy diet can help manage your blood sugar levels as well as lower cholesterol levels and blood pressure. It's important to know what carbohydrates may be "good" or "bad" for your diabetes. You should greatly reduce unhealthy refined carbohydrates and foods high in added sugar, salt, and fats. A diet rich in whole grains, fiber, vegetables, lean proteins, legumes, and some fruits is a healthy one if you have diabetes. How does exercise impact type 2 diabetes management? As with a healthy diet, exercise is important in managing your diabetes. Exercise is key in losing and managing weight and lowering cholesterol and blood pressure. Studies have found that exercise can lower A1c levels by nearly 1%, even in people who lost no weight, regardless of the type of exercise. Other findings: walking at least 2 hours weekly lowered the risk of death from heart disease, particularly in women. Also, combining aerobic exercise and resistance training helps lower insulin resistance in adults who previously didn't exercise at all.

Gestational diabetesÂ is a condition in which yourÂblood sugar levelsÂ become high duringÂ pregnancy. It affects pregnant people who have never been diagnosed withÂ diabetes. There are two classes of gestational diabetes. Those with class A1 can manage it throughÂ diet and exercise. Those who have class A2 need to takeÂ insulinÂ or otherÂ medications. Gestational diabetes goes away after you give birth. But it can affect yourÂ babyâs health, and it raises your odds of gettingÂtype 2 diabetesÂ later in life. You can take steps so you and your baby stay healthy. How common is gestational diabetes? Gestational diabetes affects up to 10% of pregnancies in the U.S. each year. If you have gestational diabetes, you usually donât have symptoms or might blame them onpregnancy. Most find out that they have it during a routine screening.You may notice that: The American Diabetes Association recommends these targets for pregnant women who test their blood sugar: When you eat, yourÂ pancreasÂ releases insulin, a hormone that helps move a sugar called glucose from your blood to your cells, which use it for energy. During pregnancy, yourÂ placentaÂ makes hormones that cause glucose to build up in yourÂ blood. Usually, yourÂ pancreasÂ can send out enough insulin to handle it. But if your body canât make enough insulin or stops using insulin as it should, yourblood sugar levelsrise, and you get gestational diabetes. Youâre more likely to get gestational diabetes if you: Gestational diabetes usually happens in the second half of pregnancy. When do they test for gestational diabetes? Your doctor will check for it between weeks 24 and 28, or sooner if you're at high risk. Gestational diabetes test Your doctor will give you aglucose tolerance test. For the test, youâll drink 50 grams of glucose in a sweet drink, which will raise yourÂ blood sugar. An hour later, youâll take a blood glucose test to see how your body handled all that sugar. If the results show that your blood sugar is higher than a certain level, youâll need a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test. For this test, youâll take a blood glucose test after you have fasted for at least 8 hours (your doctorâs office will tell you exactly how long to fast for) and then drink a beverage containing 100 grams of glucose. After that, youâll take a blood glucose test every hour for the next 3 hours. Your doctor can also test you by having you fast for at least 8 hours, take a blood glucose test, drink a drink containing 75 grams of glucose, and then take ablood glucose testonce an hour for the next 2 hours. Gestational diabetes range A high blood sugar level is above 130-140 mg/dL (7.2-7.7 mmol/L). If it's higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), then it's likely that you have gestational diabetes. If youâre at high risk but your test results are normal, your doctor might test you again later in your pregnancy to make sure you still donât have it. If you have gestational diabetes, youâll need treatment as soon as possible to keep yourself and your baby healthy during your pregnancy and delivery. Your doctor will ask you to: Your doctor will keep track of yourÂ weightÂ and your babyâs development. They might give you insulin or another medicine to keep your blood sugar under control. If you have gestational diabetes, you have a higher chance of complications. They include: Needing a C-section.Since your baby might be larger than normal, you may need a C-section, or surgery to deliver your baby through your belly. Hypoglycemia.Also called low blood sugar, this condition can happen when you take insulin or other medicine to control your diabetes. Both you and your baby can gethypoglycemia. Preeclampsia.If you have high blood pressure, protein in your pee, and constant swelling in your fingers and toes, it could indicate preeclampsia. It's a serious condition requiring close tracking by a doctor. Preeclampsia can be dangerous for both you and your unborn child. It can lead to your baby being born early and raise your chances of seizures or stroke during labor. If you have diabetes, you're more prone to high blood pressure than those without diabetes. Take these simple steps to stay well: Eat a healthy, low-sugar diet.Â Talk to your doctor to be sure youâre getting the nutrition you need. Follow a meal plan made for someone withdiabetes: Gestational diabetes breakfast ideas Here are a few breakfast ideas if you have gestational diabetes: Gestational diabetes snacks For a snack, you can try: Get the right prenatal care:Your doctor can check to see if you havegestational diabetesand offer advice on food, activity, and weight loss. They can also point you to other health professionals, such asnutritionists, that can help.If you haveÂ morning sickness, eat small snacks.Â Nibble on crackers,Â cereal, or pretzels before you get out of bed. As you go through your day, have small meals often and avoid fatty, fried, and greasy foods. If you take insulin, make sure you've got a plan to deal withÂ low blood sugar.Â Throwing up can lower your glucose level. Talk to your doctor if you're not sure what to do. Exercise throughout your pregnancy.Â You can exercise when you have gestational diabetes as long as your doctor says itâs OK. Being active is a good way to help manage your blood sugar. Staying fit during pregnancy is also good for your posture and can curb some common problems, such as backaches andÂ fatigue. You can lower your chancesÂ before you get pregnantÂ by: Your baby will probably be healthy if you and your doctor manage yourblood sugarwhile you have gestational diabetes. Right after you give birth, doctors will check your newborn's blood sugar level. If itâs low, your baby may need to get glucose through an IV until it gets back to normal. Gestational diabetes raises the chance that your baby will be larger than normal. It's also linked toÂ jaundice, in which theÂ skinÂ looks yellowish.Jaundicegenerally fades quickly with treatment. Although your child will be more likely than other kids to getÂ type 2 diabetesÂ later on, a healthy lifestyle (including a good diet and lots of physical activity) can cut that risk. Average week of delivery with gestational diabetes Having gestational diabetes means your doctor may induce labor early, at 37-38 weeks. A full-term pregnancy starts at 39 weeks. An earlier labor lowers the chances of health problems for you and your baby. Because you had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of havingÂtype 2 diabetes. But it's not certain that it will happen, and you can take action to prevent that. Your blood sugar levels will likely return to normal about 6 weeks afterÂ childbirth. (Your doctor will check on that.) If it does, you should get follow-up tests at least every 3 years; your doctor may recommend yearly testing. To lower your odds: If you plan to have another baby, keep in mind that you are more likely to get gestational diabetes again. Ask your doctor if any lifestyle changes would help you avoid that. Gestational diabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels rise during pregnancy. It affects up to 10% of pregnancies in the U.S. It typically appears in the second half of pregnancy and often goes unnoticed, with symptoms such as more thirst, hunger, and peeing. You have a higher chance of getting it if you're overweight before pregnancy, have a family history of diabetes, and belong to certain ethnic backgrounds. Treatment focuses on tracking your blood sugar levels, adopting a healthy diet, and staying active. Although gestational diabetes usually goes away after childbirth, it can impact your baby's health and raise your chances of having type 2 diabetes later in life.

Prediabetes,Â or borderline diabetes, is when yourÂ blood sugarÂ level is higher than it should be but not high enough for your doctor to diagnose diabetes.Â People with type 2 diabetes almost always have prediabetes first. But it doesnât usually cause symptoms. About 98 million people in the U.S. have prediabetes, but more than 80% donât know that they have it. Prediabetes treatment can prevent more serious health problems, includingÂtype 2 diabetesÂ and problems with yourÂ heart, blood vessels,Â eyes, andÂ kidneys. Your doctor might also call this condition: Most people don't have any signs of prediabetes. But you might notice that: Prediabetes symptoms in women Some early diabetes symptoms that could affect women (and those assigned female at birth) in particular are: You get prediabetes because you have insulin resistance. That's when your body makesinsulin(a hormone that helps regulate the levels of sugar in your bloodstream) but doesn't use it correctly. This causes your blood sugar levels to be higher than they should be. Insulin resistance causes Doctors aren't sure exactly why people develop insulin resistance. But things that can contribute to it include: Â Prediabetes risk factors Youâre more likely to get prediabetes if you: Get tested for prediabetes if those things apply to you and if you: Why race and ethnicity matter in prediabetes As with diabetes, prediabetes is more common in people of certain ethnic and racial groups. Native Americans and Alaska Natives have the highest rates of diabetes among populations in the U.S. An estimated 75,000 people in the Navajo Area alone are thought to have prediabetes. According to the CDC, prediabetes affects about: There are many reasons for the disparities, including family health history and differences in access to health care, healthy foods, and safe places to exercise. Prediabetes and gender The CDC says prediabetes affects men at a slightly higher rate (41%) than women (32%). Some early studies indicated that gender-affirminghormone therapymight worsen insulin resistance and increase the risk of diabetes in transgender women. But follow-up studies showed conflicting results, so more research is needed into this. Â Â Â Your doctor will do at least one of these tests: Fasting plasma glucose test You wonât eat for 8 hours, and then a technician will take your blood to test the sugar levels. The results indicate: Oral glucose tolerance test First, you'll have a fasting plasma glucose test. Then, you'll drink something sugary. After 2 hours, a technician will take more blood for testing. The results indicate: Hemoglobin A1c test This blood test shows your average blood sugar levels for the past 2-3 months. Doctors give it to people who have diabetes to see if their blood sugar levels are under control. They can also use it to diagnose prediabetes or diabetes. The results indicate: You may need to take the test again to confirm the results. Doctors diagnose prediabetes based on the same blood sugar levels, no matter the personâs age. The American Diabetes Association says children aged 10 and older should be tested if they have extra weight or obesity along with: If a child who has a high chance of getting prediabetes gets normal test results, the American Diabetes Association advises testing them again at least every 3 years. Without treatment, prediabetes can become type 2 diabetes. That can lead to other serious problems, including: Even before it becomes diabetes, untreated prediabetes could causelong-term damage to your blood vessels,kidneysand heart. It's been linked to so-called silent heart attacks, whose symptoms are so minor that you may not even notice them. The main treatment for prediabetes is a healthy lifestyle that includes these steps: If you're at high risk of diabetes, your doctor might also suggest you takeÂ medicationÂ suchÂ as metforminÂ (Glucophage) to lower your blood sugar. Prediabetes diet Thereâs no official diet, but these five swaps can help reverse prediabetes and lower your chances of gettingÂ type 2 diabetes: If making big diet changes seems tough, start with little changes such as: SomeÂ healthy eating plans that can lower your chances of diabetes include: If youâre not sure how to plan your meals, ask your doctor. They can refer you to a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). Thatâs a professional whoâs trained to help you find healthy ways to eat. Most importantly, theyâll want to come up with a plan you can stick to. Exercise for prediabetes When youÂ exercise, your body uses theÂ sugar in yourÂ blood to fuel yourÂ workout. Over time, regular physical activity can lower your overall glucose levels. Youâll also become more sensitive to the insulin in your body. That makes it easier for your muscles to tap into that glucose. You should get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise. Aim for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. You donât have to do anything too intense. You can: You may want to add a couple of days of strength, or resistance, training. Thatâs when you use weight machines, free weights, your own body, or exercise bands to build muscle. If youâre new to exercise, talk to your doctor about whatâs safe for you. Prediabetes and weight loss Not everyone with prediabetes needs toÂ lose weight. But if youâreÂ overweight, shedding 5%-10% of yourÂ body weight can lower your chances of diabetes by more than half. You may wonder whether carrying extra weight or being obesity causes diabetes. Thatâs something experts are still trying to figure out.Â What they do know is that extra bodyÂ fat, especially around your belly, sends out hormones that affect your appetite and causeÂinflammation. The cells that help you use insulin may get hurt in the process. Some experts think losing belly fat may help you get better control of your blood sugar. Prediabetes and sleep Studies showÂ sleep loss can make it harder to control your blood sugar and appetite. That may be why your chances ofÂ obesity andÂ type 2 diabetes go up if youÂ sleep less than 5-6 hours a night. Your chances are also higher if the quality of your sleep is bad. If you have ongoing sleep problems, skip your afternoonÂ caffeine. Youâll also want to avoidÂ alcohol close to bedtime. Both can disrupt your slumber. If that doesnât help, talk to your doctor. They can help treat yourÂinsomnia. Quit smoking Studies show people who smoke have a higher chance of prediabetes than nonsmokers. High levels of nicotine make it harder for your body to use insulin. CigaretteÂ smoking also damages your cells in a way that experts think leads to diabetes. Itâs important to talk to your doctor about how to quit. The same healthy lifestyle habits that treat prediabetes can help prevent it. Other things that can help: Unfortunately, prediabetes isn't always preventable. Some people whose genes put them at high risk for the condition may develop it even if they follow a healthy lifestyle. That's one reason it's important to keep up with your health care appointments. When you have prediabetes, your blood sugar levels are higher than they should be but not high enough to be considered diabetes. People with prediabetes are at higher risk for type 2 diabetes and the other health problems that can come along with it. You may be able to reverse it by making healthy lifestyle changes and, in some cases, by taking medicine to control your blood sugar. How often should I check my blood sugar for prediabetes? If you're healthy, your doctor will probably test your blood sugar about every 3 years. If you already have prediabetes, they'll probably do it at least once a year. Because prediabetes doesn't usually cause symptoms, regular checkups are important, especially if you have a family history of diabetes or other risk factors. Can prediabetes put my vision at risk? Research shows that it's possible for those with prediabetes to get diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to serious eye damage and sometimes blindness. If you have prediabetes, your doctor may recommend eye exams to check forretinopathy. Tell your doctor if you notice any changes in your vision.

Data can give you power. A huge part ofmanaging your diabetesis to keep your blood sugar under control, exercise, and eat right. Trackers can give you accurate feedback about how much, or how little, you are doing those things. Ever get a high phone bill? Then you know how looking closely at the specific charges can help you change your behavior. The next month, you'll be more careful about how much data you use or the number of texts you send. It's the same with tracking when you have diabetes. By getting an accurate view of your blood sugar along with how much you're exercising, eating, and sleepingÂ -- not just what you want to believe is true -- you can make some real improvements. Data =Â power. Research shows that tracking -- and the awareness that comes with it -- really works. Studies have found that people withdiabeteswho used apps -- to record food, exercise, and other behavior -- had better long-term blood sugar control. Another found that people who wore pedometers naturally increased their activity by 27%. By tracking steps and the calories you burn, fitness trackers can help anyone get fitter. But they have special benefits for people with diabetes. Here's why. Exercise.Â Physical activity is essential to controlling diabetes. It helps lower your blood sugar, helps your body useinsulinbetter, and makes you less likely to have other health complications. A fitness tracker could be just what you need to jump-start your exercise routine. Walking is great for people with diabetes, and counting your steps with a fitness device is an easy way to stay on track. Devices often track the number of calories you use throughout the day. Step up your daily calorie burn, and your blood sugar will benefit. Sleep. Many trackers have motion sensors that track your ZZZs. That can help if you have diabetes, since they tell you about your sleep quality and duration: Sleep problems and diabetesgo hand-in-hand, like sleep apnea and nerve pain at night. If your device records many restless nights, talk to your doctor. Waking up a lot in the night can be a sign that your blood sugar is getting too low. Not sleeping enough can push your blood sugar out of whack. So when you see how little sleep you're getting night after night, you might be inspired to turn off the TV an hour early and go to bed. Food.ÂMost fitness trackers have websites or apps to enter what you've eaten, or plan to eat, and then show you the calories. They also balance the calories you burn with the ones you eat, so if you work out a lot, you can eat a tad more. Many devices sync with diabetes-specific tracking apps for your carbs and insulin doses, so you can see all your data at once in easy-to-read graphs and charts. A wireless scale.ÂIf you'reoverweight, losing some pounds helps lower your chances that diabetes will get much worse. Think about trading your old bathroom scale for one that records data. Then, you can see trends in your weight over time. Wireless scales can automatically upload your weight to a secure website. If you'reÂreallyÂ into sharing, you can tweet your weigh-ins or post them on social media. This kind of support helps some people stay motivated. A home blood pressure cuff. High blood pressure and diabetes is a common and dangerous combination. Keep a closer eye on yours at home. Like scales, a wireless blood pressure monitor may automatically upload readings to a website so you can track them easily. Glucose monitors and apps.Â Read up on the new wave ofhigh-tech glucose monitorsand phone apps. Some gadgets can store your glucose monitor's readings in the cloud. That means you use less space on your phone or tablet. Browse the app store for your phone or tablet's operating system to find hundreds of diabetes apps -- to record carbs, set alarms for medication, and plan healthy meals. Look for ones with the highest ratings and try them. Check products from the same manufacturer -- like a fitness tracker, wireless scale, and glucose monitor -- to see if they sync so you get a more complete picture of your health. The high-tech revolution makes it easier to share info with your doctor. Now you can show them not only your glucose readings, but also your diet, exercise, and sleep. Once you track for a while, you'll start to see some connections. Is there something you need to improve? Also congratulate yourself for what you're doing right. When you self-track, you see the rewards of your healthy habits. That can give you very real reasons to stick with them.

Diabetescan harm your nerves. That damage, calledneuropathy, may be painful. It can happen in several ways, and they all seem to be related to blood sugar levels being too high for too long. To prevent it, work with your doctor to manage your blood sugar. You may hear your doctor mention the four types of diabetes-related neuropathy: peripheral, autonomic, proximal, and focal. This type usually affects the feet and legs. Rare cases affect the arms, abdomen, and back. Symptoms include: Early symptoms usually get better when your blood sugar is under control. There aremedicationsto help manage the discomfort. What you should do: This type usually affects the digestive system, especially the stomach. It can also affect the blood vessels, urinary system, and sex organs. In yourdigestive system: Symptoms include: What you should do:You may need to eat smaller meals and take medication to treat it. In blood vessels: Symptoms include: If you have it:Avoid standing up too quickly. You may also need to wear special stockings (ask your doctor about them) and take medicine. In Men: Symptoms include:They may not be able to have or keep an erection, or they may have âdryâ or reduced ejaculations. What you should do:See your doctor, because there are other possible causes than diabetes. Treatment includes: In Women: Symptoms include:Can include less vaginal lubrication and fewer or no orgasms. What you should do:See your doctor. Treatments include: In the Urinary System: Symptoms include: What you should do:Tell your doctor. Treatments may include: This type causes pain (usually on one side) in the thighs, hips, or buttocks. It can also lead to weakness in the legs. Most people with this condition need treatment, such as medication and physical therapy, for their weakness or pain. This type can appear suddenly and affect specific nerves, most often in the head, torso, or leg. It causes muscle weakness or pain. Symptoms include: What you should do:Tell your doctor about your symptoms. Focal neuropathy is painful and unpredictable. But it tends to improve by itself over weeks or months. It usually doesnât cause long-term damage. People with diabetes can also get other nerve-related conditions, such as nerve compressions (entrapment syndromes). Carpal tunnel syndromeis a very common type of entrapment syndrome. It causes numbness and tingling of in the hand and sometimes muscle weakness or pain. If you think you may have any type of nerve problem, talk with your doctor, so they can check for the cause.

When you havediabetes, you have a lot to manage. Highblood sugarcan lead to other conditions, likeeye problems. One of the most common ones is diabetic macular edema (DME). It's serious and can rob you of yourvision. That's a scary possibility, but knowing what to look out for and getting the right treatment can help protect your sight. Even if you don't notice problems, when you havediabetes,it's important you get youreyeschecked every year. If you do have a problem, see an eye doctor right away. Your eye doctor may refer you to an ophthalmologist who specializes in the retina and can provide treatment. If you catch it early, there's a chance you can stop long-term damage. High blood sugar weakens thebloodvessels in youreyes. That can make them leak or grow out of control in your retina, the light-sensitive area at the back of youreye. This is calleddiabetic retinopathy. When fluid seeps into your retina, it can cause diabetic macular edema. The leaking makes your retina swell, which hampers the work of your macula, the special, sensitive part that gives you sharpvision. DME doesnât always cause symptoms. But you may: If this happens to you, see your doctor right away. Before any testing, your doctor may ask you questions such as: You will need a thorougheye exam, which usually includes: If your doctor thinks you have DME, you may also need one or both of these tests: You may want to ask your doctor some questions to learn more about DME. These might include: To treat DME, your doctor may use drugs that are injected into your eyes tohelp stabilize the new blood vessels and stop leaking. They alsoslow the growth of new blood vessels.The drugs they will use are Anti-VEGF medications.Â VEGF and Ang-2 are proteins that can lead to vision loss in people with DME. They cause the growth of abnormal and fragile blood vessels. Most treatments target and block only VEGF.Â The main drugs include: Angiopoietin-2 is another protein involved in blood vessel formation. Ang-2 inhibitors help stabilize these fragile new blood vessels so they don't leak.Â VEGF/Ang-2 inhibitors include: In severe cases, you may also havelaser photocoagulation. A doctor will use a tiny laser on your eye to seal leaking blood vessels. You may need more than one treatment to control the problem. It's usually not painful, but you may have a slight stinging feeling when the laser touches you. Sometimes,steroidshots may help. Another treatment is a surgery calledvitrectomy. This is usually done because of bleeding (not macular edema). Your doctor takes out the fluid clouding your vision and replaces it with a clear solution. Â Thereâs a lot you can do to help prevent your condition from getting worse.Â First, manage your diabetes by controlling your blood sugar,blood pressure, andcholesterol. Diet changes, keeping ahealthy weight, and gettingexercisecan help you manage these problems. Talk with your doctor about the best plan for you. Also, donât sidestep regulareye exams. Symptoms can sneak up. Your doctor needs to see you to keep track of how your treatment is working. Have you lost some vision? Talk to your doctor about visual aids, like magnifying glasses, ifeyeglassesalone aren't enough. Ask themÂ about resources in your area that can help you learn skills for living withvision loss. DME can affect more than your eyes. Some people who have it also have heightened anxiety, depression, or other forms of distress that impact well-being. Unmanaged emotional or mental health issues can make it harder to seek care or stick with treatment. To care for your overall well-being with DME, you can:Â Take time to grieve.Â Vision problems can be frustrating, and you may feel sad when your sight changes. Itâs OK to take some time to mourn that loss. Tell your doctor if your feelings are too much to handle on your own.Â Talk to a mental health professional.ÂAsk your doctor to refer you to a therapist who works with people who have diabetes or other conditions that impact vision. They can teach you skills to address any emotional issues or behavioral barriers that stand in the way of your care.Â Partner with your doctor.ÂYou may feel more hopeful about your future if you find an effective treatment for DME and learn to manage your diabetes with medication or lifestyle changes.Â Join a support group.ÂYou can learn more about DME by talking to people who live with it. Ask your medical team if thereâs one-on-one or group peer support in your area. You may also find folks to connect with through groups such as the American Diabetes Association, American Foundation for the Blind, Prevent Blindness, or MD Support.Â Â Treatment can help protect your vision. It can greatly decrease your chance of losing your vision. Stay on top of your diabetes, and stick with your treatment plan. You'll have the best chance of maintaining your sight and staying independent. Long-term high blood sugar damages protective cells inside your blood vessels and weakens your vessel walls. When this happens in your eye, fluid can leak into your retina, causing swelling in your macula. Fragile new blood vessels may grow to replace the old ones. Over time, this process can result in a spectrum of vision changes. DME often causes general blurriness. You might find itâs like looking through the wrong prescription glasses. This fuzziness can make it hard to read, watch TV, drive safely, or clearly make out details around you. If you get a lot of swelling around your macula, your vision could get so out of focus that you go legally blind.Â Itâs hard to predict how fast your vision loss might set in, or how serious itâll be. But the good news is that treatment for DME works well for most people. And youâre less likely to have permanent vision changes when you work with your doctor to manage your diabetes and DME fast and early.Â But how your DME changes over time depends on several things, including:Â How well you control your blood sugar.Â DME usually happens when you go years with untreated high blood sugar. But thereâs a good chance you can lessen swelling and prevent further vision loss if you work with your doctor to get your diabetes under control.Â Â Your response to treatment.ÂThe goal is to slow or stop blood vessels from growing and leaking into your eye. The main way to do that is with a shot of medicine that goes directly into your eye, but thereâs more than one treatment for DME. Your sight may return to normal if you act early, but sometimes itâs not possible to restore all vision loss.Â Â How long youâve had DME.ÂThe severity of vision loss from DME often depends on how much fluid you have in your eye and how long itâs been there. The window of time where you can save your sight usually gets shorter the longer your condition goes untreated.Â Your race or ethnicity.People who are Black or Hispanic/Latinx are more likely to have serious vision loss from DME and less likely to get treatment for it, compared to some other racial and ethnic groups.Â Your genes may play a role, but health-related disparities often stem from social and economic inequalities that are more likely to affect communities of color. These so-called social determinants of health can make it harder to manage diabetes or related conditions.Â With good blood sugar control and medical treatment for DME, you may be able to get most or all of your vision back. But no matter what happens with your eyes, there are steps you can take to live well with diabetic macular edema. Try these tips:Â Â Look into low vision rehabilitation.A low vision specialist can go over behavioral changes or low vision aids thatâll help you adapt to all kinds of vision loss. Your doctor can refer you to one of these specialists even if you donât have a lot of sight problems right now. You may feel less anxious about your future if you plan ahead.Â Treat other health problems.Â Along with high blood sugar, medical conditions like high blood pressure and high cholesterol can further damage the blood vessels in your eyes. This kind of cellular stress can worsen vision problems already caused by DME.Â You may need to work with a mix of health professionals to treat your diabetes and guard against vision loss, including:Â See your eye doctor regularly.Â If you have diabetes, you should already get an annual checkup with an ophthalmologist (a doctor who specializes in eye diseases). You may need to go more often if you need eye shots for DME, at least for the first 1-3 years of treatment.Â Â Tap into all your resources.Â Active and aggressive blood sugar control, along with targeted therapies for DME, can help you see better for longer. So itâs important that you tell someone on your medical team if you have barriers to routine medical care or diabetes-related treatment. Your doctor, social worker, or nurse navigator may connect you with local or national groups that can help:Â Find more information about assistance programs or other resources for people with diabetes or related eye diseases through the the American Diabetes Association and the American Academy of Ophthalmology.Â Consider disability insurance.ÂYou may never have any serious vision problems, but you might want to think about long-term disability insurance, just in case. Talk to your doctor about the chances that future vision loss could affect your ability to work. Ask about all your treatment options.Â Your doctor can help you manage your diabetes and DME with a treatment plan that fits your lifestyle. This might include other medications besides an eye shot, lifestyle changes, or clinical trials that are in your area.Â For more information about the eye conditions related to diabetes, go to the web site of theAmerican Diabetes Association.

Insulin is a hormone that your pancreas makes to allow cells to use glucose. When your body isn't making or using insulin the way it should, you can take manufactured insulin to help control your blood sugar.Most people take insulin by injecting it into the skin, though thereâs also a version that you inhale. If you havetype 1 diabetes, you need insulin because your pancreas no longer makes the hormone. If you havetype 2 diabetes, you may need insulin, though many people with this form of the disease can control their blood sugar without it. Â Â Â Â Â Â Many forms of insulin treat diabetes. They're grouped by how fast they start to work and how long their effects last. Thetypes of insulininclude: Rapid-acting:This type of insulin starts to work in about 15 minutes and lasts for 1 to 5 hours, depending on which type you use. You take rapid-acting insulin before a meal and itâs usually paired with a longer-acting form of insulin.Â Short-acting:Also called regular insulin, this form takes about 30 minutes to work fully and lasts 3 to 8 hours. You should take short-acting insulin 30 to 60 minutes before a meal.Â Where you inject insulin matters. Your body will absorb it most evenly if you inject it into your belly, but don't always inject into the same spot. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) Intermediate-acting:Often combined with rapid- or short-acting insulin, intermediate-acting insulin covers your insulin needs for about half a day. Some people use it overnight. Intermediate-acting insulin starts working in an hour or two, and takes 2 to 4 hours to reach peak effect.Â Long-acting:This form provides a full day of insulin coverage. You will probably use a shorter-acting type of insulin with it.Â Premixed:There are several forms of premixed insulin, including Humulin, Novolog, and others. These varieties combine short-acting and intermediate-acting insulins in one bottle or insulin pen, which some people find easier to administer.Â Â What is glargine insulin used for? Glargine insulin is a type of long-acting insulin, which lasts for about 1 day.Â There are several options for taking insulin. Each method for administering insulin has its own technique. Your doctor can help you choose the one that works best for you.Â Ways to take insulin The major options for taking insulin include: Syringes:ÂMost people who use insulin administer it with a syringe, which is a tube attached to a needle that can be used to inject medicine into the body. To prepare the syringe, place the needle into a bottle of insulin and withdraw the right dose. Then you or your caregiver insert the needle into your body and inject the insulin.Â Pens:Â Similar to a syringe, an insulin pen uses a needle to inject the medicine into your body. But pens are prefilled with insulin, so you donât need to fill them from a bottle. Some insulin pens are disposable, while others can be reused by inserting a new cartridge of insulin. Pens are more convenient than syringes but more expensive to use.Â Pumps:Aninsulin pumpis a small computer that you wear on your body. It has a container full of insulin and a hose with a needle on the end, which you insert into your body. You can instruct the computer to provide a low, steady stream of insulin all day or deliver a âbolusâ of insulin after you eat a meal to control your blood sugar.Â Inhalers:Â If you use rapid-acting insulin, you have the option to inhale it instead of injecting. To use Afrezza, which has been available in the United States since 2015, you place an oral inhaler to your mouth and breathe the medicine into your lungs.Â Best insulin injection sites The place on the body where you give yourself the shot may matter. You'll absorb insulin the most evenly when you inject it into your belly. The next best places to inject it are your arms, thighs, and buttocks. Make it a habit to inject insulin at the same general area of your body, but change up the exact injection spot. Some doctors recommend spacing out injection sites by at least the width of one finger or slightly more if you use an insulin pump. This helps lessen scarring under the skin. If you develop hard lumps in your injection site, you may have scarring and need to use a different injection site.Â Which is the least painful spot to inject insulin? One small study found that people withdiabetesconsidered insulin injections in the belly to be less painful than injections in the upper arm or thigh. However, these patients also said that they didnât think insulin injections were very painful to begin with. The belly is also the best place to inject insulin, since you absorb the medicine more evenly. Be sure to insert the needle at least a few inches from your belly button.Â Your doctor will work with you to prescribe the type of insulin that's best for you and your diabetes. Making that choice will depend on many things, including: Your doctor may prescribe more than one type. You might need to take insulin more than once daily, to space your doses throughout the day, or to add other medicines. Afrezza, a rapid-acting inhaled insulin, is FDA-approved for use before meals for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The drug peaks in your blood in about 15-20 minutes and it clears your body in 2-3 hours. It must be used along with long-acting insulin in people with type 1 diabetes. The chart below lists the types of injectable insulin with details aboutonset(the length of time before insulin reaches the bloodstream and begins to lower blood sugar),peak(the time period when it best lowers blood sugar) andduration(how long insulin continues to work). These three things may vary. The final column offers some insight into the "coverage" provided by the different insulin types in relation to mealtime. Â Follow your doctor's guidelines on when to take your insulin. The time span between your shot and meals may vary depending on the type you use. In general, though, you should coordinate your injection with a meal. You want to time your shot so that the glucose from your food gets into your system at about the same time that the insulin starts to work. This will help your body use the glucose and avoid low blood sugar reactions. From the chart above, the "onset" column shows when the insulin will begin to work in your body. You want that to happen at the same time you're absorbing food. Good timing will help you avoid low blood sugar levels. Â Long-acting insulins arenât tied to mealtimes. Youâll take detemir (Levemir)once or twice a day no matter when you eat. And youâll take glargine (Basaglar, Lantus, Toujeo)once a day, always at the same time. Deglutec is taken once a day, and the time of day can be flexible. But some people do have to pair a long-acting insulin with a shorter-acting type or another medication that does have to be taken at mealtime. Rapid-acting products can also be taken right after you eat, rather than 15 minutes before mealtime. You can take some of them at bedtime. For more information about when to take insulin, read the "dosing and administration" section of the insulin product package insert that came with your insulin product, or talk with your doctor. The major side effects include: With inhaled insulin, there's a chance that your lungs could tighten suddenly if you haveasthmaor the lung diseaseCOPD. Always have two bottles of each type you use on hand. You don't need to refrigerate vials of insulin that you're using. A good rule of thumb is that if thetemperatureis comfortable for you, the insulin is safe. You can store the bottle that you're using at room temperature (not higher than 80 F) for 30 days. You don't want it to get too hot or too cold, and keep it out of direct sunlight. Keep your extra backup bottles in the refrigerator. The night before you're going to start using a new bottle, take it out and let it warm up. Don't let your insulin freeze. Always look at your insulin inside the bottle before you draw it into the syringe. Rapid-acting, short-acting, and certain long-acting types should be clear. Other forms may look cloudy, but they shouldn't have clumps. If you carry a bottle with you, be careful not to shake it. That makes air bubbles, which can change the amount of insulin you get when you withdraw it for an injection. For insulin pens, check the package insert for storage instructions. Check the directions on the package. You should keep a sealed package in the refrigerator until you're ready to start using it. If you don't, you must use it within 10 days. You can refrigerate packages you've opened, but let a cartridge warm up to room temperature for 10 minutes before you use it. There are many forms of insulin, which differ by how long it takes them to start working, reach their peak effectiveness, and stop working. Your doctor can help you determine which insulin or combination of the different types of insulin is right for you. There are also different ways to take insulin, so you can choose the option that you find convenient and easiest to use.Â Â How many types of human insulin are there? There are five general types of insulin made for treating diabetes. All types of insulin help cells use glucose for energy. The different types of insulin vary according to how rapidly they go to work and last in the body.Â The five main types of insulin are: How long does Novolog last? Novolog (the brand name for insulin aspart) lasts 3 to 5 hours. Novolog is a rapid-acting insulin. It begins working in as little as 10 minutes and reaches peak effectiveness in 40 to 50 minutes.Â Which insulin is best? No form of insulin is best. Each category of insulin has unique properties that determine how long it takes to work, reach its peak effectiveness, and stop working. Using a combination of different types of insulin can help you control blood sugar.Â Does type 2 diabetes require insulin? People with type 2 diabetes who canât control their blood sugar by making lifestyle changes and taking other diabetes treatments may need to use insulin. Some people with type 2 diabetes use insulin and otherdiabetes treatments.Â Is Lantus a long-acting insulin? Lantus is a long-acting insulin. Its effects last up to 1 day. There are other types of long-acting insulins, including Basaglar and Toujeo.Â SOURCES: Thomson Micromedex.Â Sanofi-Aventis Group in the United States.Â New Zealand Ministry of Health.

Heart disease is common in people with diabetes. In general, the risk of heart disease death andstrokeis more than twice as high in people with diabetes. While all people with diabetes have an increased chance of developing heart disease, the condition is more common in those withtype 2 diabetes. In fact, heart disease is the number one cause of death among people with type 2 diabetes. The Framingham Study was one of the first pieces of evidence to show that people with diabetes are more vulnerable to heart disease than those people who did not have diabetes. The Framingham Study looked at generations of people, including those with diabetes, to try to determine the health risk factors for developing heart disease. It showed that multiple health factors -- including diabetes -- could increase the possibility of developing heart disease. Aside from diabetes, other health problems associated with heart disease include high blood pressure, smoking, highcholesterol levels, and a family history of early heart disease. The more health risk factors a person has for heart disease, the higher the chances that they will develop heart disease and even die from it. Just like anyone else, people with diabetes have an increased risk of dying from heart disease if they have more health risk factors. However, the probability of dying from heart disease is 2 to 4 times higher in a person with diabetes. So, while a person with one health risk factor, such as high blood pressure, may have a certain chance of dying from heart disease, a person with diabetes has double or even quadruple the risk of dying. For example, one medical study found that people with diabetes who had no other health risk factors for heart disease were 5 times more likely to die of heart disease than those without. Another medical study showed that people with diabetes, no matter the number of other heart disease risk factors, were as likely to have aheart attackas someone without diabetes who has already had a heart attack. Heart disease experts recommend that all people with diabetes have their heart disease risk factors treated as aggressively as people who have already had heart attacks. The most common cause of heart disease in a person with diabetes is hardening of thecoronary arteries oratherosclerosis, which is a buildup of cholesterol in the blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrition to the heart. When thecholesterolplaques can break apart or rupture, the body tries to repair theplaquerupture by sending platelets to seal it up.Â Because the artery is small, the platelets could block the flow of blood, not allowing for oxygen delivery and a heart attack develops. The same process can happen in all of the arteries in the body, resulting in lack of blood to the brain, causing a stroke or lack of blood to the feet, hands, or arms causing peripheral vascular disease. Not only are people with diabetes at higher risk for heart disease, they're also at higher risk for heart failure, a serious medical condition in which the heart is unable to pump blood adequately. This can lead to fluid build-up in the lungs that causes difficulty breathing, or fluid retention in other parts of the body (especially the legs) that causes swelling. Thesymptoms of a heart attackinclude: Remember not everyone has pain and these other classic symptoms with a heart attack. This is especially true for women. *If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, you should call your doctor, call 911, or go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Peripheral vascular disease has the following symptoms: There are several treatment options for heart disease in those with diabetes, depending on the severity of the heart disease, including: Peripheral vascular disease is treated by: The best way to prevent heart disease is to take good care of yourself and your diabetes.
