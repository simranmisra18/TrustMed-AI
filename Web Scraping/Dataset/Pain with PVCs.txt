Hello Everyone,
i have been suffering from PVCs since my 20s and I’m in my mid-fifties now. like many others, I’ve had good days and some that were pretty frightening. I do have mild atrial enlargement but o/w heart is okay. the last several months I have experienced short pains in my mid chest region which goes along with the PVCs. This sometimes makes me feel a little winded Does anyone else have a similar experience?
