Hello,
About 4 years ago i started having issues, feeling tightness in my chest, shortness of breath, unbalance feeling, and headaches. i have had about 6 episodes since then, where I’m struggling breathing, my heart rate and bp goes up, sweating, then I freak out. After my episodes i am extremely tired. I have been put on anxiety and high blood pressure meds. The unbalance feeling never goes away and the sharp chest pains still happen throughout my day. i have been to see cardiologists and neurologists. Cardiologists says there is nothing wrong with my heart and the neuologist has diagnosed me with General ANXIETY disorder Anyone have any advice. The only time i my symptoms subside is when im working out or busy doing physical activity. I still feel like something my be wrong with me physically. Any thought?
