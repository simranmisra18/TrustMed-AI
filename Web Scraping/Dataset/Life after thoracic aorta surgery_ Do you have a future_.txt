Hi all. Can't stress enough how glad I am to find this forum and community. I have only recently (3 weeks ago) been diagnosed with 4.5 thoracic aorta aneurysm and I am deeply depressed and stressed about it. Cant get out of my head the worst case scenario and struggle to sleep. I am 6 fit tall and after I lost some weight I am around 250lbs but muscular r , ex crossfit enthusiast (which apparently cause my aneurysm) and I train field trial dogs which means a lot of hiking and walking. I feel like my life will end. I struggle with several questions in my head that cause me anxiety. I am 45 and work as Bussiness Development Manager in a food company so I am afraid if my carreer will end after a possible operation. I cannot affort not to work rightnow and retirement looks so far away for me. My doctor told me to continue my life as before just quit lifting heavy and focus on aerobic cardio and excersises because my treadmill stress test came out excellent and not to worry. I have to go back in a few weeks to discuss medicine . Now he said we need to monitor it . I do not smoke , drink maybe 2 glasses of wine on the weekend and I am under no medication. Feel like I am broken and anxious. If eventually I need to go through surgery can I still work? (office job)!

I was diagnosed aged 59 with an ascending aortic aneurysm, now 4.7cm or possibly more (I will find out next month). The most important thing is to get yourself referred to a major centre and be assessed and monitored by a cardiologist who specialises in aneurysmal disease. I’m in London and now at St Thomas’s; a number of other centres are available. My diagnosis was at St George’s when I volunteered for a sports cardiology study; I was advised to stop competing (at triathlon) and avoid heavy lifting. But I’ve continued with my job as a pool lifeguard (and lifeguard trainer) and fitness adviser. I haven’t yet had surgery. So the short answer to your question is that while yes, this diagnosis comes as a total shock and takes time to get used to, it’s not a disaster. There are a number of surgical options for when the time comes (thresholds vary with genetics; 5.5cm is standard but this may well come down to 5.0 next year when guidelines are revised, and may be lower with some genetic conditions). Take a good look at PEARS surgery (full details on the website www.exstent.com) as well as the standard root replacement operations; no reason why you shouldn’t continue working and following an active lifestyle afterwards.

Thank you Julian. I am from Cyprus and we do have quite good cardiologists and cardio-surgeons that have been practising in big medical centers in the Uk and Europe.There is a few well established and known Medical centers here so I think that I will have relatively good treatment if needed. Dunno if its growing cause i found out a month ago. Doctor didn’t seem to worry . After a long cardio stress test and ultra sound he send me for CT scan, where he confirmed his findings. Said to continue life as normal , loose more weight, quit crossfit and avoid lifting things over 25kg for prolonged period of time and get back for further monitoring in 6months. No medication prescribed .

Hi Timos, sounds like you have had appropriate medical investigation and advice, which is a good position to be in. CT is much more reliable than Echo for measurement (though Echo is good for assessing the valves, which is important). Typically, growth in these things is very slow, but that can only be assessed over a year or more with repeated monitoring. So they’re doing the right thing there. If they’re happy with your blood pressure that’s also very good. It takes time to come to terms with these things, but it does get better. Knowing there’s an issue before it becomes an emergency is a massive advantage and hopefully means it never does. Finding doctors/surgeons who specialise in the area and building a relationship with them over time is one of the best things you can do. At 4.5cm your immediate risk is very low, especially now you know about it. All the best!

Hi there, I was diagnosed age 59 with ascending aortic aneurysm of 6cm. I was given the same advice as you, no heavy lifting and moderate exercise. I also need a replacement aortic valve and I choose mechanical as tissue ones tend to need replacing after 10 years and I would be 69 and maybe not fare so well. My surgery was on 16th December 2014, I was in hospital for 5 days. On Christmas Day I walked the 300 metres to my daughters house, with company of course! From then on I recovered quickly. I was driving after 6 weeks( I could have driven sooner but car insurance doesn’t cover you for the first 6 weeks after major surgery) The only pain I had of any significance was from underarms to chest only when I lifted arms, which is from the muscles being pulled around during surgery. I have done everything I used to do since then, my grandchildren were toddlers at the time and I could lift them after 3 months, I completely decorated a room myself after 6 months, I pushed my husband around in a wheelchair for 18 months until he sadly passed away last year. Please don’t worry, the operation isn’t as traumatic as it sounds and recovery is fairly quick, considering the operation! As soon as you feel up to it you can go back to work and eventually be able to go back to all your pre-operation activities. You will definitely be able to work and enjoy life as before!

I had no diagnosis to worry about so can only explain how I coped after I had an aortic dissection aged 54. I was fit, had run 5 marathons and was running regularly. My weight was fine, no high BP and only issue was migraines and menopause! I had seen a cardiologist 10yrs previously to see if a heart issue was causing migraines but nothing was detected. Here I am 3.5 yrs after waking up in intensive care 4 days after suffering an ascending aortic dissection and cardiac arrest, to find I had now a mechanical aortic valve and a few repairs to my aorta and heart. ( A bicuspid aortic valve was the culprit).Life is great finally.
It took a few months to feel normal and for scars to start healing. On reflection it took 3 years to fine tune the drugs to suit me. The tiredness, dizzy spells, being slightly bloated, worried about being able to do my job well, thinking I’m old and past it have gone. For me starting on 5mg Bisoprolol could have been like putting the brakes on. I wasn’t allowed to run, had to take afternoon naps, couldn’t sleep flat, had spongy ankles, flabby belly, couldn’t build up muscle and had no strength. I was quite miserable, but not complaining, those amazing NHS surgeons had saved my life, so I accepted how I felt. Now I’m taking 1.25mg Bisoprolol and 50mg Losartan and its like I’ve been recharged. I have energy, enthusiasm, work is great and I have just started playing golf and do yoga.
My cardiologist is great, but still needed time to see how my body was responding to the drugs, but thankfully realised my slow heart rate could be holding me back ( it was only 48 bpm). Accept the miracle of treatment, and accept it takes time to get back to who you want to be. Do give your Drs feedback so they can help.

Hi, I am 66 just retiring and diagnosed with an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm which was totally out of the blue.
The 2 appointment for operation were cancelled, one at the last minute. Now I have been told the original surgeon will not be doing it, now have to go this coming week to meet another one
The waiting for this to happen from the cancelled operation has caused me to feel mentally unwell, and very stressed and upset which I have never experienced before and now feeling frightened of the outcome.
It was good to read this write up, but appreciate we are all different and will have different recovery, just want to come out of this in one piece having just retired with my wife, lots of plans for retirement.
Thank you again, it was good to read.
Best Wishes ChrisW

Hi Julian,
I am newly diagnosed with a Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm at 66, and was only found because I have had flyer through the door asking me if I wanted to go and be checked, which I did to find it was 5.2 and then went again about 3months later to find it was 5.5cm should have been in hospital 7th Dec but cancelled twice, physically I feel really well, mentally is where the problem is and finding it difficult to deal with, just retiring as well and all the plans went on hold…but as you best to know rather something happen and then know. Another appt next week to hopefully sort out the next step with the op.
I am not finding it easy, but I must say your responses to people that I have read is really supportive and comforting so well done for that, and a big thank you from me as I can see also from others.
Take care…ChrisW
