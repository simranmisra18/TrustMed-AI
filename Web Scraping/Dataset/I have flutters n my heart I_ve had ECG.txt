i am fed up with flutters in my heart it’s mostly in day by evening it seems to settle I’ve had tests done ECG heart tested with a stethoscope and bloods done they say it’s Anxiety I am on Propranolol 10mgs twice a day doc giving Mr another beta blockers tgat target the heart more haven’t took it yet be scared with different meds… I am 63 and so worried I feel my pulse but my heart just beats normal I can’t feel no flutters but it does feels fluttering if that make sense can anyone put me at ease I do have Tachycardia for 13 yrs but it’s sorted with beta blockers.
