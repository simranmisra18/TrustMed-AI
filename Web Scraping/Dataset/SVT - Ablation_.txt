Hi everyone, i would really appreciate some advice. im a 27 year old female. i remember having svt (junctional tachycardia) episodes as far back as around 14. i’ve always been active and love sports, seem to have more frequent episodes when im older. I was open to cardiology around 7 years ago, who put it down to innapropriate sinus tachycardia which never made sense to me. the episodes until recently always stopped on their own. however can last from a few seconds to around an hour. Last month i had an episode lasting 2 hours so went to a&e and bisoprolol did the trick (thankfully no adenosine needed). i am very sporty, have stopped sport, caffeine, alcohol etc. Episodes happen nesrly every time i exercise. i tried verapamil unsuccesfully, and not allowed beta blockers due to asthma. i’ve been offered an ablation but i am so scared. however i feel like i have no other option as it’s starting to affect my quality of life and mental health. any advice is much appreciated x

to give you an example. i was on the threatre bed at 1pm and I was in recovery for 2.30. it is uncomfortable when they bring you into arrhythmia and I needed drugs to put me more relaxed.

I had SVT, sounding very similar to the history of yours. I had ablation when i was 22 (2009, im now 36) and it was the best decision ever! i got my life back and i would 100% have it done again if i needed to It was so quick, in and out within half a day and i cannot tell you how it changed my life and made me ‘me’ again. xx

I would love to have an ablation (assuming it works!) – I am 78 and SVT episodes really knock my confidence as I always have to go to A&E for adenosine – twice this year. No one has ever mentioned ablation to me but I will ask about it at my next consultation – by phone – in four months’ time. Feeling a bit abandoned at the moment because it’s affecting my life profoundly but no one seems to take it seriously.

Has no one told you that ablations are hardly ever 100% successful? How high does your heart rate go in your episodes? Mine once got stuck at 190.
