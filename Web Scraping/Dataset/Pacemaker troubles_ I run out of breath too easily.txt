Greetings. I received a pacemaker (2 wires) in Nov. 2023 because I suffer from congestive heart failure and atrial flutter. I expected, naively, it would be like receiving a new heart. Instead, I run out of breath too easily when walking. My pacemaker is set at 60 beats, and although it can be set to motion-activated variable speed, it would then speed up to 120, which many people do not like according to my cardio clinic. Is this normal? I do walk 40-60 minutes a day inside my house to try strengthening my lungs to compensate, but I would appreciate other people’s experiences. Thank you all.
