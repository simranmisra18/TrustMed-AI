Hello,
I’ve been experiencing Atrial Fibrillation for the last year, or so. Specifically, Tachycardia, in the form of Torsades des pointes.
After many months of tests and monitoring, upon my last assessment, the doctor provided a choice between Ablation, or the drug, Dofetilide.
Has any readers here taken Dofetilide, and if so, what has been your experience?
Would you recommend it over Ablation?
I’m am trying to gather as much real world insight into Dofetilide , as to whether it’s effective, any common side effects, before i make a choice. Any insight would be much appreciated.
Thank you and good health to you all!
