Hello. Ive been experiencing high blood pressure. 160/100. GP started me on Ramipril which I took for a week but started to get a dry cough then a feeling of something in my throat, particularly when I swallow saliva. So I’ve been switched to Losartan. The throat lump went away but now I’m 10 days into taking the Losartan and the weird throat issue is back. It feels a bit like something is stuck in my throat. Is this common with this type of medication? I’m on 25mg a day. I’m also feeling a bit fatigued. Even going up stairs is tiring. GP hasn’t examined my throat. I just had a phone consultation with a pharmacist who is based in the surgery and he switched my meds. I’m in my early 50s and this is my first time on these meds. Im trying to eat healthier , reduced salt intake and trying to walk for 30 mins everyday. Any advice very welcome.
