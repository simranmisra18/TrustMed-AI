My sympathies. You are not alone. I have been having frequent PVCs for over 2 years now. So I read that the heart does about 100,000 beats per day on average, so if you are having 2,000 per day then that is just 2% of your beats. My cardiologist told me that a PVC burden of <10% is nothing to worry about, so sounds like you are fine. My holter monitor reported a burden of 13% which was excessive, so I have been on medication ever since. I was initially prescribed Beta Blockers but they did not work, so I moved on to Flecainide which has improved my condition significantly. I still get PVCs but much less than I used to. So I’ll be keeping an eye on it. Anyway, sounds like it comes down to percentages, and that 10% is the threshold . All the best
