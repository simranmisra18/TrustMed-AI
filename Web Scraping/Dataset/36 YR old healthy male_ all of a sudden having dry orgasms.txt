I am a overall healthy 36 yr old male, I have never had problems with erections or having an orgasm that produced quite a bit of semen, been like this my entire life. Now all of a sudden in the past 4 days I’ve had 3 dry orgasms in a row, not completely dry but if I were to estimate only about 5-10% of my normal amount. This is really concerning for me as I intend on having kids in the future. I went down the google rabbit hole and the stuff sounds scary as hell, ranging from retrograde ejaculation to cancer. I read that a sign of retrograde ejaculation is that your urine becomes cloudy after because it is mixed with your semen and I have not noticed this at all, my urine is unchanged (medium to light yellow). Can anyone shed some light to my situation? I have an appointment with a urologist next week but I’m literally losing sleep over this because of how nervous I am.

First, stop worrying. Worrying will only raise your cortisol stress hormones and as everyone knows nothing kills performance on the horizontal plane quite like fear. Look at hormones (testosterone, estrogen, cortisol), diabetes & insulin resistance and check for enlarged prostate. Would also get the full panel on thyroid just to make sure there are no issues. There are several things that lower testosterone including excessive beer consumption (your colon generates female hormones for days after a night of drinking beer with the guys) and excessive coffee consumption, exposure to synthetic estrogen found in anti-perspirant, shampoos, cleaning products, and plastic food containers, plastic lining in tinned food (use glass containers, go for organic natural shampoo, Schmidt’s underarm deodorant, wear gloves when using cleaning products), and the big one, insulin resistance/Type II. Certain foods have phyto-estrogens ie. licorice, soy products other than fully fermented soy, saw palmetto supplements. If you have a muffin top, your body will start producing estradiol, a man’s equivalent to estrogen affecting your testosterone to estrogen ratio…in the wrong direction. Diabetes and its precursor, insulin resistance are one of the causes for dry ejac. Insulin resistance (aka pre-diabetes) shows up 10 yrs before you develop Type II. You test for insulin resistance with 2 tests: fasting insulin and the glucose test (after drinking pure glucose, they test your insulin to see if it returns to normal after 2 hrs or stays high indicating your body is insulin resistant so your body has to make more). When your body is insulin resistant, it stores energy in your fat cells and you gain weight leading to higher estradiol and lower testosterone. Best way to reverse insulin resistance is reduce sugar, and anything that rapidly releases sugar during digestion ie. all refined carbohydrates…baked goods, bread, pasta, crackers; eliminate ultra-processed foods high in sugar, carbohydrates, chemicals, industrial seed oils; pop, juice & junk food. You also want to lower sugary fruit, seeds (rice, wheat, oats, corn) and starches (root vegetables where a plant stores sugar). Farmers fatten livestock with grains and corn…works exactly the same with humans. Think of this as an early wake up call. If you catch insulin resistance early, you can lower your risk of all chronic diseases…cancer, heart disease, liver disease, kidney failure, Alzheimers. In the UK, couples who were unable to have children recovered their fertility after adopting a low carb diet. Dr. Unwin in the UK or Dr. Jason Fung have low carb diets to reverse diabetes and insulin resistance. In terms of supplements, Pine pollen raises testosterone levels. Avoid Beet root and beet root powder like the plague. Some men take this thinking they will raise nitrous oxide for better performance and this stuff can create kidney stones and all kinds of other problems. Best thing you can eat for a healthy male body is grass fed beef for B complex vitamins, and iron and grass fed eggs. Weight bearing exercise helps to burn off excess energy and build muscle.
