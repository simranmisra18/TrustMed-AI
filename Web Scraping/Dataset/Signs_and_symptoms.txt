Tiredness, or fatigue, means having less energy than usual. People feel exhausted - mentally, physically or both. Tiredness is a normal part of life and more significant at particular times of life, such as having a young family, but if it persists it may warrant some investigations to check for an underlying medical problem.

What is the treatment for tiredness?
Everyone experiences tiredness (fatigue) from time to time. Tiredness that drags on for no apparent reason can be very difficult and it's an extremely common symptom.
One UK survey of over 15,000 people found that 10-18% reported tiredness that lasted for one month or longer, and a study looking at GP databases found that 1.5 in 100 people see their doctor about new tiredness every year. It's so common that doctors have an acronym for it - TATT which means "tired all the time".

Tiredness may be due to a wide range of physical illnesses. Examples include:
A low iron level (anaemia).

Most physical causes of tiredness will also cause other symptoms, such as weight loss or gain, or shortness of breath, but some causes of tiredness may not cause any other symptoms.
Psychological causes of tiredness
Tiredness that cannot be explained by any physical problem is much more common than tiredness that can. Both anxiety and depression can cause significant tiredness. Eating disorders can also cause tiredness. Any cause of a sleep problem will also cause tiredness during the day.
Stress is a common cause of tiredness, either because it interferes with sleep or because of the effect of having constant high levels of stress and worry. Causes of stress may include bereavement, stress at work and relationship problems including domestic violence.
Boredom may also cause tiredness.
Lifestyle causes of tiredness
Tiredness is often caused by lifestyle. Lifestyle causes of tiredness include:
Drinking too much alcohol.

Signs and symptoms
When the Rolling Stones sang '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction', I don't think they were referring to yawning. But we all know how satisfying a good yawn can be. One user of our forums complained that her urge to yawn was bordering on excessive though. So let's explore what could cause such a phenomenon.

Signs and symptoms
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), sometimes known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) , is a condition where there is long-term disabling tiredness (fatigue). Most people with also have one or more other symptoms such as muscular pains, joint pains, disturbed sleep patterns, poor concentration or headaches. The cause is not known.
by Dr Colin Tidy, MRCGP
What tests are there for tiredness?
If tiredness is persisting or if it is associated with other symptoms, medical advice should be sought in order to see if there is an underlying cause. The clinician will need to ask some questions and may arrange an examination and some blood tests.
Questions you may be asked
These are to help give some clues about the cause of the tiredness, and may include:
Do you have any other symptoms?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Sleep: Do you sleep well? Is your sleep interrupted? Do you snore? Has your partner noticed any changes to your breathing at night?

Blood tests for tiredness
Blood tests are often suggested to rule out physical causes of the tiredness. In most cases these turn out to be normal. This might include tests to rule out:
Low iron levels (anaemia).

Other tests
Usually no other tests are needed but, if specific medical conditions are suspected, other tests such as a chest X-ray might be necessary.
Do I need to see a doctor?
There is no need to seek medical advice if the cause of the tiredness is obvious but if it persists, despite making appropriate lifestyle changes, then it is sensible to request a medical opinion.
Symptoms which make it more important to seek medical advice include tiredness in addition to:
Weight loss, without trying to lose weight.

What is the treatment for tiredness?
There is no specific treatment for tiredness. The secret is to try to narrow down the cause and then do something about that.
Exercise as a treatment
It may seem bizarre, but exercise or physical activity can actually be remarkably effective for treating tiredness. Any moderate exercise, such as walking, swimming or cycling, can help reduce tiredness. Regular exercise is also an excellent way to stay healthy.
Try to improve your sleep
If you are not sleeping well at night, it is tempting to try to "make up for this" by taking naps during the day. This does not help and often results in sleeping less well at night due to the body clock being out of sync. There are lots of ways you can try to improve your sleep when suffering from insomnia and this should improve symptoms of tiredness.
Treatments for medical conditions that cause tiredness
Medical conditions causing tiredness can usually be treated and this often resolves the tiredness.
For example, in anaemia with low iron levels, iron supplements can be used to treat this and the tiredness will resolve as the blood count increases. However, any underlying cause for the anaemia would need to be found and treated. For example, if it is due to heavy periods, then using medicines to make the periods lighter will help. If there is a suspicion that the anaemia might be due to a serious condition, such as bowel cancer, then further tests and referral to a specialist would be needed.
Treatments for medications that cause tiredness
If the cause is a side-effect of medication, it may be that this can be changed to something without this side effect.
Treatments for tiredness caused by chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)
If symptoms are thought to be due to CFS then a referral to a specialist team is sometimes made. This team can make the diagnosis and then help with psychological therapy and medication. This service is not always available everywhere.
Treatments for tiredness caused by anxiety or depression
Anxiety or depression can be helped by talking therapy (counselling), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or medication.
Treatments for tiredness caused by stress
If stress is the cause, it is worth taking the time to think and talk about possible ways to reduce this. Is there something which can be changed? It may be that some things need to be re-prioritised.
If work is the stressful problem, it might be possible to change roles, change hours or discuss ways to reduce stress with a manager. If there isn't anything that can be done to change the situation then it might be possible to find things to balance out the stress and improve quality of life. There are a variety of ways to de-stress, such as:
Regular "me" time.

I have muscle weakness - what will the doctor do?
Summary
Muscle weakness is a common complaint but the word weakness can mean different things to different people - including tiredness, reduced power and failure to work at all.
What is muscle weakness?
The term muscle weakness can be used to describe three different things. The difference between these three types of muscle weakness is often vague and it is possible to have more than one of them. However, working out which one is the main problem can help doctors determine what is causing it. This is because some conditions tend to cause one type of weakness rather than another.
Primary or true muscle weakness
This is an inability to perform normal actions with the muscle, even on the first try. There is a reduction in the force which the muscle can exert, however hard the attempt is made. The muscle is not working properly - it has become abnormal.
When this kind of weakness occurs, the muscles are often floppier than usual and are reduced in bulkiness. It can happen, for example, following a stroke. It is also seen in a condition called muscular dystrophy (discussed further below). Both of these conditions result in weakened muscles which cannot move the usual load. It's a real change in muscle power.
Muscle tiredness
This is sometimes called asthenia. It is a sense of weariness or exhaustion felt when using the muscle. The muscle isn't genuinely weaker; it can still do its job but it takes more effort to manage it.
This type of weakness is often seen in people who have chronic fatigue syndrome, sleep disorders, depression, and chronic heart, lung, and kidney disease. It may be due to a reduction in the speed with which the muscle can get its energy supply.
Muscle 'fatigability'
Some muscle tiredness is mainly muscle 'fatigability' - the muscle starts off normally but tires very quickly and takes longer than normal to recover. This often goes along with muscle tiredness but is also particularly seen in some uncommon conditions such as myasthenia gravis and myotonic dystrophy.
What are the causes of muscle weakness?
Muscle weakness is commonly due to lack of exercise, ageing, muscle injury or pregnancy. It can also occur with long-term conditions such as diabetes or heart disease. There are many other possible causes, which include stroke, multiple sclerosis, and depression.
Lack of use
Lack of muscle fitness (deconditioning) is one of the most common causes of muscle weakness. It may occur as a result of an inactive (sedentary) lifestyle. If muscles are not used then the fibres within the muscles are partially replaced with fat. Muscle wasting will eventually occur; muscles become less bulky and more floppy.
Each fibre is just as strong but there aren't so many of them and they don't contract so effectively. This leads to easy tiring when trying to do things that would have been easier when the muscles were fit. The condition is reversible with sensible, regular exercise regimes. It gets worse with increasing age and takes longer to reverse.
Muscle power is greatest and the recovery times are shortest in our 20s and 30s. This is why most great athletes are in this age range. However, building of muscles through regular exercise can be done at any age. Many successful long-distance runners are aged over 40. Muscle tolerance for prolonged activity such as marathon running remains high for longer than that for the powerful, short-burst activities like sprinting.
It's always good to stay fit, regardless of age. Recovery from muscle and tendon injury, however, also becomes slower with increasing age. Improving fitness and muscle strength when older may require advice from trainers or physiotherapists to prevent injury to muscles which, at least at first, may not perform as well as hoped.
Ageing
Muscles tend to lose strength and bulk with age and they become weaker. Whilst most people accept this as the natural consequence of age - particularly great age - it is frustrating to be unable to do the things that were easily managed when younger.
Exercise is still beneficial and it is still possible to increase muscle power and strength with a careful and safe exercise routine. Injury recovery times are much longer with great age, balance is often impaired and thinner bones are easily broken.
Muscle weakness is one of the factors that defines someone as being "frail". Although this is often associated with being elderly, it is possible to be frail whilst younger. Exercise is important to avoid this.
Infections
Infections and illnesses are amongst the most common causes of temporary muscle fatigue. This is usually through muscle inflammation. Even though recovery is usual, if inflammation is severe (such as may occur during a bad bout of influenza), the weakness can last for several weeks.
Pregnancy
During and just after pregnancy, high levels of steroids in the blood, together with a tendency to be relatively lacking in iron (anaemia), can cause a feeling of muscle tiredness.
This is normal in pregnancy and whilst some exercise is still sensible, it is important to take care and to make adaptations for the change in posture caused by carrying the weight at the front.
Persistent (chronic) diseases
Many chronic diseases can cause muscle weakness. In some conditions this is due to reduced blood and nutrient supply to muscles.
Peripheral arterial disease: This is caused by narrowing of the arteries, usually due to the build-up of cholesterol. It's linked to smoking and diet. The blood supply to the muscles is slowed and this becomes particularly noticeable with exercise, as the blood supply can't keep up with the increased demand. Pain is often more noticeable than weakness but both can be a problem.
Diabetes: This can cause weakness and loss of fitness. Having raised blood sugar levels (and sometimes altered salt levels) puts muscles at a disadvantage too and they don't perform so well. In addition, as diabetes progresses, the blood supply to small nerves is lost. When the nerve serving a muscle fibre dies then the muscle fibre will also stop working. People with diabetes also have an increased tendency to narrowing of the arteries (see 'Peripheral arterial disease', above).
Heart disease - particularly heart failure: This can cause easy tiring of the muscles through a reduction in blood supply at times of high demand. This is because the heart is unable to keep up with the increased requirements of the exercising muscles as it can't pump blood as effectively as it should.
Chronic lung disease: Lung conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cause a reduction in the ability of the body to take in oxygen. Muscles require a fast supply of oxygen from the blood, particularly when exercising. Reduction in oxygen intake leads to easy tiring. Over time chronic lung disease may lead to muscle wasting, although this is mainly seen in advanced cases when blood oxygen levels start to drop.
Chronic kidney disease: This affects the whole body environment, both through an imbalance of the salts in the body and through a possible effect on calcium and vitamin D levels. Kidney disease also causes a build-up of harmful substances in the blood because the poorly functioning kidneys process them more slowly. This can lead to true muscle weakness as well as muscle tiredness.
Anaemia: This is a shortage of red blood cells. It has many causes, including heavy periods, poor diet, blood loss, pregnancy, genetic conditions, infections and cancers. It reduces the ability of the blood to carry oxygen to muscles, so they tire more easily. Anaemia often 'creeps' on quite slowly, so that significant muscle tiredness and breathlessness can develop before the condition is diagnosed.
Conditions affecting brain 'drive' to muscles
Anxiety: Generalised tiredness can be caused by anxiety. This is due to overactivity of the body's adrenaline (epinephrine) system.
Depression: General weariness and a feeling of generalised tiredness can also be caused by depression.
Note: Anxiety and depression are both conditions which tend to cause a sense of tiredness and 'fatigability' rather than true weakness.
Chronic pain: A general effect on energy levels can result from chronic pain. Like anxiety, it stimulates the production of chemical substances (hormones) in the body which respond to pain and injury. These chemicals lead to feelings of tiredness or fatigue. In chronic pain, true weakness can result as muscles may not be used due to pain and discomfort.
Muscle damage through injury
There are many ways in which muscles can be directly damaged. The most obvious is injury or trauma such as sporting injuries, pulls and sprains. In any muscle injury, bleeding from damaged muscle fibres occurs inside the muscle, followed by swelling and inflammation. This makes the muscle less strong and also painful to use. Localised pain is the primary symptom but weakness also results.
Medicines
Some medicines can cause muscle weakness and muscle damage as a side-effect or as part of an allergic reaction. Usually this begins as tiredness or fatigue. It can progress to permanent changes if the medicines are not stopped.
Commonly used medicines which can occasionally do this include statins (used to lower cholesterol levels), some antibiotics (including ciprofloxacin and penicillin) and anti-inflammatory painkillers (such as naproxen and diclofenac).
Long-term use of prescribed oral steroids or high doses of steroids (eg, if injected) also cause muscle weakness and wasting. This is an expected side-effect which anyone on long-term treatment is likely to experience and is one of the reasons that doctors try to avoid prescribing long-term or high-dose steroids.
Less commonly-used medicines which can cause muscle weakness and damage to muscles include:
Some heart medicines (for example, amiodarone).

Other substances

Uncommon causes of muscle weakness
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)
CFS is thought possibly to be triggered by certain viral infections such as glandular fever (Epstein-Barr virus) and flu (influenza) but it is poorly understood. Muscles are not inflamed but tire very easily. Patients often feel enormous effort is needed for muscle activity which they would previously have found easy.
In CFS, muscles are not usually wasted and they may have normal strength on testing. This is reassuring, as it means the chance of recovery to completely normal function is very high. CFS also causes weariness, with other activities like reading and socialising also becoming exhausting. Patients often show signs of depression and poor sleep.
Fibromyalgia
This condition resembles CFS. However, in fibromyalgia the muscles also become tender to touch and they tire extremely easily. They are not usually wasted and can demonstrate normal (although uncomfortable) strength on formal testing. People with fibromyalgia tend to complain more of the pain than the tiredness or weakness.
Underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)
In this condition, a shortage of thyroid hormone leads to generalised tiredness. In untreated hypothyroidism, muscle degeneration and wasting can develop. This can be severe and difficult to reverse. Hypothyroidism is a common condition but it is usually picked up early and treated before long-lasting muscle problems can result.
Electrolyte disorders and lack of fluid in the body (dehydration)
Problems of the balance of salts in the body, including dehydration through not drinking enough, cause muscle tiredness. This may be severe in extreme cases, such as dehydration during a marathon. Muscles work less well when there is an imbalance in the salts in the blood.
Conditions of muscle inflammation
Inflammatory diseases of muscle typically affect older adults and include conditions such as polymyalgia rheumatica (muscles of the shoulders and thighs become tender and weak), polymyositis and dermatomyositis.
Some of these conditions respond well to steroids (which need to be taken for many months before the condition resolves). Unfortunately, as explained above, steroids often also cause muscle wasting and weakness.
Conditions of generalised tissue or joint inflammation such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis can cause muscle weakness. In a small proportion of cases of rheumatoid arthritis, muscle weakness and tiredness may be the only sign of the disease for some considerable time.
Cancers
Cancers can cause muscle damage directly but the presence of cancer anywhere in the body can also cause generalised muscle tiredness. In advanced disease, general weight loss will also lead to true muscle weakness. Muscle weakness is not usually the first sign of a cancer but occurs later in the condition.
Nerve conditions which damage muscles
Conditions affecting nerves tend to lead to true muscle weakness. This is because if the nerve to a muscle fibre stops working, the muscle fibre can't work either and it will become floppy and eventually shrivel.
Neurological conditions: Muscle weakness can be caused by cerebrovascular disease such as a stroke and brain haemorrhage and spinal injury. Tumours in the brain can also lead to muscle weakness. Muscles which become partially or completely paralysed lose their normal strength and will eventually waste. Some recovery is possible but it will be slow and may not be complete.
Spine-related conditions: When nerves are damaged as they emerge from the spine (such as when people 'slip' a disc in the lower back or neck), weakness can result. When the discs slip out, they press on nerves headed lower down in the body. The weakness affects only the muscles served by the irritated or compressed nerve.
Other uncommon nerve conditions:
Multiple sclerosis (MS): This is caused by damage to nerves in the brain and spinal cord and can cause sudden paralysis of a muscle. This can recover partially but does not always do so.
Guillain-Barré syndrome: This is a post-viral paralysing disease which causes weakness and loss of muscle function from the fingers and toes upwards. It may last many months, although complete recovery is usual.
Parkinson's disease: This is a progressive disorder of movement, mainly affecting people aged over 60. In addition to muscle weakness, people with Parkinson's disease notice tremor and stiffness. They often have difficulty in starting and stopping movements. Depression and anxiety are more common in people with Parkinson's disease.
Rare causes of muscular weakness
Genetic conditions affecting muscles
Muscular dystrophies: These are inherited diseases which affect muscles. They are rare disorders but the best known and most common is Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This occurs in children and leads to gradual loss of muscle power from toddlerhood.
Some rare muscular dystrophies: These can present in adulthood and include Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome and the facioscapulohumeral dystrophies. They also cause gradual loss of power and function in muscles. Those who have these conditions may become wheelchair-bound.
Sarcoidosis: This is a rare disease in which clumps of cells (granulomas) form in skin, lungs and soft tissues, including muscles. The condition usually goes away after a few years but can become more progressive in some people.
Amyloidosis involves deposits of an abnormal protein called amyloid throughout the body, including muscles and kidneys. The amyloid damages the organs it attacks, including muscles.
Other rare causes: Direct damage to muscles can occur in rare inherited metabolic conditions. Examples include:
Glycogen storage diseases (in which glycogen, a carbohydrate, infiltrates muscles as well as other organs).
Glycogen storage diseases (in which glycogen, a carbohydrate, infiltrates muscles as well as other organs).
Even rarer, mitochondrial diseases which occur when the energy systems inside muscle cells don't work properly.
Even rarer, mitochondrial diseases which occur when the energy systems inside muscle cells don't work properly.
Myotonic dystrophy: This is a rare genetic muscle disorder in which muscles become extremely tired. Myotonic dystrophies are passed down through families and they tend to occur earlier and become worse as they move through the generations.
Conditions affecting nerves
Motor neurone disease (MND): This is a progressive disorder of the nerves which affects all parts of the body. Most forms of MND begin at the outer extremities, hands and feet and gradually move inwards. The condition can take months or years to progress but people with MND often quickly develop profound muscle weakness and wasting.
MND is most often seen in male patients over 50 years of age but there have been many notable exceptions to this, including the scientist Stephen Hawking.
Myasthenia gravis: This condition is an uncommon disorder in which muscles tire rapidly with a very long recovery time. This can be so extreme that patients can't keep their eyelids lifted and speech can become slurred.
Poisons: Poisonous substances can cause muscle weakness and paralysis through their effect on nerves. Examples are organophosphates (used in farming and as chemical weapons) and botulinum toxin (used in Botox®). In the case of organophosphates, the weakness and paralysis symptoms may be permanent.
Addison's disease
Addison's disease is a rare condition in which underactivity of the adrenal gland leads to a shortage of steroids in the blood and to abnormalities of the blood's salts. It tends to come on gradually. Patients can also develop unexpected tanning (pigmentation) of the skin. Weight loss is common but the symptoms are often vague. Muscle fatigue may be mild and is often an early symptom. The disease can be very difficult to spot and special tests are needed to confirm it.
Other rare hormonal causes of muscle weakness include acromegaly (excessive levels of a hormone called growth hormone), underactivity of the pituitary gland (hypopituitarism) and severe vitamin D deficiency.
I have muscle weakness - what will the doctor do?
A health professional will first need to know the following:
How the muscle weakness began and how long it has persisted for.
How the muscle weakness began and how long it has persisted for.
Whether it is getting worse, getting better or staying the same.
Whether it is getting worse, getting better or staying the same.
Whether there are other symptoms such as weight loss or whether there has been recent travel abroad.
Whether there are other symptoms such as weight loss or whether there has been recent travel abroad.
What medicines or other drugs have been taken and whether there are any muscle problems in the family.
What medicines or other drugs have been taken and whether there are any muscle problems in the family.
The pattern and severity of weakness, associated symptoms, medication use, and family history help to determine the cause of your weakness.
An examination will assess which muscles are affected and whether it is true or perceived muscle weakness. It will check to see whether the muscles are tender to touch (which suggests they are inflamed) or unusually 'fatigable'.
A doctor may need to test the central nervous system, including balance, gait and co-ordination. They may need to organise blood tests to look for abnormalities of hormones, salts and blood cells.
Depending on the results of these tests, a GP may also refer to a specialists for consideration of more tests including:
Nerve studies to make sure the nerves are conducting properly.
Nerve studies to make sure the nerves are conducting properly.
A muscle biopsy to see whether the muscles themselves show signs of inflammation or damage. A biopsy is a procedure where a small sample is taken to look at under the microscope.

There are many possible causes of muscle weakness. These range from common to rare, serious to minor, temporary to permanent. Fortunately, most cases of muscle weakness which lack obvious cause are reversible. It is very rare for muscle weakness to be the only sign of serious underlying disease.
A medical opinion should be sought for muscle weakness which has persisted for more than a few weeks, particularly if it is severe, localised, painful or has no obvious cause.

Treatment for left upper quadrant pain
Where is my left upper quadrant?
The left upper quadrant (LUQ) is a section of your tummy (abdomen). Look down at your tummy, and mentally divide the area from the bottom of your ribs down to your pubic hair into four quarters. The quarter on your left side closest to your ribs is your LUQ.

What organs are in my left upper quadrant?
The organs within your LUQ include:

What causes left upper quadrant pain?
Pain can come from any of the organs mentioned above, and these are the source for the most common causes. But the human body is never simple, so pain can also come from other areas of your body. This is called 'referred' pain. So this widens the possible causes of pain.
The following are some of the possibilities caused by the above organs. They are not in order of how common they are. Other causes are discussed later in this leaflet.
Problems with the spleen
Your spleen is just behind your stomach, under and behind the lower ribs on your left. Its main functions are to filter your blood, create new blood cells and store platelets. It is also a key part of your body's immune system. It may cause pain:
When it becomes enlarged, which can happen in certain blood-related cancers such as leukaemias and lymphomas. This tends to be a vague ache which may gradually get worse. An enlarged spleen can also occur during infections such as glandular fever.

If it bursts (ruptures) following an injury, such as in a road traffic accident or falling heavily onto handlebars of a bike. This causes a sudden severe pain shortly after significant injury to the tummy (abdomen).

Problems with your guts (stomach and bowels)
All sorts of common and uncommon problems to do with the upper and lower part of your guts can give you pain in this area. For example:
Stomach ulcers. The pain may feel like indigestion. Antacids may ease the pain for short periods of time. The pain can be severe and associated with vomiting. Some complications of stomach ulcers require emergency treatment. See the separate leaflet Stomach ulcer for more information.

Diverticulitis. This is inflammation of a pouch or pouches which people who have diverticular disease have in their guts. Usually the pain from diverticulitis is lower in the abdomen, but sometimes it can be felt higher up. It usually comes with a temperature (fever) and a change in your bowel habit.

Shingles
Sometimes people notice pain from shingles before the rash appears. The pain tends to be quite sharp or burning, and you may feel not quite right in yourself. A few days later a blistery rash appears. The LUQ is a common place for a shingles rash.
See the separate leaflet called Shingles (Herpes Zoster) for more information.
Kidney stones and infections
Problems with the kidney tend to give you pain more around the left-hand side of the LUQ, or in your back (loin), but the pain may spread and involve the front of the tummy (abdominal) area.
A kidney stone or infection can cause pain anywhere along your urinary tract. So this could be anywhere from the loin in your back, around to the front, the LUQ, or down to below your belly-button (umbilicus). It may severe, associated with a fever, pain when you wee, or you may pass urine more often than usual.
See the separate leaflets called Kidney infection (Pyelonephritis) and Kidney stones for more information.
Pain coming from the aorta
Your aorta is the main blood vessel of your body, carrying blood from your heart, and passing down the middle of your tummy, taking blood down to your legs and elsewhere. In some people this can swell, making it more vulnerable to leaking or bursting. This is called an aortic aneurysm.
If it develops a leak, you can get a tummy pain which you may also feel in your back. Rarely, the aorta can develop a tear in a weakened area of the lining of the aorta. This is called an aortic dissection. If the aorta bursts (ruptures), you will get a very severe pain in your tummy, back or chest and feel very unwell indeed. Any pain which is suspected to come from the aorta is a medical emergency and needs immediate treatment.
Pain coming from the pancreas
Your pancreas is in the middle of the upper part of your tummy. Chemicals (enzymes) made by cells in the pancreas pass into the guts to help digest food. The hormones insulin and glucagon are also made in the pancreas and help to regulate the blood sugar level.
It can become inflamed in the conditions acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis, causing upper tummy pain, usually with feeling sick (nausea) and/or being sick (vomiting). The pain is usually in the centre of the upper part of your tummy, but can be felt on the left. In acute pancreatitis there is usually also a fever and you may feel very unwell in yourself.
Cancers of the pancreas can also cause upper tummy pain although they can cause pain elsewhere such as the back, and, unfortunately, they often don't cause any symptoms until the person is very unwell with advanced cancer.
What are the other possible causes?
As well as the causes described above, many other conditions can cause LUQ pain. This list is not exhaustive.
Problems with your heart. The heart is located near the LUQ and as a result heart problems can sometimes present with LUQ pain. Conditions include a heart attack (myocardial infarction), angina or pericarditis. Call an ambulance immediately if you think you are having a heart attack.

What causes left upper quadrant pain in pregnancy?
Any of the above conditions can cause pain in the LUQ area, whether you are pregnant or not, so you should always get checked out. In early pregnancy it is important to consider ectopic pregnancy.
In pregnancy a common cause of discomfort is the pressure of the womb (uterus) pressing on other organs, and pressing them into the diaphragm. Problems with indigestion tend to be common in pregnancy, again at least partly due to the pressure on the stomach. Urinary tract infections are also more common in pregnancy.
What causes left upper quadrant pain in children?
In young children it is often quite difficult for them to show exactly where the pain is. If this is the case, the field of options widens to almost any cause of tummy ache. In children, common causes include:
Constipation.

Anxiety.

Gastroenteritis.

Are everybody's organs in the same place?
Very rarely, it is possible to have organs the opposite way round to the usual arrangement. This occurs in fewer than 1 in 10,000 people and is called situs inversus. If you were one of these few then all the causes which affect most people in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) could give you pains on the left.
Should I see a doctor for upper left abdominal pain?
Yes, if you have a pain which doesn't settle, you will probably need to see a health professional to help work out the cause. See a doctor urgently if:
Your pain is very severe.

You have recently lost weight without trying or have lost your appetite.

How is left upper quadrant pain diagnosed?
Your doctor will narrow the (enormous) field of possible diagnoses by talking to you and by examining you. They may be able to find the cause simply from doing so. For example, if they find the typical rash of shingles, you will need no further tests to find the cause.
The doctor will certainly need to feel your tummy (abdomen) in the area you have the pain, but may also need to examine other parts too, such as the rest of your tummy and your chest.

You may be asked to provide a sample of urine, to rule out kidney problems. You may need further tests, depending on what they think is causing the pain.

You may have to have blood tests to check the function of some of your organs or look for inflammation or possible infection. The doctor may ask for a pregnancy test to check you are not pregnant. You may be asked to provide a poo (stool) sample to look for infection in the stomach.
What are the next steps?
Next it will depend on what has already been found by examining you and talking with you. In some cases no further tests will be needed - if, for example, your doctor is confident you have indigestion, or constipation or shingles.
If a heart or lung problem is suspected, a heart tracing (electrocardiogram, or ECG) and/or chest X-ray might be required. If a problem with your stomach or upper bowel is suspected, you may need an examination with a tube with a camera put down into your stomach (an endoscopy).
A computerised tomography (CT) scan or an ultrasound scan may be helpful to look at your spleen, pancreas or kidneys. Further tests include other 'scopes' (such as a colonoscopy or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and other scans (such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan).
Nobody will need all these tests, and some people may not need any.
Treatment for left upper quadrant pain
This will depend on the cause of your pain. See the relevant leaflet for the condition with which you have been diagnosed.
What is the outlook?
Again this depends entirely on the cause of the pain. Your doctor should be able to give you an idea of the outlook (prognosis) once a diagnosis has become clear.

Lumps in the groin

Meets Patient’s editorial guidelines
Lumps in the groin are common. The commonest causes of lumps in the groin are groin (inguinal) hernias or swollen lymph nodes. Swollen lymph nodes in the groin may be caused by infection, or rarely by malignancy.
This leaflet gives a brief description of some of these causes and signposts to where more information on the individual conditions may be obtained.
In this article:

What do you mean by the groin?
What are the other possible causes of lumps in the groin?

When should I worry about a lump in my groin?

What are the most common causes of lumps in the groin?
Lumps can come from any structure in the groin, at any level from the skin on the outside, to the bone on the inside.
The most common causes of lumps in the groin are:
Skin infections
This includes infections such as boils or abscesses. Sometimes infections can develop around the hair follicles of pubic hair in this area, particularly if there is trauma from shaving or waxing or from rubbing on underwear. These lumps would be red or pink and sore. It hurts to touch them. They can vary from slightly sore pimples to very large abscesses.
Rarely, skin infections are due to an underlying medical condition. Hidradenitis suppurativa is one example. This is a long-term (chronic) skin condition, leading to painful and repeated lumps of pus (boils or abscesses).
Swollen lymph glands
Lymph glands are small lumps all around your body that are part of your immune system. They help you fight infection. Most people can't feel their lymph glands normally (sometimes, they can be felt in very slim people and in children), but if they become swollen you may feel them as a lump or lumps.
The groin is one part of your body where this can occur. The most common cause of swollen lymph glands is infection. This is your lymph glands just doing their job and fighting off the infection. Infections of the areas around the groin may cause the lymph nodes in the groin to swell - for example:
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Nappy rashes.
Nappy rashes.
Skin infections.
Skin infections.
Lymph glands can also swell up in response to infections which affect your whole system, such as glandular fever, chickenpox or flu. When lymph glands swell due to infection, they usually settle back to their normal size once the infection has gone.
Less commonly, lymph glands can swell due to a type of cancer. Cancers of the blood system, such as lymphoma (Hodgkin's lymphoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) or leukaemia, can cause swollen lymph glands. Cancers from other parts of the body can also spread to the lymph nodes, causing them to become bigger. Lymph glands which are swollen due to a type of cancer tend to be hard or solid, and do not go away as they do when swollen due to infection. They usually grow slowly, whereas glands swollen due to infection appear suddenly. People with lumps in the groin caused by cancer may also have other symptoms due to cancer, such as weight loss.
There are some other uncommon causes of swollen lymph nodes, such as:
Sarcoidosis.
Sarcoidosis.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
HIV and AIDS.
HIV and AIDS.
Hernias
A hernia occurs when an internal part of the body pushes through a weakness in the surrounding muscle or tissue wall. The groin is a common site for a hernia, and there are three types of hernia which can occur here. These are all types of bowel hernia, where bowel and other things inside the abdomen push out through a weakness in the abdominal wall. They are:
An inguinal hernia - more common in males.
An inguinal hernia - more common in males.
A femoral hernia - more common in females.
A femoral hernia - more common in females.
An incisional hernia - in the area of a previous operation scar or injury.
An incisional hernia - in the area of a previous operation scar or injury.
A hernia usually feels very soft and tends to go away when you lie down. If the tissue inside the hernia gets stuck, it can be hard and painful. If this occurs, you should see a doctor urgently.
What do you mean by the groin?
Your groin is the part just above the top of your legs, between the lowest part of your tummy and the top of your thigh. You have a groin on either side, around the crease where your leg joins the rest of your body. The groin is over the hip joint and contains several of the muscles of the leg.
There is a group of glands (lymph nodes) in the groin area, which normally cannot be felt. It also contains the inguinal canal on each side. The inguinal canal is a passageway for structures such as ligaments to pass between the tummy and the genital area.
See also the separate leaflet called Scrotal lumps, pain and swelling.
What are the other possible causes of lumps in the groin?
As well as those causes discussed above, there are also other causes of lumps in the groin, particularly lumps in the skin of the groin.
Skin lumps
Other than infection, there can be other skin conditions which can cause a lump in the groin. For example:
Fluid-filled lumps (cysts).
Fluid-filled lumps (cysts).
Warts. These are little skin lumps caused by a virus. Those around the genital area are called genital warts and may be sexually transmitted.

Tumours of the skin. These can be non-cancerous (such as papillomas) or cancerous. The groin is an uncommon place to get a skin cancer as it is not exposed to the sun as much as other parts of the body usually.

Fatty lumps
Lumps which come from the layer of fat beneath the skin are called lipomas. They are quite common and can occur anywhere in the body where there is a layer of fatty tissue. They feel quite soft and usually are harmless.
Enlarged blood vessels
Sometimes a vein or artery can become swollen, causing a lump. A swollen femoral artery in the groin is called a femoral aneurysm. Swollen veins are called varicose veins, and in the groin this is called a saphena varix.
Undescended testicle
While a baby boy is growing inside his mother's womb, his testicles (testes) gradually move from inside his tummy down to the bag or sac (the scrotum) under his penis. Sometimes one gets stuck along the way, and sometimes can be felt as a small lump in the groin.
Baby boys are checked at birth and at six weeks to be sure their testicles are in the scrotum. If the testicles have not moved down to the scrotum by the age of 6 months they may need an operation to move the testicles to where they should be.
What are the causes of pain in the groin?
Some of the causes of lumps above also cause pain, such as:
Skin infections
Skin infections
(Sometimes) hernias.
(Sometimes) hernias.
There are also several things that cause groin pain in this area without any lumps. The most common cause of this is a problem with your hip, in particular wear and tear (osteoarthritis of the hip). Another common cause is a pulled or torn muscle (a groin strain), usually from a sporting injury.
When should I worry about a lump in my groin?
Always see a doctor if you have an unexplained lump which does not settle on its own. See a doctor as soon as possible if your lump seems to be getting bigger. See a doctor urgently if:
The lump is very painful.
The lump is very painful.
You have pain in your tummy area along with being sick (vomiting) and/or not being able to poo.
You have pain in your tummy area along with being sick (vomiting) and/or not being able to poo.
You have a high temperature (fever) and feel unwell in yourself.
You have a high temperature (fever) and feel unwell in yourself.
Will I need any tests?
Your doctor will ask you some questions, and then examine the lump or lumps in your groin. Sometimes, this is all that's needed to make a diagnosis. For example, if you have a one-off boil or abscess you generally don't need any more tests.
In other cases, an ultrasound scan will be helpful. This can confirm the type of lump you have, and give more information about it. For example, if your doctor thinks your lump is a hernia, a scan can confirm this and determine which type of hernia it is and whether it needs treatment.
The scan shows what the lump is made out of. For example, if it shows fatty tissue, it suggests a non-cancerous fatty lump (lipoma). If you have an aneurysm, the scan will show a swollen artery. Undescended testicles can be seen on an ultrasound scan. A lump filled with fluid suggests a cyst, and so on.
Blood tests may also be helpful. These can help determine if swollen lymph glands are due to infection, and in some cases blood tests can help find the cause of the infection. In people who get repeated boils or abscesses a blood test to check for an underlying reason such as diabetes may be useful.
Occasionally it may be necessary to take a sample of the lump for further analysis. This is called a biopsy. A sample of the tissue inside the lump can be taken with a thin needle, or the whole lump removed. The sample is then examined under the microscope to find out the cause. This is helpful if some kind of cancerous lump or lymph gland is suspected.
What is the treatment for lumps in the groin?
This is different depending on the cause. There is no one single treatment for all lumps in the groin. Once your doctor finds the cause, he or she will advise on treatment options.
