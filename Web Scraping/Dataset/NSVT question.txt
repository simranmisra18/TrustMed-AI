Hello everyone, I’m looking for some opinions.
I’m a 38 year old female, and I started having increased heart palpitations and shortness of breath earlier this year, and brought it all up at my annual doctor visit this past July. I was actually just thinking thyroid issues, but they started looking into my heart. I was put on an extended Holter monitor for 2 weeks, and everything came back good, except this one finding:
”There was 1 episode of NSVT lasting 3 beats at 118 bpm.”
My regular doctor got the results and called back to say everything was fine, and no palpitations were found. Family members are encouraging me to look into it further with a heart specialist, however. And I did a search on the finding, and it does leave me wondering if maybe I should have it looked into further.
Any thoughts or opinions would be greatly appreciated!
