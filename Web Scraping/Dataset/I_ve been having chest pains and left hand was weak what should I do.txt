Hello there, I’ve had a problem with chest pains past 2 weeks but then a doctor gave me a medication, isosorbide dinitrate,and also aspirin to take orally after sometime,it makes me feel headaches so painful and severe,
and warmth sensations on my skin, and dizziness, and then I become so weak, it has been 4days since I take these medication so I continue use or what do I do?

I think you need an ECG and blood work. if it is angina you may also benefit from further testing like angiography. If you do have a blockage, knowing how bad it is may change treatment.
