I was picking up something from the floor and as I turned around to put it back down, I felt a weird, constricted (knot) feeling in my upper tummy and chest. It felt strange in my throat too. I placed my fingers on the carotid artery and this is what I felt: beat, beat, beat, two quick beats, then beat, beat, beat, two quick beats, then beat, beat, beat, two quick beats, then normal beats from then on. I don’t think the heart rate went over 80 the entire episode. I was so shook up, I was shaking and crying. I had told Steve I would make us Chef salads, I did, but I was so befuddled I had a difficult time making them. I tried to eat, but I couldn’t finish because I felt full and bloated, plus it was huge, I can’t believe Steve ate all his and the little that was left of mine. I am calmer now, but my tummy feels fluttery and I am on the alert for more skipped heart beats. What a way to start 2024
I hate that weird “knot” feeling in my upper tummy when they start, and the shortness of breath. I feel that feeling the most when I am talking or twisting or bending a certain way.
I will also add that lately, if anything upsets me, even a little bit or I feel anxious, the skipped heart beats usually start, they weren’t this “hair trigger” in the past.
Happy New Year anyway, I hope y’all have a better, skip free day. Hugs.
