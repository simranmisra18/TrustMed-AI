Hi just been diagnosed with Angina after tests , got me feeling low I will admit. I am 68yr old overweight woman ex-smoker non drinker. I am on low dose of Ramipril .1.25 and 10mg Alodipine ,75mg aspirin .1 Glyceryl trinitrate spray if needed. So many friends say this is very common and treatable and not to worry. Do wish like them I could be optimistic but I am not at the moment.

Hi, l know how you feel, l was diagnosed in August with unstable angina and have just been in hospital again regarding this, l am fed up. It’s hitting me mentally as when I’m in hospital they run tests that come back negative. Always tell me to go back if l get severe pains. It’s been a bad year, smashed my knee in on a hike, been diagnosed with a hole in the heart and two holes in each valve.
