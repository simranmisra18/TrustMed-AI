i had my ablation for SVT today, and it was so easy! I was worried sick fir nothing. I didn't sense or feel a thing under the anesthesia, and my doctor was able to trigger an SVT episode and fix it. The procedure took about 2 hours, and i was in the hospital for 10. I'm not feeling any pain at all, and I'm cleared to drive again in 2 days. I had the AVNRT type of SVT. I just want to tell you that if you've been recommended an ablation and are scared, don't be! I'm happy to answer any questions about it.

Glad that you’re doing well! Out of curiosity…how long after you were diagnosed with SVT did you get the ablation? Did you know what type of SVT you had BEFORE the ablation, or did you only find out during the EP study?

Thank you! I was formally diagnosed with SVT 2 years ago. My cardiologist recommended an ablation then, but i was so scared that i tried medication, no caffeine, no alcohol first. Nothing worked and I went to the ER 10 times in 2 years with a heart rate of over 200. I finally realized that ablation was my only shot of fixing the problem.
I didn’t know that i had AVNRT until today!

Congratulations!!!
It seems that the highest success is with AVNRT
Sadly, I have AT. The success rate is much lower

Just to update, three months down the line, everything is going great! Ive had no more episodes of SVT. Sometimes, my heart will flutter for a few seconds, but it stops right away. I’m so glad I had the ablation and that i have my life back!
