What is plantar fasciitis?
Plantar fasciitis means inflammation of your plantar fascia. The plantar fascia is a band of tissue that connects your heel bone to the base of your toes.
It is a condition that affects around one in ten people at some point in their lives. It's also known as 'jogger's heel' - although you don't have to be a runner to develop it. Luckily, it usually gets better in time, but treatment may speed up your recovery.
So, what can you do about it? Useful treatment includes rest, good footwear, heel pads, painkillers and exercises. A steroid injection or other treatments may be used in more severe cases.
What is the plantar fascia?
Your plantar fascia is a strong band of tissue (like a ligament) that stretches from your heel (calcaneum) to your middle foot bones. It supports the arch of your foot and also acts as a shock absorber in your foot.
What causes plantar fasciitis?
Repeated small injuries to the fascia (with or without inflammation) are thought to be the cause of plantar fasciitis. The injury is usually near to where the plantar fascia attaches to your heel bone.
What makes it likely for someone to develop plantar fasciitis?
You are more likely to injure your plantar fascia in certain situations. For example:
If you are on your feet for a lot of the time, or if you do lots of walking, running, standing, etc, when you are not used to it or have previously had a more sedentary lifestyle.

Plantar fasciitis may be confused with 'policeman's heel' but they are different. Policeman's heel is called plantar calcaneal bursitis - inflammation of the sack of fluid (bursa) under the heel bone (calcaneum). This is not as common as plantar fasciitis.
Often there is no apparent cause for plantar fasciitis, particularly in older people. A common wrong belief is that the pain is due to a bony growth, or 'spur', coming from the heel bone. Many people have a bony heel spur but not everyone with this develops plantar fasciitis.
How common is plantar fasciitis?
Plantar fasciitis is common. Around 4-7% of people will develop plantar fasciitis at some time in their lives and it accounts for 11-15% of all foot problems that require professional treatment.
It is most common in people between the ages of 40 to 60 years. However, it can occur at any age. It is slightly more common in women than in men. It is also common in athletes.
Plantar fasciitis symptoms
Pain is one of the main symptoms of plantar fasciitis. The inflamed plantar fascia can hurt when you put pressure on the foot while walking. This pain can be anywhere on the underside of your heel. However, commonly, one spot is found as the main source of pain. This is often about 4 cm forward from your heel and may be tender to touch.
The pain is often worst when you take your first steps on getting up in the morning, or after long-term rest where no weight is placed on your foot. Often, it's described as a stabbing or aching pain. Gentle exercise may ease things a little as the day goes by.
However, a long walk or being on your feet for long periods often makes the pain worse. Resting your foot usually eases the pain - this can be very frustrating for people who are trying to improve their fitness levels by taking up running!
Sudden stretching of the bottom of your foot may make the pain worse - for example, walking up stairs or on tiptoes. You may limp because of pain. Some people have plantar fasciitis in both feet at the same time.
The anatomy of your foot
Spare a thought for your feet - they have to bear the weight of your whole body. There are many bones in each foot (see the images below) and these can briefly be divided into three parts:
Forefoot: made up of the toes (phalanges) and the five long bones (metatarsals). These are named from first to fifth. The first metatarsal bone is the largest and is the bone that joins to your big toe. Each toe has three phalanges, except the big toe which has only two. This means there are three joints in the toes (two in the big toe).

What is the Achilles tendon?
Your Achilles tendon is an important part of your leg. It is found just behind and above your heel. It joins your heel bone (calcaneum) to your calf muscles. The function of your Achilles tendon is to help in bending your foot downwards at the ankle, as you do when you're pointing your toes. (This movement is called plantar flexion.)

Foot care
Morton's neuroma is a condition that affects one of the nerves that run between the long bones (metatarsals) in the foot. The exact cause is not certain. Symptoms include pain, burning, numbness and tingling between two of the toes of the foot. About a third of cases resolve withd simple treatments including modification of footwear. Sometimes surgery is needed for long-standing (chronic) symptoms.
by Dr Philippa Vincent, MRCGP
There are also many other tendons, as well as muscles and ligaments, within your foot. The bones, ligaments and tendons within your foot form the foot arches. These arches are called the longitudinal and transverse arches. It is your foot arches that allow your foot to hold up the weight of your body. Nerves provide sensation to the skin of your foot.

How is plantar fasciitis diagnosed?
Your doctor can usually diagnose plantar fasciitis just by talking to you and examining your feet. Rarely, tests are needed if the diagnosis is uncertain or to rule out other possible causes of heel pain.
These can include X-rays of the heel (usually done to rule out other causes of pain rather than to diagnose plantar fasciitis) or an ultrasound scan of the fascia. An ultrasound scan usually shows thickening and swelling of the fascia in plantar fasciitis.
How long does plantar fasciitis take to heal?
Plantar fasciitis typically lasts between 6 to 12 months with the aid of the treatments like stretching exercises, which are covered below.
How to ease plantar fasciitis
Usually, the pain will ease in time. 'Fascia' tissue, like 'ligament' tissue, heals quite slowly. It may take several months or more to go. However, there is a variety of treatments that may help to speed recovery. A combination of different treatments may help. These vary from rest and simple exercises (most common) to surgery (rare).
Collectively, these initial treatments are known as 'conservative' treatments for plantar fasciitis:
Rest your foot
This should be done as much as possible. Avoid running, excess walking or standing, and undue stretching of your sole. Gentle walking and exercises described below are encouraged.
Footwear
Do not walk barefoot on hard surfaces. Choose shoes with cushioned heels and good arch support. A laced sports shoe rather than an open sandal is probably best. Avoid old or worn shoes that may not give a good cushion to your heel.
Heel pads and arch supports
You can buy various pads and shoe inserts to cushion the heel and support the arch of your foot. These work best if you put them in your shoes at all times, particularly if you have quite a high arch. The aim is to raise your heel by about 1 cm.
If your heel is tender, cut a small hole in the heel pad at the site of the tender spot. This means that the tender part of your heel will not touch anything inside your shoe. Place the inserts/pads in both shoes, even if you only have pain in one foot. A podiatrist may be able to help with specialist inserts like night splints.
Pain relief
Painkillers such as paracetamol will often ease the pain. Sometimes anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen are useful. These are painkillers but also reduce inflammation and may work better than ordinary painkillers. Some people find that rubbing a cream or gel that contains an anti-inflammatory medicine on to their heel is helpful.
An ice pack (such as a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) held to your foot for 15-20 minutes may also help to relieve pain.
Exercises
Regular, gentle stretching of your Achilles tendon and plantar fascia may help to ease your symptoms. This is because most people with plantar fasciitis have a slight tightness of their Achilles tendon. If this is the case, it tends to pull at the back of your heel and has a knock-on effect of keeping your plantar fascia tight.
Also, when you are asleep overnight, your plantar fascia tends to tighten up (which is why it is usually most painful first thing in the morning). The aim of these exercises is to loosen up the tendons and fascia gently above and below your heel. Your doctor may refer you to a physiotherapist for exercise guidance.
Watch our physiotherapist taking you through all the exercises for plantar fasciitis in our video.
Exercises (done with or without shoes on) to help treat plantar fasciitis
Choosing the correct footwear can help to reduce pain
Stand about 40 cm away from a wall and put both hands on the wall at shoulder height, feet slightly apart, with one foot in front of the other. Bend your front knee but keep your back knee straight and lean in towards the wall to stretch. You should feel your calf muscle tighten. Keep this position for several seconds, then relax. Do this about 10 times then switch to the other leg. Now repeat the same exercise for both legs but this time, bring your back foot forward slightly so that your back knee is also slightly bent. Lean against the wall as before, keep the position, relax and then repeat 10 times before switching to the other leg. Repeat this routine twice a day.

Stand on the bottom step of some stairs with your legs slightly apart and with your heels just off the end of the step. Hold the stair rails for support. Lower your heels, keeping your knees straight. Again you should feel the stretch in your calves. Keep the position for 20-60 seconds, then relax. Repeat six times. Try to do this exercise twice a day.

For this exercise you need an object such as a rolling pin or a drinks can. Whilst sitting in a chair, put the object under the arch of your foot. Roll the arch of your foot over the object in different directions. Perform this exercise for a few minutes for each foot at least twice a day. This exercise is best done without shoes on.

How is plantar fasciitis treated?
If the above treatments are not helping to relieve your symptoms, or if you are someone such as an athlete who needs a quick recovery, other treatments are available. There is no one specific treatment for plantar fasciitis that appears to stand out as the best.
Steroid injections
A steroid (cortisone) injection is sometimes tried if your pain remains bad despite the above 'conservative' measures. It may relieve the pain in some people for several weeks but does not always cure the problem.
It is not always successful and may be sore to have done. Steroids work by reducing inflammation. Steroid injections do carry some risks, including (rarely) tearing (rupture) of the plantar fascia and for this reason they are less commonly done in the community these days - GPs will often refer to a service that can do the injection under ultrasound guidance.
Extracorporeal shock-wave therapy
In extracorporeal shock-wave therapy, a machine is used to deliver high-energy sound waves through your skin to the painful area on your foot. It is not known exactly how it works but it is thought that it might stimulate healing of your plantar fascia. One or more sessions of treatment may be needed.
This procedure appears to be safe but it is uncertain how well it works. This is mostly because of a lack of large, well-designed clinical trials. You should have a full discussion with your doctor about the potential benefits and risks.
In studies, most people who have had extracorporeal shock-wave therapy have little in the way of problems. However, possible problems that can occur include pain during treatment, skin reddening, and swelling of your foot or bruising.
Another theoretical problem could include the condition becoming worse because of rupture of your plantar fascia or damage to the tissues in your foot. More research into extracorporeal shock-wave therapy for plantar fasciitis is needed.
Other treatments for plantar fasciitis
Various studies and trials have been carried out looking at other possible treatments for plantar fasciitis. Such treatments include injection with botulinum toxin and treatment of the plantar fascia with radiotherapy. These treatments may not be widely available.
Some people benefit from wearing a special splint overnight to keep their Achilles tendon and plantar fascia slightly stretched. The aim is to prevent the plantar fascia from tightening up overnight. In very difficult cases, sometimes a plaster cast or a removable walking brace is put on the lower leg.
This provides rest, protection, cushioning and slight stretching of the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon. However, the evidence for the use of splint treatment of plantar fasciitis is limited.
Can you have surgery for plantar fasciitis?
This may be considered in very difficult cases. Surgery is usually only advised if your pain has not eased after 12 months despite other treatments. The operation involves separating your plantar fascia from where it connects to the bone; this is called a plantar fascia release.
It may also involve removal of a spur on the heel bone (calcaneum) if one is present. Surgery is not always successful. It can cause complications in some people so it should be considered as a last resort. Complications may include infection, increased pain, injury to nearby nerves, or rupture of the plantar fascia.
What is the outlook (prognosis)?
Most people have completely recovered from an episode of plantar fasciitis within a year. However, some of the treatments described above may help to speed up your recovery.
How to prevent plantar fasciitis
There are certain things that you can do to try to prevent plantar fasciitis, especially if you have had it before. These include:
Regularly changing training shoes used for running or walking.

Where are the metatarsal bones?
The metatarsal bones are the long slim bones which run the length of the foot to the base of the toes. They are the most commonly broken (fractured) bones in the foot. There are five metatarsal bones in each foot.
For more information on foot anatomy, see the separate leaflet called Plantar fasciitis (Heel and foot pain).
Heel and foot bones
A metatarsal fracture is a break in one of the five long bones which form the middle part of the foot.
Are there different types of metatarsal fracture?
Metatarsal fractures (broken metatarsal bones) can be acute, or caused immediately by injury. They can also occur following recurrent trauma over a longer period of time, when they are called stress fractures.
Acute metatarsal fracture
An acute metatarsal fracture is usually caused by a sudden forceful injury to the foot, such as dropping a heavy object on to the foot, kicking against a hard object when tripping, falling or from a sporting injury.
A metatarsal break may be open or closed, and displaced or not displaced:
Open or closed: A closed fracture is far more common - this is where the bone is broken but the skin and other tissues remain intact over and around the broken bone. An open fracture is one where the skin is broken over the fracture. This is a more serious type of fracture, with more damage to the soft tissues around it making treatment and healing more complicated. There is also a route of possible infection from the outside into the broken metatarsal bone. Specialist assessment is always needed for an open fracture.

There is also a route of possible infection from the outside into the broken metatarsal bone. Specialist assessment is always needed for an open fracture.
Displaced or not displaced: A non-displaced fractured metatarsal is much more common than displaced. A displaced fracture is one where, following the break, the bones have slipped out of line. A displaced fracture needs specialist care, as the bones will need to be properly lined up and stabilised. This may involve an anaesthetic and some kind of metal pinning or plating to the bones.

A displaced fracture needs specialist care, as the bones will need to be properly lined up and stabilised. This may involve an anaesthetic and some kind of metal pinning or plating to the bones.
5th metatarsal fracture
The fifth metatarsal bone is the most common metatarsal bone to be fractured in sudden (acute) injury to the foot. It may be broken at various points along its length, depending on the mechanism of injury. The other metatarsal bones can also be broken. The first, second and fifth metatarsals are the most commonly injured in sport. Several well-known footballers have had metatarsal fractures in recent years.
Stress fracture
A stress metatarsal fracture occurs when the metatarsal bone fractures due to repetitive stress. In this instance, the metatarsal break is usually only partway through the bone. There may be a single split in the bone, or multiple small splits. Because the fracture does not affect the full thickness of the broken metatarsal bone, stress fractures are not generally displaced. However, several small stress fractures can develop around the same area.
What causes metatarsal fractures?
Acute metatarsal fractures
These are usually caused by a direct injury to the foot. This may happen, for example, through someone stepping on or kicking the foot, by dropping something on to the foot or by falling on to the foot.

Twisting of the foot or the ankle can also cause fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal. In this injury, the twisting mechanism pulls on a strong ligament that attaches to the base of the fifth metatarsal which then pulls off a fragment of bone.

The shaft of the metatarsal can be injured due to twisting the foot on landing from a jump. This is a common problem in ballet dancers.

People's choices and needs for running shoes vary. Advice from a specialist should be sought before choosing a more unusual shoe type such as barefoot shoes or corrective shoes. For example, there is a particular technique for barefoot running. It's advised to break in new running shoes gradually - many injuries result from a sudden change in running shoes. Ballet dancers and gymnasts are also prone to broken metatarsal bones.
Abnormalities of the structure of the foot, and abnormalities of the bones and joints, such as rheumatoid arthritis or 'thinning' of the bones (osteoporosis), can make stress fractures more likely.
They can also occur in people who have lost nerve sensation in their feet due to neurological problems - for example, diabetes that has affected the feet.
Does osteoporosis cause metatarsal fractures?
Metatarsal fractures occur more easily if the metatarsal bones are weakened due to 'thinning' of the bones (osteoporosis).

See the separate leaflet called Osteoporosis for more detail.
Does ageing make metatarsal fractures more likely?
Most metatarsal fractures occur in younger people, as they are more likely to be involved in the kinds of sports and activities that are higher risk. However, as we become older the 'springiness' and padding of our feet tend to reduce. This means that our feet absorb impact less well and it is easier to fracture bones. Supportive footwear will make this much less likely.
See the separate leaflet called Ageing feet for more detail.
What are the symptoms of a metatarsal fracture?
Acute metatarsal fracture
There is usually immediate pain and tenderness around the area of the fracture.

The pain is often described as 'pinpoint pain' as it is usually well localised at the site of impact to the bone.

There may be some swelling but there is usually no bruising.
People who have stress fractures may continue to walk for some time. Eventually this becomes increasingly painful, as the splits in the bone tend to worsen and the bone itself starts to react and become inflamed, and it can become impossible to weight bear. A metatarsal stress fracture can progress to become a full-thickness fracture.
Will the pain increase?
Metatarsal stress fractures can begin as very small injuries which do not cause severe pain. However, if the bone continues to experience stress, the crack will often deepen and widen, becoming gradually more painful. Eventually, in the worst case scenario, the stress fracture may progress to become a full fracture.
In an acute fracture, if the bone continues to experience stress, the pain will increase further as the broken ends of bone will start to rub slightly against one another and the area will become inflamed. In the worst case scenario the fracture may become displaced.
Do I need any investigations?
A healthcare worker is likely to suggest an X-ray of the foot if they suspect a metatarsal fracture.
Acute metatarsal fractures
Most can be seen easily on X-ray. Initially doctors can see the crack in the bone, and after a few days they can also see irregularities in the bone as it starts to heal and remodel itself.

Do I need to see a doctor if I suspect metatarsal fracture?
Medical advice should be sought if a metatarsal fracture or other broken bone in the foot is suspected. This is usually best provided in an Urgent Care Centre or the equivalent as x-rays will be available at the time.

The basic principles of treating metatarsal fractures are as follows.
Simple painkillers
Painkillers such as paracetamol and anti-inflammatory tablets such as ibuprofen which may help to relieve pain.
Ice
Applying ice to the foot can also be helpful as pain relief and to reduce inflammation. Ice should be applied as soon as possible after injury, for 10-30 minutes. (Less than 10 minutes has little effect. More than 30 minutes may damage the skin.) Make an ice pack by wrapping ice cubes in a plastic bag or towel, or by using a bag of frozen peas.
Do not put ice directly next to skin, as it may cause ice burn. Gently press the ice pack on to the injured part. The cold is thought to reduce blood flow to the damaged area. This may limit pain, inflammation and bruising.
Some doctors recommend re-applying for 15 minutes every two hours (during daytime) for the first 48-72 hours. Do not leave ice on while asleep.
See the separate leaflet called Ice and heat therapy for pain relief for more details.
Rest and elevate
Elevation initially aims to limit and reduce any swelling. For example, the foot should be kept up on a chair to at least hip level when sitting or on a pillow when in bed. Sometimes rest is the only treatment that is needed, even in traumatic fracture.
Stop stressing the foot
With a stress fracture, it is important to avoid the activity that caused it.
Immobilisation
Some fractures need support to help healing. For example, a supportive elastic tubular bandage with a supportive, rigid shoe or boot may be advised. If needed, special shoes are available to help to immobilise the fracture and support the foot enable walking.
Progressive weight bearing on the foot can then follow as pain allows. Other fractures may need treatment with a below-the-knee plaster cast.
Surgery
Very occasionally, surgery may be necessary to re-align any part of the bone that has moved out of position. Surgery is not needed for stress fractures.
Follow-up care
Physiotherapy and a gradual return to exercise are a part of good follow-up care.
How long does a metatarsal fracture take to heal?
Acute metatarsal fractures
These generally take around six to eight weeks to heal. However, it may be longer than this before a sportsperson is fully back in action.
Stress fractures
These will normally heal without any complications and, in time, people are able to return to their previous activities fully. Return to normal activities is advised when they can be performed without pain. This will typically take six to twelve weeks.
However, when starting exercising again, it is important to gradually build up the activity levels. A sudden return to high-intensity exercise after a break may cause a repeat or a new stress fracture or other injury.
What if the pain gets worse?
If the pain gets worse then medical advice should be sought. The expected pattern of healing, in bony injuries of any kind, is that they should gradually hurt less as healing occurs, and any gradual worsening of pain should be reviewed.
If foot pain is increasing over time then activity may be making an existing problem worse. In the case of a stress fracture this may mean progression to an acute fracture.
In the case of an acute fracture it may be worsening displacement of the bones and preventing the two ends of the bone from knitting together.
What are the complications of metatarsal fractures?
If properly treated then metatarsal fractures should heal without any long-term consequences. If not recognised and treated then some of these problems can occur:
A metatarsal stress fracture can become gradually worse if repeated stress to the bone continues. It can eventually become a full-thickness metatarsal fracture.

Meets Patient’s editorial guidelines
Gout causes attacks of pain and swelling in one or more joints. An anti-inflammatory painkiller usually eases an attack quickly. Lifestyle factors may reduce the risk of having gout attacks. These include losing weight (if overweight), eating a healthy diet and not drinking a lot of alcohol or sugar-sweetened soft drinks. If gout attacks are frequent then taking a medicine (such as allopurinol) each day can prevent them.

What is gout?
Gout causes attacks of painful inflammation in one or more joints. It is a type of arthritis (although it is very different to the more common rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis). The pain of a gout attack can be severe.
What causes gout?
Gout is caused by a chemical in the blood, called uric acid (urate). Uric acid is usually harmless and is made in the body. Most is passed out with the urine and some from the gut with the stools.
In people with gout the levels of uric acid in the blood builds up. From time to time the level may become too high and tiny grit-like crystals of uric acid may form. The urate crystals typically collect in a joint. The crystals irritate the tissues in the joint to cause inflammation, swelling and pain - this is a gout attack.
Note: some people have a high level of uric acid but do not form uric acid crystals or have gout. Also, rarely, some people with a normal level of uric acid have gout attacks. However, as a rule, the higher the level of uric acid, the greater the chance of developing gout.
Why does uric acid build up?
Normally, there is a fine balance between the amount of uric acid that you make and the amount that you pass out in the urine and stools. This keeps the level of uric acid in the blood in check. However, in most people with gout, their kidneys do not pass out enough uric acid and the blood level may rise. They are said to be 'under-excreters' of uric acid. Their kidneys usually work otherwise normally.
Eating a normal balanced diet should not have much effect on the uric acid level. However, in some people, the build-up of uric acid may due to other factors - for example:
Drinking too much alcohol can cause uric acid to build up.
Drinking too much alcohol can cause uric acid to build up.
Some medicines may raise the level of uric acid - for example, 'water' tablets (diuretics) such as bendroflumethiazide, aspirin, and some chemotherapy medicines.

Bones, joints and muscles
Septic arthritis is an infection in a joint. Symptoms include pain and tenderness over a joint, pain on moving the joint, and feeling unwell. It is an uncommon infection but serious. Urgent treatment is needed. This includes antibiotic medicines and drainage of infected fluid from the joint to prevent permanent joint damage.

How common is gout?
Gout affects about 1 in 50 adults. Men are more commonly affected than women. A first attack of gout typically develops in middle age but it sometimes occurs in younger people. However it is rare in people aged under 20 years.
What are the symptoms of gout?
Gout usually occurs in attacks. An attack typically develops quickly over a few hours. It usually causes severe pain in one joint. The base of the big toe is the most commonly affected joint. Walking can be very painful and even the weight of bedclothes can hurt.
However, any joint can be affected including the middle of the foot, or the ankle, knee, hand, wrist, or elbow. Sometimes two or more joints are affected. Affected joints usually swell and the nearby skin may look red and inflamed. If left untreated, a gout attack may last several days but usually goes completely within 10 days. Less severe attacks can occur which may be mistaken at first for other forms of arthritis. Weeks, months or even years may go by between attacks. Some people only ever have one attack.
Is gout serious?
A gout attack can be very painful. However, other effects from gout are uncommon. Joint damage may occur if you have repeated attacks. In a few people, uric acid (urate) crystals form kidney stones or may cause some kidney damage. Sometimes the crystals in the joints form bumps (tophi) under the skin. These are usually harmless and painless but sometimes form in awkward places such as at the end of fingers. Tophi occasionally become infected.
How is gout diagnosed?
Gout is usually diagnosed if you have the typical gout symptoms and a raised blood level of uric acid (urate). To make the diagnosis blood urate level is 360 micromol/litre or more. If the urate level is below 360 micromol/litre during a flare and gout is strongly suspected, the serum urate level measurement should be repeated at least 2 weeks after the flare has settled.
If there is doubt about the cause of the pain and swelling, your doctor may take some fluid out of a swollen joint. This is done with a needle and syringe. The fluid is looked at under the microscope. Crystals of uric acid can be seen in the fluid to confirm the diagnosis of gout.
How is gout treated?
General measures
If you are able to, raise the affected limb (usually a leg) to help reduce the swelling. The easiest way to raise your leg is to recline on a sofa with your leg up on a cushion. An ice pack (or a pack of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) held against the inflamed joint may ease the pain until the gout treatment medicines (below) start to work:
Wrap the ice pack (or peas) in a towel to avoid direct skin contact and ice burn.

Repeat as often as required BUT make sure the temperature of the affected part has returned to normal before applying again.
Repeat as often as required BUT make sure the temperature of the affected part has returned to normal before applying again.
Anti-inflammatory painkillers
A short course of an anti-inflammatory painkiller will quickly ease most gout attacks (within 12-24 hours). There are several types and brands, such as diclofenac, indometacin and naproxen. Your doctor will prescribe one. Many people with gout like to have a supply of tablets on standby in the home just in case an attack occurs. They are usually needed only for a few days until the inflammation and pain go.
Most people can take short courses of anti-inflammatory painkillers without any problem, although side-effects occur in some people:
Bleeding from the stomach is the most serious possible side-effect. This is more of a risk if you are aged over 65, or have had a duodenal or stomach ulcer. Stop the anti-inflammatory tablets and see a doctor if you develop indigestion, have upper tummy (abdominal) pain, pass black stools (black faeces), or if you are sick (vomit) or pass blood. Your doctor may prescribe a tablet (a proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole to protect your stomach while you are taking the anti-inflammatory medicine. Read the leaflet that comes with the tablets for a list of other possible side-effects.

Some people taking certain other medicines should not take anti-inflammatory painkillers. This is because of a possible risk of the two medicines interacting. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medication, before taking anti-inflammatory painkillers.
Some people taking certain other medicines should not take anti-inflammatory painkillers. This is because of a possible risk of the two medicines interacting. Therefore, check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medication, before taking anti-inflammatory painkillers.
Also, don't take more than one anti-inflammatory painkiller at a time unless specified by a doctor. For example, some people take low-dose aspirin every day (which is classed as an anti-inflammatory medicine) to prevent blood clots. Aspirin plus another anti-inflammatory medicine increases the risk of bleeding from the stomach.
Therefore, if you are already taking aspirin and develop gout, you need to discuss the options with your doctor. For example, your doctor may advise that you take a proton pump inhibitor to protect your stomach if you need to take aspirin and another anti-inflammatory medicine. Remember - some painkillers that you can buy from pharmacies contain aspirin.
Other treatments
Colchicine is an alternative medicine that eases gout attacks. It is usually only used if you have problems or side-effects with anti-inflammatory painkillers.
Steroid tablets or steroid injections can also reduce the pain and inflammation. They are another alternative if there are problems or side-effects with anti-inflammatory painkillers and colchicine.
Canakinumab is another option that has recently been introduced.
How to prevent gout
Lifestyle measures and medicines can help to prevent gout attacks.
Lifestyle suggestions
If you are overweight, try to lose some weight. This can help to reduce the uric acid levels (urate). However, do not use diets that increase uric acid levels, such as high-protein diets or starvation diets.

If you drink a lot of alcohol then it may help if you reduce the amount that you drink. You do not need to stop drinking alcohol altogether but cutting down may help if you drink a lot. In particular, avoid binge drinking. Men and women should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol per week, no more than three units in any one day and have at least two alcohol-free days a week.

Allopurinol
Allopurinol is a commonly used medicine to prevent gout attacks. Allopurinol does not have any effect during a gout attack and it is not a painkiller. It works by lowering the level of uric acid in the blood. It takes 2-3 months to become fully effective. You need to take it every day to keep the uric acid level normal to prevent gout attacks.
As a general rule, regular allopurinol may be advised by your doctor if you:
Have had two or more attacks of gout within a year.

Have one or more tophi (described above).

Have had a gout attack and are taking long-term medication that can cause gout.
When you first take allopurinol, it can sometimes cause a gout attack. For this reason it is not normally started during a gout attack. It is best to start it about 3-4 weeks after an attack has settled. Also, an anti-inflammatory painkiller is often prescribed for the first 2-3 months after you start allopurinol, just in case the allopurinol causes a gout attack. Once the level of uric acid has been brought down, taking allopurinol each day usually works well to prevent gout attacks.
The dose of allopurinol needed varies from person to person. Treatment is usually started with a low dose. A blood test is often done after a month or so to check that the level of uric acid has come down. If not, the dose may need to be increased. Most people take about 100-300 mg each day to stop gout attacks.
If a gout attack occurs while you are taking allopurinol, you can still take an anti-inflammatory painkiller to relieve the pain. However, this may indicate that you need an increased dose of allopurinol. Side-effects are uncommon with allopurinol. Read the information that comes with the packet of tablets for details about possible side-effects. If side-effects do occur, other medicines with a similar action are sometimes prescribed. For example, a medicine called febuxostat may be an option if you cannot take allopurinol for medical reasons or due to side-effects.
Other medicines used to prevent gout attacks
Febuxostat is effective in preventing gout attacks by keeping uric acid levels low but it has side-effects and is reserved for people who have problems with allopurinol. Other options include probenecid, benzbromarone, low-dose steroids, colchicine and anti-inflammatory medicines.
What is the outcome (prognosis)?
A sudden-onset (acute) attack of gout usually resolves within 1 to 2 weeks. About 2 in every 3 people who have one acute attack will have another acute attack within the following year. Repeated acute attacks and long-lasting (chronic) gout lead to progressive damage of the joint and therefore to persistent pain and disability.

Meets Patient’s editorial guidelines
Ingrown toenails are a common condition which may cause discomfort or become infected. You might see the condition described as 'ingrowing' but both terms mean the same thing. Various treatments can be given by a doctor or nurse, or a person qualified to diagnose and treat foot disorders (a podiatrist). See a doctor if you have symptoms of infection around the nail, particularly if you have diabetes, a poor immune system or any other foot problem.

How to prevent ingrown toenails
What is an ingrown toenail?
The nail becomes ingrown when the side of the nail cuts into the skin next to the nail. This can become painful. The skin next to the nail may also become infected or inflamed.
Any toe can be affected but it is usually the big toe. Ingrowing toenails are a common problem, especially in teenagers and young adults. However, ingrown toenails can also occur in babies or toddlers.
What causes ingrown toenails?
An ingrown toenail is usually caused by a sharp spike of nail growing into the skin beside it.
This can happen as a result of various factors, including:
Not trimming your nails correctly.

Early on, the skin around the ingrown nail may become reddened and feels slightly tender. If it progresses and becomes infected, it may become more swollen, red and painful.
If the infection gets worse, there may be some fluid (pus) oozing from around the nail. Ingrown toenail pus is usually yellow or green. The nail will become even more painful and there may be an overgrowth of skin around it.
Treating an ingrown toenail at home
If the ingrowing part of the nail is small, a non-surgical fix may be possible. It may be prevented from becoming worse, and sometimes cured, by the following. This treatment may be given by a podiatrist or other healthcare professional, or you may be shown how to do it yourself.
Soak the toe in water for 10 minutes to soften the folds of skin around the affected nail.

As the end of the nail grows forward, push a tiny piece of cotton wool or dental floss under it to help the nail grow over the skin and not grow into it. Change the cotton wool or dental floss each time you soak your foot.

Do not cut the nail but allow it to grow forward until it is clear of the end of the toe. Then cut straight across the nail, and not rounded off at the end.

There are variations on this method - the principle is to keep the skin from growing over the edge of the nail.
Infected ingrown toenails
If the nail fold becomes infected, symptoms of infection are increasing pain, swelling and redness near the ingrown nail, and yellow or green pus near the nail or under the nearby skin. If the infection is getting worse, you may have a throbbing pain, redness spreading over the toe, or a high temperature (fever).
Antibiotics may be needed to treat infection. It can also help to soak your feet in warm salty water, then carefully dry your feet.
Do I need to contact a doctor for an ingrown toenail?
Severe ingrown toenails are usually treated by a GP or nurse, or a person qualified to diagnose and treat foot disorders (a podiatrist). In some cases, surgery is helpful.
Contact a doctor if:
You have persistent and troublesome symptoms from the ingrown nail.

You have symptoms of infection (as above). If you also have diabetes or a poor immune system (immunosuppression), see a doctor urgently, as infections will need treating quickly.

You have a condition affecting the nerves or feeling (sensation) in your foot. For example, if you have loss of feeling due to diabetes (diabetic neuropathy) affecting the feet. This is because a loss of sensation or nerve damage can make you unaware of problems in the foot, such as a deep infection. So, you will need careful assessment and monitoring. You may be referred to a foot clinic or a podiatrist.

For persistent ingrown toenails
Removing part of the nail may be necessary. This is usually done by a podiatrist. The usual procedure is as follows:
Local anaesthetic will be injected into the base of the toe to make the procedure painless and numb the toe.

The toenail is then cut with scissors longways a few millimetres in from the offending edge.

A small amount of acid (called phenol) is often put on the exposed part of the nail bed. This helps to stop the edge of nail regrowing and causing another ingrown nail.

Once the anaesthetic wears off, the toe may be sore so you may need mild painkillers such as paracetamol for a day or so. You will probably have to wear a bandage for about two weeks. During this time you will not be able to have a bath or go swimming. You also will not be able to do any strenuous exercise, such as running. After the procedure, the nail will regrow but will be narrower than before.
How to prevent ingrown toenails
Cut your nails straight across; do not cut your toenails too short or too low at the sides. The corner of the nail should be visible above the skin. (Tip: it is easier to cut nails after a bath or shower, when they are softer.)

If you have diabetes, you should take extra care when cutting your nails:
Cut the nail straight across or follow the shape of the end of the toe, but be very careful not to cut too low at the sides of the nail.
Gently file any sharp edges with a nail file.
If you have any loss of feeling in your feet, you should visit a podiatrist to have your nails trimmed, rather than doing it yourself.
