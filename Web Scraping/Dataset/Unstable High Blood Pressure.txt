I am on 100mg Losartan and 10mg Amlodipine. Typical Blood Pressure during the day is absolutely fine average 115/75. However, i have been admitted to A&E twice in last past 4 months as my blood pressure has randomly spiked to around 220/120.
Symptons include feeling sick, nosebleed, spaced out etc. Both times i was watching tv so not stress or anxiety related and i dont smoke, take drugs or drink much and weight is ok.
Does anyone know what may cause random blood pressure spikes? I tend to get them most weeks but usually they tend to be in the 170/100 region. My GP doesn’t seem to have much of an insight apart from lifestyle factors/anxiety/stress.
