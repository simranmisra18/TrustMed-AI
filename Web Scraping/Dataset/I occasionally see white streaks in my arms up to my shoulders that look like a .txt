Hey guys!
I have been suffering from chestpain of unknown etiology for a few years now, and occasionally notice a white streak that runs up my tricep and wraps around my shoulder, leading into my body. Sometimes when I'm sitting or laying down, I'll notice I get this streak on both sides. (they are identically mirrored.) I'm assuming this is some variation of bad circulation, but I am a 25 year old healthy male. All bloodwork is normal, no markers, nothing.
Any ideas?

Nah they're called the Cephalic veins, they're superficial / auxilary veins, if you do exercise, say pullups, they'll soon pump up

Hey Benny, sorry, I probably wasnt clear enough. The skin above my vein seems to turn white.

well, I have to say when I read your question I thought maybe your talking about vitiligo but when you said it looks like a vein I figured out what`s up. as the other friend said they are Cephalic veins. try to exercise more and use your arms (especially dancing. I think Michael Jackson dance can be a good choice for you because he used to use of his arms a lot while he was dancing!)
 and soon they`ll disappear!

Hi Hajar,
They look like they run up the same area as a vein would, but I'm not actually seeing a vein. I'm seeing a strain of white skin that runs up my arm and wraps around my shoulder blade. It will appear for minutes and then disappear.

hello! did you figure this out yet? i get the very same thing in my leg with certain positions and I assume it’s veins temporarily emptying. idk if that’s normal though. Maybe it’s been there all the time and I have just noticed. it’s weird.
