I thought it’s because I usually only have beef when it’s a large meal (burgers & pasta) but I noticed I can eat a lot more of anything else, even stuff like pizza and any other meat, without any issues.
My resting heart rate after eating beef can be around the 130s and getting up can bring it up to the 150s.
Could this be some kind of allergy?
(ps I will get to the drs about it eventually if I feel I need to but I’m currently housebound so I appreciate any opinion I can get from here )
