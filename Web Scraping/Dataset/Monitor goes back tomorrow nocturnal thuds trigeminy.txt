hi group, just checking in, i am returning my 5 day monitor tomorrow that recorded plenty of palpitations of various type.. they seem to get rolling after diner, then in bed, woke up 4 am with tri geminy skips, multiple thuds, man, i have had these episodes for decades and this sleep interruption is a new thing...i hope it is a vagus, digestive thing...but my cardiologist dispells this in a polite way as internet folly....so, tomorrow I listen and go over the monitor report....hope all is status quo with the rest ..... have a good night and day..
