Hello!
Thanks for reading this and thank you for the advice!
So… by chance at work I checked my heart rate on my apple watch. One minute the reading gave me 40bpm, the next it was 90-100.
Phoned the docs and went down on the heart rate monitor, as with my watch one minute it’s 40, the next its 90-100.
Doc sent me to accident and emergency and I went on an ECG. The doc said the ECG shows a PVC and reffered me back to my GP to have a 24 hour ECG fitted. Blood test came back negative as did my blood pressure.
Ive no other symptoms and feel fine. Iv’e checked my heart rate data on my phone and since 2019 its been the same…
Since knowing about my heart rate ive been worried sick and i keep checking my heart rate. its been irregular all day, 40 one minute 90 the next!
Should i be worried? Anyone else going through the same.
