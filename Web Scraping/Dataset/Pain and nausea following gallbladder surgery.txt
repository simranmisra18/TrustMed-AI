Hi all,
I had my gallbladder removed in September 2024 after experiencing pancreatitis. I didn’t know that was what it was at the time, the pain always went away after an hour or so. Last September, it didn’t causing me to go to the hospital. I was in the hospital for about a week and my surgery was done with no complications. In the months that followed I was hospitalized again with pancreatitis with my lipase over 6000. I was given fluids and pain meds and sent on my way. Since my gallbladder removal I have experienced severe abdominal pain that feels exactly like pancreatitis, but my lab work looks normal. Additionally, I have had extreme nausea, like lay-in-bed-for-days nausea, which comes with fatigue and muscle weakness. During the nausea spells I can barely stand to take a shower because I feel so weak. There doesn’t seem to be anything that I can pinpoint that triggers the pain or nausea. I’m at such a loss. I am seeing a GI doctor in the next few weeks, but this is so frustrating and upsetting. I know my body and this is not normal for me, but there doesn’t seem to be anything that turns up in any lab work. Has anyone else experienced this? Any suggestions of things to bring up to GI doctor?
