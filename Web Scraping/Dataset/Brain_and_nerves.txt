Migraine causes attacks of headaches, often making you feel sick or causing you to be sick. Treatment options include avoiding possible triggers, painkillers, anti-inflammatory painkillers, anti-sickness medicines, and triptan medicines. A medicine to prevent migraine attacks is an option if the attacks are frequent or severe.

What is a migraine?
Migraine is a condition that causes attacks (episodes) of headaches. Other symptoms such as feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting) are also common. Between migraine attacks, the symptoms go away completely.
Migraine vs. headache
'Migraine' and 'headache' can be confusing terms. Many people use the term 'migraine' to mean a severe headache.
To doctors, a 'headache' is a symptom, whereas 'migraine' is a diagnosis. Lots of different things can cause headaches. Migraines are one of them, and are a very common cause of headaches.
So, a headache is one of the common symptoms of a migraine attack. Migraine attacks can also cause many other symptoms.
Typically, headaches due to migraines:
Last between 4 to 72 hours (unless they end sooner due to treatment).

People with migraine can also develop tension headaches as well, but these will feel different to their migraines.
Migraine vs. cluster headaches
Cluster headaches can also be confused with migraine.
Typically, cluster headaches:
Cause very severe headaches or head pain, usually felt around one eye or over the temple on one side.

What causes migraines?
Migraines are one of the "primary" headache disorders. Primary headache disorders are standalone conditions, whereas "secondary" headaches are caused by other medical problems.
We don't fully understand why migraines happen.
An old, but still influential, theory is that changes in blood flow in the brain cause migraines. This theory proposed that narrowing of blood vessels caused migraine auras, and that when those blood vessels then widen, this causes the headache. However, more recent research indicates that this is not the case, or, at least, that it's not the full story.
It is now thought that some chemicals in the brain increase in activity and parts of the brain may then send out confusing signals which cause the symptoms. The exact changes in brain chemicals are not known. It is also not clear why people with migraine should develop these changes. However, something may trigger a change in activity of some brain chemicals to set off a migraine attack.
Recent research has looked at the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in migraine development. CGRP release seems to be important for transmitting pain signals in migraine. New treatments that target CGRP have been successfully used to treat migraine.
Family history
Migraines are more common in people who have relatives who suffer from migraines. So, there is probably a genetic component to migraines. This is complicated, and not clearly understood.
It's possible that there are many different genes involved in migraines, and that some people inherit a set of genes that make them more likely to develop migraines later.
There are also some very rare types of migraines that do have a clear genetic link, such as familial hemiplegic migraine (see below).
Migraine symptoms
Migraines have up to four different stages, with different symptoms.
Some people only experience one or two of these stages, whereas others go through all of them.
Migraine prodrome
This is the very first part of a migraine attack. Most, but not all, people with migraine experience this, although they may not realise it. The prodrome phase indicates that a migraine is starting. It can last from hours to days.
Symptoms can include:
Feeling irritable.

Some people get other symptoms, or just have a feeling that they know a migraine is going to occur.
Migraine aura
About a quarter of people with migraines experience auras, which occur just before the headache starts. Having these means you have migraine with aura. If you have this, you might get an aura during some migraine attacks, but not in others.
Auras are sometimes called 'warning signs' that indicate a migraine headache is about to start.
Typical auras include:
Visual auras (the most common type of aura), which usually affect one side, such as:
A temporary loss, or blurring, of part of your vision.
A bright, flashing light, often in a C-shaped pattern, a bit like looking through an old-fashioned kaleidoscope, or zig-zag lines.
Objects or letters on a page may seem to rotate, shake, or boil.

Sensory auras (the second most common type of aura), which cause:
Numbness or tingling - usually starting on one side of the body, in one area, and spreading. For example, it might start in the hand, and travel up the arm to affect the face and lips, and sometimes the leg.

Motor auras (rare). These cause weakness of one side of the body, as part of hemiplegic migraines (see below).
Weakness on one side of the body, numbness on one side of the body, slurred speech, and difficulties speaking can also be symptoms of a stroke or TIA.
Telling the difference between a stroke or TIA and a migraine aura can sometimes be difficult, even for doctors.
If you're unsure whether you are having a migraine attack, a stroke, or a TIA, seek emergency medical help.
This is particularly important if it's the first time these symptoms have happened to you.
Other types of migraine aura include an odd smell, food cravings, a feeling of well-being, and other odd sensations.
Auras typically last anywhere from a few minutes to an hour.
The headache phase, or migraine attack, usually starts within an hour of the aura ending. Sometimes, they occur at the same time.
Migraine attack
This is also called the headache phase of a migraine, and is the part that people are most familiar with.
If you only get the headache phase, and never get migraine auras, you have migraine without aura. Around three-quarters of people with migraines have this.
The symptoms of this phase include:
The headache, which is usually on one side of the head, typically at the front or side. Sometimes it is on both sides of the head. Sometimes it starts on one side and then spreads all over the head. The pain is moderate or severe and is often described as throbbing or pulsating. Movements of the head may make it worse. It often begins in the morning but may begin at any time of the day or night.

Brain and nerves
Here in the UK, migraine affects 1 in 7 people and is more prevalent than diabetes, epilepsy and asthma combined. It is the most common and disabling neurological disorder in the UK with 190,000 attacks daily. We investigate the evidence linking histamine and migraine and the treatment options available.

Brain and nerves
Migraine attacks in women may be triggered by periods. Treatment of each migraine attack is no different than usual. However, there are treatments (detailed below) that may prevent period-related migraine attacks from occurring.
by Dr Hayley Willacy, FRCGP
Types of migraine
There are various different types of migraine. Some people experience more than one. Different migraine types include:
Migraine without aura
This is the most common type of migraine.
As the name suggests, this describes a migraine attack that occurs without a migraine aura.
Migraine with aura
Around one quarter of people with migraines get migraines with aura. These are migraine attacks where auras occur before the headache starts. Examples of auras are discussed above.
Menstrual migraine
Some women get migraine attacks around the beginning of their menstrual period. These usually occur in the two days before a period starts, or in the first three days of menstrual bleeding.
This includes women who only get migraines around the start of their period, as well as women who get migraines at other times too, but get particularly bad migraines around the start of their period.
It's thought that these are triggered by the natural drop in oestrogen levels which occurs before a period.
It can also happen in women taking the combined contraceptive pill during the pill-free week, due to the drop in oestrogen that happens then.
Silent migraine
Sometimes, people can get migraine symptoms without a headache. For example, they might get aura symptoms, such as flashing lights or blurred vision, and other migraine symptoms such as feeling sick and being sensitive to light, but without developing a headache.
These are sometimes called silent migraines. The medical term for these is 'acephalgic migraine', which literally means 'migraine without head pain'.
Depending on the symptoms, it can sometimes be difficult to tell these apart from other conditions, such as a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), stroke, or some forms of epilepsy.
Abdominal migraine
This mainly occurs in children. Instead of headaches, the child has attacks of tummy (abdominal) pain which last several hours. Typically, during each attack there is no headache, or only a mild headache.
These may be associated with feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) or aura symptoms.
Children with abdominal migraines usually stop getting them as they grow up, but many of them develop migraine headaches at some point.
They can also occur in adults, although this seems to be rare.
Ocular migraine
This is sometimes also called retinal migraine, ophthalmic migraine or eye migraine.
They causes temporary loss of all or part of the vision in one eye. This may be with or without a headache.
Each attack usually occurs in the same eye. There are no abnormalities in the eye itself and vision returns to normal.
In ocular migraine, the visual symptoms affect only one eye. In migraine with visual aura, the aura usually affects vision in both eyes.
Important note: consult a doctor urgently if you have a sudden loss of vision (particularly if it occurs for the first time). There are various causes of this and these need to be ruled out before ocular migraine can be diagnosed.
Hemiplegic migraine
This is a rare type of migraine with aura.
Hemiplegia is a medical term for weakness or paralysis of one side of the body. So, hemiplegic migraines cause weakness of one side of the body. This may last up to several hours, or even days, before resolving.
Other possible symptoms include:
Severe dizziness (vertigo).

Double vision.
Double vision.
Visual problems.

Hearing problems.

Difficulty speaking or swallowing.

Important note: consult a doctor urgently if you get sudden weakness (particularly if it occurs for the first time). There are other causes of this (such as a stroke) and these need to be ruled out before hemiplegic migraine can be diagnosed.
Hemiplegic migraine can be inherited (familial hemiplegic migraine), which runs in families, or occur for the first time in people with no family history (sporadic hemiplegic migraine).
Vestibular migraine
This is a type of migraine which causes vertigo (a feeling of motion, or like the room is spinning) and severe dizziness. Typical migraine symptoms, such as a headache, usually occur at the same time, although in some episodes the vertigo can occur without any other migraine symptoms.
Vestibular migraine symptoms can last anywhere from a few minutes, up to 72 hours.
Migraine with brainstem aura
This is a rare type of migraine with aura. It used to be called a basilar or basilar-type migraine.
Symptoms typically include headache at the back of the head (rather than one-sided as in common migraine). They also tend to include strange aura symptoms such as:
Temporary loss of vision.

Double vision.

Dizziness.

Unlike hemiplegic migraine, basilar-type migraine does not cause weakness.
Important note: consult a doctor urgently if you develop the symptoms described for basilar-type migraine (particularly if they occur for the first time). There are other causes of these symptoms (such as a stroke) and these need to be ruled out before basilar-type migraine can be diagnosed.
Status migranosus
Migraine attacks typically last a maximum of 72 hours, and often much less than this (especially with effective treatment).
Status migranosus is a particularly severe type of migraine attack. It describes a migraine attack that is persistent and has lasted more than 72 hours without relief, or with brief episodes of relief (from medication or sleep) only.
There are various different treatments for status migranosus. Sometimes, it needs treatment in hospital.
Migraine triggers
Most migraine attacks occur for no apparent reason. However, something may trigger migraine attacks in some people. Triggers can be all sorts of things. For example:
Diet. Missing meals, becoming dehydrated, drinking alcohol, and drinking lots of caffeine can all trigger migraines.
Caffeine withdrawal can also be a trigger, eg, people who drink lots of coffee during the week but none at the weekend can get caffeine withdrawal migraines at the weekend.
Various foods - such as cheese and chocolate - are possible migraine triggers, but it's also possible that people get cravings for these as part of a migraine prodrome, meaning that they eat them before a migraine attack, but that they aren't actually causing it.

It may help to keep a migraine diary. Note down when and where each migraine attack started, what you were doing, and what you had eaten that day. A pattern may emerge, and it may be possible to avoid one or more things that may trigger your migraine attacks. See the leaflet called Migraine trigger diary. This gives more details and includes a diary that you can print out and fill in.
How long do migraines last?
Typically the headache of a migraine without aura lasts from 4 hours to as long as 72 hours.
A migraine aura usually takes a few minutes to develop then lasts for five minutes to an hour before the headache comes. The headache usually starts within an hour of the aura ending and lasts the same as the headache of a migraine without aura.
Migraines can have up to four phases (see above), although not everyone experiences all of these.
Migraine treatment
There are various treatments for a migraine attack, from simple painkillers to migraine medication which is specifically for migraine, such as triptans.
If you take painkillers too often for any kind of headache you may develop medication-overuse headache (also called medication-induced headache and sometimes also called an analgesic headache). You can read more about this type of headache in the separate leaflet called Migraine treatment.
There is also evidence which suggests that a whole food plant-based diet may offer a safe, effective and permanent treatment for reversing chronic migraine.
There are also various treatments you can take to prevent migraine attacks, if you have frequent or severe attacks. It may not stop all attacks, but their number and severity are often reduced. Medicines for preventing migraines are taken every day. They are not painkillers and are different to those used to treat each migraine attack.
Migraine and children
Some points to note about migraine in children include the following:
Migraine is common in children. It affects about 1 in 10 children of school age.

Symptoms can be similar to those experienced by adults. However, sometimes symptoms are not typical. For example, compared with adults, attacks are often shorter, and pain may be on both sides of the head. Also, associated symptoms such as feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may not occur.

Migraine when pregnant or breastfeeding
The good news is that about 2 in 3 women with migraine have an improvement whilst pregnant or breastfeeding. However, about 1 in 20 women with migraine find that their migraine gets worse whilst pregnant. The bad news is that some of the medicines used to treat migraine should not be taken by pregnant or breastfeeding women . Learn more about migraine medication when pregnant or breastfeeding in the separate leaflet called Migraine treatment.
How is migraine diagnosed?
Migraine is diagnosed based on your symptoms.
A doctor should ask about the symptoms in detail, including the features of the headaches and how they are affecting you. They should also ask about other symptoms that might suggest a different cause for your headaches. They should also perform a physical neurological examination. In migraine, the neurological examination should be normal.
There is no test that confirms migraine as the diagnosis. Similarly, tests such as brain scans are not required to make a diagnosis of migraine.
Instead, tests are only useful to rule out other causes of headaches. So, tests might be done if someone has symptoms that are not typical for migraine, or if they have symptoms that suggest another cause of headaches.
Tests are often done in some of the rarer types of migraines, such as hemiplegic migraine and ocular migraine, because the symptoms can be very similar to a TIA, stroke, or another serious problem, and it can be very difficult to tell them apart sometimes.
Remember, if you have migraine, you do not have symptoms between attacks. It is the episodic nature of the symptoms (that is, they come and then go) that is typical of migraine. A headache that does not go, or other symptoms that do not go, are not due to migraine.
Can you prevent migraines?
There are various different things that can help to prevent migraines. These can make migraines happen less often, although it's difficult to completely prevent all migraines.
Everyone has different triggers for migraines. Identifying your own migraine triggers can help you to minimise or avoid them. Keeping a headache diary is really useful for working out what triggers a migraine for you.
General things that can help to prevent migraines include:
Sticking to a daily routine for eating and sleeping. Try to have regular meal times and avoid skipping meals if you can. Changes in sleeping patterns can also trigger migraine - try to get into a consistent sleep routine where you go to sleep and wake up at the same times every day.

Controlling caffeine intake. The links between caffeine and migraines are complicated. Caffeine is actually one of the treatments for a migraine attack. Some people, though, find that caffeine can trigger migraines for them. There is also some evidence that people who consume high amounts of caffeine regularly are more likely to get migraines. Caffeine withdrawal can also trigger migraines. So, whilst you don't need to cut out caffeine completely, it's a good idea to limit your consumption (a maximum of 200mg a day - about two cups of coffee - is sensible).

Exercising regularly. Getting regular exercise can reduce the frequency of migraines, as well as making them less severe if they do happen. Strenuous exercise, particularly if you're not used to it, can be a migraine trigger - so aiming for regular, short sessions of moderate intensity exercise is best, at least to start with.

Multiple sclerosis is a disorder of the brain and spinal cord. It can cause various symptoms. In most cases, episodes of symptoms come and go for several years. In time, some symptoms can become permanent and can cause disability. Although there is no cure for multiple sclerosis, various medicines and therapies may reduce the number of flare-ups and can help to ease symptoms and disability.

What is multiple sclerosis?
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease where patches of inflammation occur in parts of your brain and/or spinal cord. This can cause damage to parts of your brain and lead to various symptoms (described below).
Brain and nerves
Brain scans of people with early signs of multiple sclerosis can predict the long-term prognosis of the disease.

Brain and nerves
About 1 in 100 people are born with an extra rib called a cervical rib. About 1 in 10 people who have a cervical rib develop thoracic outlet syndrome. This happens if the cervical rib squashes the nerves and blood vessels going into the arm. Treatment can include painkillers, physiotherapy and sometimes surgery to relieve the compression caused by, for example, a cervical rib.

Understanding the brain, spinal cord, and nerves
Many thousands of nerve fibres transmit tiny electrical messages (impulses) between different parts of your brain and spinal cord. Each nerve fibre in the brain and spinal cord is surrounded by a protective sheath made from a substance called myelin. The myelin sheath acts like the insulation around an electrical wire. It is needed for the electrical impulses to travel correctly along your nerve fibres.
Nerves are made up from many nerve fibres. Nerves come out of your brain and spinal cord and take messages to and from your muscles, skin, body organs and tissues.
What causes multiple sclerosis?
The exact cause of multiple sclerosis (MS) is unknown. Inflammation that is enabled by the immune system is triggered by an abnormal response to environmental factors. This only occurs in those who are susceptible because of their inherited genes.
When the multiple sclerosis is active, parts of the immune system, mainly T cells, attack the myelin sheath which surrounds the nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord. This is why these types of conditions are called demyelinating diseases.
The inflammation around the myelin sheath prevents the affected nerve fibres from working properly and symptoms develop. When the inflammation clears, the myelin sheath may heal and repair and nerve fibres start to work again. However, the inflammation, or repeated bouts of inflammation, can leave a small scar (sclerosis) which can permanently damage nerve fibres. In a typical person with multiple sclerosis (MS), many (multiple) small areas of scarring develop in the brain and spinal cord. These scars may also be called plaques.
What is multiple sclerosis like?
MS tends to follow one of the following four patterns.
Relapsing-remitting MS
Nearly 9 in 10 people with multiple sclerosis (MS) have the relapsing-remitting form of the disease. In a relapse, an attack (episode) of symptoms occurs. During a relapse, symptoms develop (described below) and may last for days but usually last for 2-6 weeks. They sometimes last for several months. Symptoms of MS then improve or go away which is remission. Further relapses then occur from time to time.
The type and number of symptoms that occur during a relapse of multiple sclerosis vary from person to person. The frequency of relapses also varies. Having one or two relapses every two years is fairly typical. However, relapses can occur more or less often than this. When a relapse occurs, previous symptoms may return, or new ones may appear.
The relapsing-remitting MS pattern tends to last for several years. At first, full recovery from symptoms, or nearly full recovery, is typical following each relapse. In time, in addition to myelin damage, there may also be damage to the nerve fibres themselves.
Eventually, often after 5-15 years, some symptoms may become permanent. The permanent symptoms are due to accumulation of scar tissue in the brain and to the gradual nerve damage that occurs. The condition typically then slowly becomes worse over time and can affect life expectancy. This is called secondary progressive MS. Typically, about two thirds of people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis will have developed secondary progressive MS after 15 years.
Benign MS
10-15% of patients have benign relapsing-remitting MS or 'benign MS'. Benign MS is a variation of relapsing-remitting MS where relapses are very mild, there are very long periods between relapses and/or only a few relapses ever occur.
Secondary progressive form of MS
In this form of multiple sclerosis there is a steady worsening of your symptoms (with or without relapses). Many people with the relapsing-remitting form later develop this type of MS.
Primary progressive form of MS
Primary progressive MS occurs in about 1 in 10 people with multiple sclerosis. There is no initial relapsing-remitting course and the symptoms become gradually worse from the outset and do not recover.
How common is multiple sclerosis?
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common disabling illness of young adults in the UK. About 1 in 500 people in the UK develop multiple sclerosis. It can affect anyone at any age, although it is rare in young children. It often first develops in people aged between 30 and 50. It is more than twice as common in women as in men.
Is multiple sclerosis hereditary?
Multiple sclerosis is not strictly an hereditary disease. However, you have an increased chance of MS developing if you have a close relative with MS. For example, if your mother, father, brother or sister has MS, then you have about a 2 in 100 chance of developing MS (compared with about a 1 in 500 chance in the general population).
What are the symptoms of multiple sclerosis?
Multiple sclerosis causes a wide variety of symptoms. Many people experience only a few symptoms and it is very unlikely that you would develop all the symptoms described here. Symptoms of MS are usually unpredictable.
MS symptoms may worsen gradually with time. More commonly, symptoms come and go at different times.
Multiple sclerosis relapses can occur at any time and your symptoms may differ within each relapse. Although relapses usually occur for no apparent reason, various triggers can include infection, exercise and hot weather. The symptoms that occur during a relapse depend on which part, or parts, of your brain or spinal cord are affected. You may have just one symptom in one part of your body, or several symptoms in different parts of your body. The symptoms occur because the affected nerve fibres stop working properly.
The more common symptoms of multiple sclerosis include:
Visual problems
The first symptom of multiple sclerosis for around one in four people with MS is a disturbance of vision. Inflammation (swelling) of the optic nerve can occur. This is called optic neuritis. This can cause pain behind your eye and also some loss of your vision. This usually only affects one eye. Other eye symptoms may include blurring of your vision or having double vision.
Muscle spasms and spasticity
Tremors or spasms of some of your muscles may occur in MS. This is usually due to damage to the nerves that supply these muscles. Some muscles may shorten (contract) tightly and can then become stiff and harder to use. This is called spasticity.
Pain
There are two main types of pain that may occur in people with multiple sclerosis:
Neuropathic pain - this occurs due to damage to the nerve fibres. This can cause stabbing pains or a burning sensation over parts of your skin. Areas of skin may also become very sensitive.
Neuropathic pain - this occurs due to damage to the nerve fibres. This can cause stabbing pains or a burning sensation over parts of your skin. Areas of skin may also become very sensitive.
Musculoskeletal pain - this type of pain can occur in any of your muscles that are affected by spasms or spasticity.
Musculoskeletal pain - this type of pain can occur in any of your muscles that are affected by spasms or spasticity.
Fatigue
Extreme tiredness (fatigue) is one of the most common symptoms of MS. This tiredness with multiple sclerosis is more than the tiredness expected after exercising or exertion. This fatigue can even affect balance and concentration. There are different treatments for fatigue which are often a combination of self-management strategies, physiotherapy and exercise.
Emotional problems and depression
People with multiple sclerosis might laugh or cry more easily, even for no reason. Also, many people with MS have symptoms of depression or anxiety at some stage. Acknowledging this and asking for support is important. Your GP can discuss the treatment options available.
Other symptoms of multiple sclerosis which may occur include:
Numbness or tingling in parts of your skin. This is the most common symptom of a first relapse.

Secondary MS symptoms
These are symptoms that may develop later in the course of the disease when some of the above symptoms become permanent. Symptoms including contractures, urine infections, bone fragility (osteoporosis), muscle wasting and reduced mobility may be experienced.
How is multiple sclerosis diagnosed?
Almost all the symptoms that can occur with MS can also occur with other diseases. It is often difficult to be sure if a first episode of symptoms (a first relapse) is due to MS. For example, an episode of numbness in a leg, or blurring of vision for a few weeks, may have been the first relapse of MS or just a one-off illness that was not MS.
A firm diagnosis of MS is often not made until two or more relapses have occurred. So, there may be months, or years, of uncertainty when there is an episode of symptoms and the diagnosis is not yet clear. This can be a very difficult time for many people.
Can you test for multiple sclerosis?
In most cases, no test can definitely prove that you have multiple sclerosis after a first episode of symptoms or in the very early stages of the disease. However, some tests are helpful and may indicate that MS is a possible, or probable, cause of the symptoms.
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain is a useful test. This type of scan can detect small areas of inflammation and scarring in your brain which occur in multiple sclerosis. Although very useful in helping to make a diagnosis of MS, MRI scans are not always conclusive, especially in the early stages of the disease. A scan result should always be viewed together with your symptoms and physical examination.
Since MRI scans became available, other tests for multiple sclerosis are now done less often. However, they are sometimes done and include:
Lumbar puncture. In this test a needle is inserted, under local anaesthetic, into the lower part of your back. It takes a sample of some of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord. This is called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Certain protein levels are measured. Some proteins are altered in multiple sclerosis, although they can be altered in other conditions too.

Can multiple sclerosis be treated?
At present there is no cure for multiple sclerosis. However many symptoms of MS can be eased to improve quality of life and make living with MS more manageable. Treatments generally fall into four categories:
Medicines that aim to modify the disease process.

Steroid medication to treat relapses.

Other medicines to help ease symptoms.

Medicines that aim to modify the disease process
These medicines are known as immunomodulatory agents. They do not cure MS and they are not suitable for everyone with MS.
Fingolimod, Ponesimod, Teriflunomide, Diroximel fumarate and Dimethyl fumarate are the only tablet forms of disease-modifying treatment. All the others are given by injection.
Natalizumab, Alemtuzumab, Ofatumumab, Ublituximab and Ocrelizumab are given by injection and are used for patients with more advanced or active disease.
Newer medicines and combinations of medicines are also being developed and studied.
Studies have shown that these medicines reduce the number of relapses for some people. They may also have a small effect on slowing the progression of the disease. The exact way in which they work is not always clear but they all interfere with the immune system in some way.
As there is still some uncertainty as to the role of these medicines and how effective they are, guidelines have been drawn up as to when they may be prescribed on the NHS. A consultant neurologist will advise on which of the treatments are recommended. Each of the different disease-modifying medicines has pros and cons. The Multiple Sclerosis Trust (see under 'Further Reading', below) provides an MS Decisions page which is designed to help you decide which is the best medicine for you.
If any of these treatments are prescribed, further monitoring and review also happens. With the help of this monitoring, over time, it should become clear how effective the treatments are.
Steroids for multiple sclerosis (sometimes called corticosteroids)
A steroid is often prescribed if there is a relapse which causes disability. A high dose is usually given for a few days. Sometimes steroid tablets are used or the steroid may be given through veins. The steroids work by reducing inflammation. A course of steroids will usually shorten the duration of a relapse. This means that symptoms usually improve more quickly than they would otherwise have done.
However, steroids do not affect the ongoing progression of the disease.
Other treatments to improve MS symptoms
Depending on which symptoms develop, other treatments may be advised. For example:
Anti-spasm medicines.

Painkillers. There are specific types of painkillers which can improve neuropathic pain.

NICE provided guidance on the use of cannabis-related medicinal products for muscle spasticity in MS. The guidance recommends that people with moderate-to-severe muscle spasticity (which has not responded to other treatments), may be offered treatment with a cannabis-based mouth spray called Sativex® for four weeks. If the symptoms improve by at least 20% in this time, longer-term treatment may be offered.
This treatment should be started and supervised by an MS specialist doctor. Find out more about this treatment in our separate leaflet called Cannabis-based medicinal products (Medicinal marijuana).

Driving
If you drive a car or ride a motorcycle, you must tell the DVLA that you have multiple sclerosis. However you can continue to drive or ride a motorcycle as long as you can drive safely at all times.
Multiple sclerosis outlook (prognosis)
Multiple sclerosis affects different people in many different ways. This means that it is very difficult to predict your outlook (prognosis) if you have MS. There are currently no tests to predict how your MS will progress.
Many people with MS will be able to continue to walk and function at their work for many years after their diagnosis.
However, some people with MS do become disabled over time, and a minority become severely disabled.
The treatment of MS is a rapidly developing area of medicine. The research into newer and better disease-modifying treatments brings a great deal of hope that the outlook for people with MS will continue to improve in the future and hopefully slow the progress of symptoms. The specialist who knows your case can give more accurate information about the outlook for your particular situation.

Motor neurone disease (MND) is a neurological condition causes a progressive weakness and wasting of many of the muscles in the body. There are various types of motor neurone disease. This leaflet is mainly about amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is the most common type of motor neurone disease. Although there is no cure for motor neurone disease, treatments can help to ease symptoms and disability.

What is motor neurone disease?
In motor neurone disease (MND), motor nerves become damaged and eventually stop working. Therefore, the muscles that the damaged nerves supply gradually lose their strength.
There are various subtypes of MND. In each type, symptoms tend to start in different ways. However, as the disease progresses, the symptoms of each type of MND tend to overlap. This means that symptoms in the later stages of each type of MND become similar.
Types of motor neurone disease
The main types of MND are:
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of MND. About 8 in 10 people with MND have this type. Symptoms tend to start in the hands and feet. The muscles tend to become stiff as well as weak at first. ALS is also sometimes known as Lou Gehrig's disease in the United States of America, after the baseball player who was diagnosed with it.
Progressive bulbar palsy (PBP)
About 2 in 10 people with MND have this type. The muscles first affected are those used for talking, chewing and swallowing (the bulbar muscles).
Progressive muscular atrophy (PMA)
This is an uncommon form of MND. The small muscles of the hands and feet are usually first affected but the muscles are not stiff.
Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS)
This is a rare type of MND. It mainly causes weakness in the leg muscles. Some people with this type may also develop clumsiness in the hands or develop speech problems.
The rest of this leaflet is just about the ALS type of MND (ALS-MND).
Motor neurone disease (ALS) symptoms
This disease affects the muscles in different ways.
The main feature of ALS-MND is muscle weakness which is mild at first, but gradually becomes worse. Usually, the first symptoms of ALS develop in the hands and arms or in the feet and legs. Less commonly, the first symptoms are in the muscles around the face and throat (the bulbar muscles):

How do ALS symptoms progress?
Symptoms may affect just one arm or leg at first. They then gradually become worse and spread to involve other limbs. ALS eventually causes many muscles in the body to become affected. Some muscle groups may be more badly affected than others. Muscles gradually become weaker and wasted. The problems that develop may eventually include the following:
Walking (mobility) typically becomes worse.

Doing tasks with your arms and hands becomes increasingly difficult.

You may become breathless on minimal exertion when the chest muscles become affected.

What causes motor neurone disease (ALS)?
The cause is not known. It is thought that certain chemicals or structures that only occur in motor nerves are damaged in some way. The reason why the nerves become damaged is not clear. (It is also not clear why sensory nerves, which have a similar structure, are not affected.)
There may be one or more environmental factors that may trigger the damage in someone who is prone to the disease. Research continues in order to find the underlying cause of the damage to the nerves.
How common is motor neurone disease (ALS)?
ALS motor neurone disease is uncommon in the UK. There are about 4,000 people in the UK with ALS-MND.
Who gets motor neurone disease (ALS)?
ALS-MND can affect anyone. ALS-MND is rare under the age of 40 years. It usually develops between the ages of 50 and 70 years. It is more common in men than in women.
For the majority of cases, it is not inherited and it does not run in families. In around 1 to 2 out of 20 cases of ALS, a family member has been affected, and there may be an inherited factor involved.
What is not affected in motor neurone disease (ALS)?
Intellect does not usually change, as the thinking part or the brain is not usually affected. However, in about 10-15 out of 100 people with MND, a type of dementia develops. In up to 35 out of 100 others, there may be a mild effect on thinking ability.

Emotional feelings and sexual desire are not directly changed by ALS-MND. However, some people with ALS-MND suddenly cry or laugh in inappropriate moments. (This is not a sign of mental illness but a feature of ALS-MND and cannot be helped, although may be embarrassing when it occurs.) Also, depression and anxiety are common.

How is motor neurone disease (ALS) diagnosed?
Unfortunately, there is no test that confirms ALS-MND. People with suspected ALS-MND are normally referred to a specialist (neurologist) for assessment. At first it may be difficult for a specialist to be sure that you have ALS-MND when early minor symptoms first develop.
However, the diagnosis usually becomes clear as the typical symptoms and signs of the disease gradually become worse. It can typically take a year from when the first symptoms start to the diagnosis being confirmed.
Tests are often done to exclude other causes of your symptoms. The following tests may be advised:
Electromyography (EMG). In this test, very small needles are used to record the nerve impulses occurring within your muscles (usually in your arms, legs and throat).

Motor neurone disease (ALS) treatment
Although there is no cure for ALS-MND, treatments can help both to slow the disease and also to improve any symptoms you may have.
Riluzole
Riluzole is a medicine which has been shown in clinical trials to have a beneficial effect on the survival of people with ALS-MND. It can slow down the disease progression by a few months. Riluzole works by its effect on glutamate - a chemical which relays signals between a nerve and another cell in the central nervous system.
Glutamate in excess has been shown to cause brain and spinal cord nerve damage. Riluzole helps to inhibit the amount of glutamate released in nerve impulse transmissions. This has some protective effect on the nerves.
Respiratory care
In this treatment, you are given a mask ventilator system to wear overnight while you are sleeping. The machines are small and portable and you can choose from a variety of different masks to suit you. People using this have been shown not only to have longer survival but also an improvement in the quality of their lives.
Treatments to help ease symptoms
Treatments are available for many of the symptoms that you may develop with ALS-MND. These may include cramps, difficulty swallowing saliva and food, urinary symptoms and depression.
It can be fairly common for people with ALS-MND to have feeding problems. These may either be due to difficulty swallowing or to difficulty in actually feeding yourself due to the weakness in your arms and hands. Some people find that having thickened fluid and sitting very upright when eating are beneficial.
If you are losing weight as a result of having feeding difficulties then you may benefit from having a gastrostomy inserted. This is a small feeding tube that is placed through the wall of the tummy (abdomen) directly into your stomach. Your doctor will discuss this in more detail with you if this might be appropriate for you.
Most people with ALS-MND are cared for by a professional team which includes neurologists, specialist nurses, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, dieticians and counsellors. Each problem that arises is assessed and dealt with as far as possible by the relevant members of the team.
What is the outlook for motor neurone disease?
MND does shorten life expectancy, and is a fatal illness. However, there is huge variation in how quickly ALS progresses, and it is different in each person who has it. Muscles weakened by ALS-MND do not recover. However, weeks or months may go by where the disease does not seem to progress. Eventually, severe disability develops. As the disease becomes severe, people with ALS-MND are unable to walk, talk or eat, and need a lot of care.
How quickly does motor neurone disease progress?
Your specialist may be able to give you an idea of how quickly MND is likely to progress in your particular case. However, the outlook (prognosis) for people with ALS-MND is extremely variable:
About 7 in 10 people with ALS-MND die within three years of the onset of symptoms.
About 7 in 10 people with ALS-MND die within three years of the onset of symptoms.
About 25 in 100 survive five years.
About 25 in 100 survive five years.
About 5-10 in 100 survive 10 years or more.
About 5-10 in 100 survive 10 years or more.
In the other, rarer types of MND, progress may be slower and the outlook better.
There are many research studies looking at different potential treatments for ALS-MND. It is hoped that new treatments will be introduced in the future.
Understanding nerves
Nerves (neurons) are like wires that carry tiny messages (electrical impulses) between the brain, the spinal cord and the rest of the body.
Motor nerves carry messages from the brain and spinal cord to muscles, and make the muscles contract.

Meets Patient’s editorial guidelines
The main symptoms of Parkinson's disease are usually stiffness, shaking (tremor), and slowness of movement. People with Parkinson's may also develop other symptoms (listed below). Symptoms typically become gradually worse over time. Treatment often provides good relief of symptoms for several years.

What is Parkinson's disease?
Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological degeneration of certain cells (called dopaminergic cells) within a specific part of the brain (substantia nigra). The deficiency of dopamine leads to a movement disorder with Parkinson's disease symptoms.
Parkinson's disease symptoms
The brain cells and nerves affected in Parkinson's disease (PD) normally help to produce smooth, co-ordinated movements of muscles. When this system goes wrong, movement disorders (motor symptoms) occur. Three common PD symptoms that gradually develop are:
Slowness of movement (bradykinesia). For example, it may become more of an effort to walk or to get up out of a chair. When this first develops you may mistake it as just 'getting on in years'. The diagnosis of PD may not become apparent unless other symptoms occur. In time, a typical walking pattern often develops. This is a 'shuffling' walk with some difficulty in starting, stopping and turning easily.

Stiffness of muscles (rigidity) and muscles may feel more tense. Also, your arms do not tend to swing as much when you walk.

Shaking (tremor) is common, but does not always occur. It typically affects the fingers, thumbs, hands and arms but can affect other parts of the body. It is most noticeable when you are resting. It may become worse when you are anxious or emotional. It tends to become less when you use your hand to do something such as picking up an object.

It may become worse when you are anxious or emotional. It tends to become less when you use your hand to do something such as picking up an object.
The symptoms in the early stages of Parkinson's disease tend to be mild but slowly become worse. However, the speed at which symptoms become worse varies from person to person. It may take several years before they become bad enough to have much effect on your life. At first, one side of your body may be more affected than the other.
Some other symptoms may develop due to problems with the way affected brain cells and nerves control the muscles. These include:
Fewer facial expressions such as smiling or frowning. Reduced blinking.

Also, for reasons that are unclear, people with a medical history of PD have an increased risk of developing melanoma skin cancer. So, if you have PD, you should ensure that you use sun cream, stay out of the sun in the hottest part of the day, wear a sunhat and protect your skin from the sun where possible. See the separate leaflets called Melanoma Skin Cancer and Sun and Sunburn for more details.
Brain and nerves
Parkinson's and dementia are separate conditions, with many people developing one without the other. This said, people with Parkinson's have a higher risk of dementia, particularly during old age. The two main types of dementia that people with Parkinson's can develop are 'Parkinson's dementia' and 'dementia with Lewy bodies'.
by Amberley Davis
Brain and nerves
A tremor is a shaking or trembling in your body which you are unable to control. Anxiety, fear, feeling generally unwell and fever can all make you feel trembly - the expression 'shaking in his boots' is one we all recognise. Of course, feeling shaky without knowing what's causing it can make you feel anxious - which can lead to a vicious cycle of shakiness.
by Dr Rosalyn Adleman, MRCGP
Parkinson's disease stages
There are 5 stages of Parkinson's disease, according to the severity of the symptoms:
Stage 1: the earliest stage. Features include mild tremors and mild difficulty with walking. There may also be less facial expressions, but the symptoms do not greatly interfere with daily life.

What causes Parkinson's disease?
PD is a disorder of the nervous system. A small part of the brain, called the substantia nigra, is mainly affected. This area of the brain sends messages down nerves in the spinal cord to help control the muscles of the body. Messages are passed between brain cells, nerves and muscles by chemicals called neurotransmitters. The brain cells in the substantia nigra produce dopamine, the main neurotransmitter.
If you have PD, a number of cells in the substantia nigra become damaged and die. The exact cause of this is not known. Over time, more and more cells become damaged and die. As cells are damaged, the amount of dopamine that is produced is reduced. A combination of the reduction of cells and a low level of dopamine in the cells in this part of the brain causes nerve messages to the muscles to become slowed and abnormal.
The risk of developing Parkinson's disease seems to involve genetic and environmental factors. Parkinson's disease can run in families as a result of faulty genes, Some chemicals, such as pesticides and herbicides, and pollution may contribute. However Parkinson's disease is not an inherited condition and there is currently no strong evidence to link any particular gene or chemical to Parkinson's disease.
Who develops Parkinson's disease?
PD mainly develops in people over the age of 50. It becomes more common with increasing age. About 5 in 1,000 people in their 60s and about 40 in 1,000 people in their 80s have PD. It affects men and women but is a little more common in men. Rarely, it develops in people under the age of 50.
PD is not usually inherited and it can affect anyone. However, one type of PD, which appears in the small number of people who develop it before the age of 50, may be linked to inherited (genetic) factors. Several family members may be affected.
Does Parkinson's disease cause dementia?
The cells in the brain affected in PD are not in the 'thinking' parts of the brain and dementia is not a typical early feature of PD. However, if you have PD you have an increased risk of developing dementia.
About half of people with Parkinson's disease develop dementia at some stage. If dementia occurs, it tends to develop in older people with PD (aged over 70). Early dementia in younger people with PD virtually never develops.
It is thought that PD alone does not cause dementia; however, other age-related factors in addition to PD may increase the risk of dementia developing.
How is Parkinson's disease diagnosed?
There are no tests that can conclusively show that you have Parkinson's disease. Diagnosing Parkinson's disease is based on symptoms.
If your GP suspects that you may have Parkinson's disease, you will be referred to a neurology specialist. You will likely have some tests in hospital to rule out other causes of your symptoms, such as a brain scan.
Parkinson's disease treatments
There is no cure for PD, and no treatment prevents the disease from progressing. However, treatments can usually ease symptoms.
At first, you may not need any treatment when the symptoms are mild. A specialist may simply see you every now and then to monitor how the disease is progressing.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has just approved a few devices to help monitor people's symptoms. This is because people's symptoms come and go or they just might not remember. Assessing symptoms is so important in personalising treatment plans and making sure the medication is right, increased or changed on time to improve quality of life.
The devices currently approved are: Kinesia 360, KinesiaU, PDMonitor, Personal KinetiGraph (PKG) and STAT‑ON. Your doctor will decide whether a device is appropriate for you and which one would suit you better if needed.
Which medicines are used to treat Parkinson's disease?
Guidelines recommend starting with a dopamine agonist, levodopa with a dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor or a monoamine-oxidase inhibitor. Other medicines are also sometimes used, usually in addition to one of these three main types of medication.
Levodopa
This medicine has been used for many years. Nearly all people with PD notice a good improvement in symptoms after starting levodopa. The body converts levodopa to dopamine. Therefore, the low level of dopamine in the affected part of the brain increases with levodopa. A low dose is usually started at first. Over time, the dose often needs to be increased to control the symptoms.
Levodopa is always combined with another medicine (either benserazide or carbidopa). These prevent levodopa from being converted into dopamine in the bloodstream. This reduces side-effects and increases the amount that gets to the brain where it is converted to dopamine. The combination of levodopa and benserazide is called co-beneldopa and the combination of levodopa and carbidopa is called co-careldopa.
Side-effects sometimes occur when you first start levodopa. However, most people have no problems with low doses. Read the leaflet in the medicine packet for a full list of possible side-effects.
Feeling sick (nausea) is the most common. This is less likely to occur if you take a small dose at first and then gradually build it up. If nausea is a problem, then it can usually be eased by an anti-sickness medicine. Compulsive behaviour may occasionally be a side-effect of levodopa.
Levodopa tends to work less well over time. Therefore, the dose usually needs to be increased every now and then. Unfortunately, over time as the dose increases (typically after several years), most people taking levodopa develop problems. These include 'on-off' effects.
When this occurs, you can switch quite suddenly between being 'on' and able to move to being 'off' and immobile. Muscle problems also commonly develop which can cause uncontrollable jerky movements and other effects (dyskinesias). These problems related to long-term use of levodopa can become quite disabling, tiring and painful.
A Duodopa® pump is sometimes offered to people with severe movement problems who don't respond to medicine taken by mouth. This consists of a small pump with a tube which passes through the skin. It delivers a steady flow of a combination of levodopa and carbidopa to the upper part of the small intestine.
Dopamine agonists
Dopamine agonists are medicines that act on the same receptors in the brain as dopamine. So, in effect, they act like a substitute for dopamine. Unlike levodopa, they do not need to be converted in the body to become active. There are several types. Ropinirole, pramipexole or rotigotine are used most commonly.
Possible side-effects when one is first started are similar to levodopa (nausea, etc). However, the side-effects tend to ease off over several days or weeks. Again, if nausea is a problem, it can usually be eased by an anti-sickness medicine. Also, drowsiness can occur with these medicines.
Drowsiness may be severe and may affect your ability to drive. Impulsive and compulsive behaviour can be a side-effects and are more common with this group of medicines than with levodopa. Impulsive behaviour means that a person has difficulty controlling the urge to carry out certain activities such as gambling or binge eating. Compulsive behaviour means that a person has an overwhelming urge to act in a certain way to reduce stress, such as repetitive washing of their hands.
Other side-effects are less common but read the leaflet in the medicine packet for a full list of possible side-effects.
Sometimes a dopamine agonist is used in combination with levodopa in the later stages of PD. Apomorphine is another dopamine agonist that is used in combination with levodopa. It needs to be given by an injection under the skin. It is used in people who have PD in its later stages who have severe 'off' episodes where they become immobile. It can help to reverse these 'off' episodes but its effect only lasts for about an hour. Frequent injections are therefore needed.
Because of this, sometimes the medicine is given as a continuous infusion, using tubing with a needle at the end (called a cannula) that is inserted under the skin so that the medicine can flow into your body.
Monoamine-oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors
These medicines are another alternative to levodopa for early PD. They include selegiline, rasagiline and safinamide. These medicines work by blocking (inhibiting) the effect of a chemical in the brain called MAO-B. This chemical is involved in the breakdown of levodopa and dopamine. If the action of MAO-B is inhibited then the effect of any dopamine lasts longer.
Most people will require levodopa eventually. However, if you take an MAO-B inhibitor at first, it may delay the need for levodopa for months or years.
Sometimes these medicines are used in combination with levodopa in the later stages of PD.
Other medicines used for PD
Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors are relatively new medicines. They include tolcapone, entacapone and opicapone. These help to stop the breakdown of levodopa by the body, so more of each dose of levodopa can get into the brain to work. A COMT inhibitor is sometimes advised in addition to levodopa when symptoms are not well controlled by levodopa alone.

A COMT inhibitor is sometimes advised in addition to levodopa when symptoms are not well controlled by levodopa alone.
Other medicines are sometimes used to help relieve symptoms. They have various effects which try to correct the chemical imbalance in the brain. They include beta-blockers, amantadine and anticholinergic medicines. One of these may be tried when symptoms are mild. However, you are likely to need levodopa or a dopamine agonist at some point.

Various things may influence which medicine is advised. For example, your age, severity of symptoms, how well your symptoms respond to treatment, if side-effects develop, other medicines that you may take, etc. Your specialist will advise on the best medicine for you to take.
Whatever medicine or medicines you are prescribed, read the leaflet in the medicine packet for a full list of possible side-effects. Mention to your doctor if you develop a troublesome side-effect. A modification of the dose, dose schedule, or the type of medication, may be possible to help keep side-effects to a minimum.
The dose of the medicine that you start with usually needs to be increased over time. In time, combinations of medicines may be required for best control of symptoms. The treatment schemes and doses can vary greatly from person to person. As the disease progresses, the symptoms may not be so well controlled by medicines.
Other treatments for Parkinson's disease
A specialist nurse
A specialist PD nurse is available in many PD clinics, to provide support, information and counselling. A specialist nurse can also monitor response to treatment and give advice on how to adjust medication if necessary.
Therapies
For example:
A physiotherapist can advise on posture, walking and exercises.

Surgery
Surgical techniques are being developed which may help some people who have had PD for several years. Surgery does not cure PD but may help to ease symptoms when medicines are not working well. For example, deep brain stimulation is a technique that involves putting a pulse generator (like a heart pacemaker) in the chest wall.
Fine cables are tunnelled under the skin to electrodes placed in the brain. The electrodes stimulate the parts of the brain that are affected by PD and can help to ease symptoms. The long-term safety of this surgery is not certain and a trial is underway to look at this.
Complementary therapies
Complementary therapies do not affect symptoms or the course of the disease. However, some therapies are good at easing stress and anxiety, which may help in your general well-being. Beware of any treatment that claims to 'cure' PD.
Some other general points
Stay as active as possible. Exercise regularly as much as you are able. This may not be possible when the condition is more advanced. However, it is something to consider when symptoms are not too bad. You may walk more slowly than before but a daily walk is good exercise and may help to loosen up stiff muscles.
Well-meaning relatives or friends may tell you to rest and take things easy. However, as much as possible and for as long as possible, resist the temptation for others to do things for you just because it may be quicker.
Constipation is common in people with PD. Help to reduce the chance of this by having lots to drink and eat plenty of vegetables, fruit, and foods high in fibre. Exercise can also improve constipation. Sometimes laxatives may be needed to treat constipation.
Some medicines taken for other conditions can interfere with dopamine and make PD worse. These may be prescribed for such things as mental illness, sickness, vertigo and dizziness. Check with your doctor if you are unsure about any medicines that you take.
Medication. Make sure you know exactly when to take your medication. Dose schedules and timings are important. A pharmacist will be able to advise and help if you have difficulty in getting tablets out of blister packs, have difficulty in remembering when to take your medicines, or have any other queries about medication.
Report any suspected side-effects to your doctor. For example, seeing or hearing things (hallucinations), confusion and mental changes are possible side-effects of some medicines used to treat PD.
Driving. If you are a driver you should tell the DVLA and your insurance company if you develop PD. Your insurance may be invalid if you do not. Depending on the severity of symptoms and the medicines that you are taking, you may still be allowed to drive following a medical assessment.
Depression is common in people with PD. Depression can cause symptoms which may seem as if PD is getting worse (such as lack of energy and becoming slower). If you seem to become worse quite quickly, over a few weeks or so, depression may be the cause. Tell your doctor if you suspect this. Depression can often be treated.
Some practical tips may help. For example: it is easier to get up from a high chair than from a low couch; consider using Velcro® fasteners instead of buttons; carrying a walking stick when out may increase your confidence if unsteadiness is a problem. Parkinson's UK has plenty of further advice on coping and living with PD.
What is the outlook (prognosis)?
The symptoms of PD tend to become gradually worse over time. However, the speed of progression varies greatly from person to person. When symptoms first begin, you may not need treatment when symptoms are relatively mild.
Most people with PD can expect to have some time of relatively mild symptoms. Then, when the symptoms become worse, they can expect several years of good or reasonable control of the symptoms with medication.
But everyone is different and it is difficult to predict for an individual how quickly the disease will progress. Some people may only be slightly disabled 20 years after PD first begins, whereas others may be very disabled after 10 years.
Research into Parkinson's disease
Research into PD is active. For example, one main aim of research is to find medicines that prevent the damage to the affected cells, rather than just treating the symptoms, which is the main value of treatment at present. Further research on these chemicals continues.
Research is underway using stem cell therapy to help treat PD. Other researchers are looking at alpha synuclein, a protein that gathers around the junction between nerve cells and is thought to affect the way messages are conducted between the brain and the nerves controlling movement.
