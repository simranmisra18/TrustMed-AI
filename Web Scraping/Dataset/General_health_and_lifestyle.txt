What is orlistat?
Orlistat is a medicine which can help you to lose weight if you have overweight or obesity. Orlistat works by blocking chemicals (enzymes) in your gut which digest fat. Orlistat stops about a third of the fat that you eat from being digested. The undigested fat is not absorbed into your body and is passed out with your stools (faeces).
Orlistat dosage
The normal dose on prescription is one capsule - 120 mg, three times a day with each meal. 60 mg capsules (Alli®) can also be bought without prescription from a pharmacy (see below) - again, the recommended dose is one capsule with each meal, up to three times a day. However, you do not need to take one if there is no fat in the meal or if you miss a meal.
Other weight loss medicines
Other medicines used for weight loss include liraglutide (Saxenda®), tirzepatide (Mounjaro®) and semaglutide (Wegovy®). These were originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, but are increasingly used for weight loss treatment as well.
The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that these are only used by specialist weight management clinics, for people who have obesity, pre-diabetes, a high risk of developing heart disease (eg having high cholesterol), and alongside a low-calorie diet and increased exercise, for a maximum of two years. They are therefore usually only offered on the NHS for people who meet those criteria, although they are widely available privately.
Two other medicines - sibutramine and rimonabant - previously used to help with weight loss are no longer available in the UK because of concerns over their safety.
How does orlistat work?
Orlistat works by interfering with the way fat is digested and absorbed into the body. Doctors have guidelines as to when orlistat can be prescribed. You can also buy orlistat from pharmacies - but certain conditions apply, detailed below.
If you take orlistat, it may possibly interfere with the absorption of some vitamins, so you should take a multivitamin supplement. Take this at least two hours before, or two hours after taking orlistat. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you take any other medicines, as orlistat can interfere with the absorption of some medicines.
Doctors usually calculate whether you are underweight, in the 'ideal' weight range, overweight or obese based on your BMI, or body mass index. You can work out your BMI from our BMI calculator.
One way to help with weight loss is to reduce the amount of fat in your diet. See the separate leaflet called Weight reduction.
What special dietary instructions should I follow while taking orlistat?
It is recommended that you reduce your fat intake to 30% of your total calorie intake whilst taking orlistat. Orlistat reduces how much fat gets absorbed from the gut. Fat that isn't absorbed comes out in poo.
So, eating a high-fat diet alongside taking orlistat can worsen side-effects such as flatulence (farting), fatty or oily poo, oily spotting on underwear, increased number of bowel movements, needing to use the toilet suddenly, and loose stools..
Tips on how to reduce your fat intake
Change from butter or regular spreads to a low-fat spread.

Does orlistat work?
Studies have shown that, on average, orlistat, plus a weight-reducing diet and exercise, causes more weight loss than a weight-reducing diet and exercise alone. Some people lose 10% or more of their body weight within six months with the help of orlistat. In others, it is less effective.
One reason why orlistat may not work is that you may think that you can relax your weight-reducing diet, and the orlistat will 'do it all'. This is not true. In order to lose weight you still have to eat less and exercise regularly.
Remember, orlistat prevents only some of the fat that you eat from being absorbed (just under a third). But, if you do not keep to a healthy weight-reducing diet, and you eat more fat or sugar (chocolates, cakes, etc), the extra fat that you eat will easily cancel out the effect of the orlistat.
Who can use orlistat?
Orlistat isn't suitable for everyone who wants to lose weight. It is only recommended in people over a certain body mass index (BMI). Doctors should ensure that changes to eating and exercise habits have been tried first for weight loss, and should only use orlistat alongside these, and not on its own.
Doctors are expected to use the following guidelines when prescribing orlistat:
Your BMI:
Must be 30 or above; or
Must be 28 or above, and you have a medical condition that would benefit from losing weight (such as diabetes or high blood pressure).
Your BMI:
Must be 30 or above; or

Must be 28 or above, and you have a medical condition that would benefit from losing weight (such as diabetes or high blood pressure).
Must be 28 or above, and you have a medical condition that would benefit from losing weight (such as diabetes or high blood pressure).
The goal is a 5% (or more) weight loss within three months of starting orlistat. If this hasn't happened, orlistat is unlikely to be an effective treatment for you, and should be stopped.
The goal is a 5% (or more) weight loss within three months of starting orlistat. If this hasn't happened, orlistat is unlikely to be an effective treatment for you, and should be stopped.
How long does orlistat take to work?
As long as orlistat has successfully helped in reducing weight by 5% or more after three months, there's no restriction on how long it can be used for. However, it should be regularly reviewed with your doctor. If the side-effects are becoming difficult to manage, or if it's no longer working (for example, your weight is static or increasing), then it may be time to stop.
Keeping to a reduced weight
After treatment is stopped, a number of people who have lost weight with the help of orlistat put weight back on. Try to anticipate this. Once you have lost some weight, you are more likely to keep your weight down if you stick to a healthy diet, exercise regularly (if you are able) and weigh yourself once a week.
See the separate leaflet called Obesity and weight loss for more details.
Can I buy orlistat?
In the UK orlistat 120 mg is available on prescription from your doctor or as a private (paid for) service from some pharmacies through Patient Access. Low-dose orlistat (60 mg) is also available to buy over the counter in pharmacies, based on pharmacists' clinical judgement. Pharmacists are also expected to follow guidelines when giving orlistat, which include:
Your BMI must be 28 or above.
Your BMI must be 28 or above.
Your BMI should be checked on each occasion that you request orlistat.
Your BMI should be checked on each occasion that you request orlistat.
You must be over the age of 18 years.
You must be over the age of 18 years.
You should not take orlistat for more than six months over the counter (at the 60 mg dose).
You should not take orlistat for more than six months over the counter (at the 60 mg dose).
If you have not lost at least 5% of your weight after taking orlistat for three months, you should not continue to take it.
If you have not lost at least 5% of your weight after taking orlistat for three months, you should not continue to take it.
Your pharmacist will also give you advice on an appropriate diet - a low-fat and reduced calorie diet.
Orlistat side-effects
The common side-effects of orlistat are caused by the fat which is passed out with your stools (faeces). You may have fatty smelly stools, urgency to get to the toilet, oily spotting on your underwear, and excess wind.
These side-effects are less likely if you eat a low-fat diet. They tend to settle with time, possibly because if they occur they remind you that you should be eating a low-fat diet. Other side-effects are rare.
Note: the above is not the full list of side-effects for those taking orlistat. Please see the leaflet that comes with your medicine for a full list of possible side-effects and cautions.
Who should not take orlistat?
The following people should not take orlistat:
Pregnant or breastfeeding women.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women.
People under the age of 18 years.
People under the age of 18 years.
People who have a condition where food is not absorbed properly (a malabsorption syndrome).

If you have obesity or overweight, you have an increased risk of developing various health problems, including cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Even a modest amount of weight loss can help to reduce your increased health risks. The best chance of losing weight and keeping the weight off, is to be committed to a change in lifestyle. This includes eating a healthy diet and doing some regular physical activity.

What is obesity?
Obesity is the medical term for being very overweight. If you have obesity or overweight, this means that you are carrying excess body fat. Having overweight or obesity is not just about how you look. Over time, it means that you have an increased risk of developing various health problems.
How to tell if you have obesity
As an adult, you can find out whether you have overweight or obesity and whether your health may be at risk, by calculating your body mass index (BMI) and measuring your waist circumference. For children, see the separate leaflet called Childhood obesity.
Body mass index (BMI)
BMI is used by healthcare professionals to assess if someone's weight is putting their health at risk. It is a measure of your weight related to your height.
To calculate your BMI, you divide your weight (in kilograms) by the square of your height (in metres). So, for example, if you weigh 70 kg and are 1.75 metres tall, your BMI is 70/(1.75 x 1.75), which is 22.9.
If you do not have scales at home, your practice nurse can measure your height, weigh you and calculate your BMI.
There are different categories of obesity as follows:
Ideal (normal) BMI is 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2.
Ideal (normal) BMI is 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2.
A BMI of 25-29.9 kg/m2 is overweight.
A BMI of 25-29.9 kg/m2 is overweight.
A BMI of 30-34.9 kg/m2 is obese (Grade I).
A BMI of 30-34.9 kg/m2 is obese (Grade I).
A BMI of 35-39.9 kg/m2 is obese (Grade II).
A BMI of 35-39.9 kg/m2 is obese (Grade II).
A BMI of ≥40 kg/m2 is obese (Grade III) or morbidly obese.
A BMI of ≥40 kg/m2 is obese (Grade III) or morbidly obese.
The more overweight you are, the more the risk to your health. For people with obesity (Grade III), weight is a serious and imminent threat to health. Broadly, the health risks increase the higher the BMI. However, for those who have overweight or obesity (Grade I), waist circumference is also taken into account to calculate the risk to health.
On the whole, BMI is a good estimate of how much of your body is made up of fat. However, BMI may be less accurate in very muscular people. This is because muscle weighs heavier than fat. So, someone who is very muscular may have a relatively high BMI due to the weight of their muscle bulk but actually have a proportionally low and healthy amount of body fat.
Standard BMI measurements also can't be used in people who have had amputations
In some people, particularly people from South Asian, Chinese, other Asian, Middle Eastern, Black African or African-Caribbean ethnic backgrounds, health risks start at lower BMI measurements (about 2.5 kg/m2 less than those given above). The relationship between health risks and BMI is also more complicated in older people.
Waist-to-height ratio
We know that where you carry fat is also important. Fat around the tummy (abdomen) is closely linked with health risks. Measuring the height-to-weight ratio gives an indication of how much of this fat is present, and can also give extra information about your risk of developing health problems (particularly cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes). This can be particularly useful in people with a BMI lower than 35 kg/m2, and also in people with high muscle mass, where BMI is less reliable.
The waist to height ratio is calculated by:
Measuring your waist. This should be done by using a tape measure, wrapped around your waist at the level of your belly button.

Dividing your waist measurement by your height measurement. (You can use either inches or centimetres, as long as you use the same for both measurements.)
Dividing your waist measurement by your height measurement. (You can use either inches or centimetres, as long as you use the same for both measurements.)
A waist-to-height ratio of 0.4 to 0.49 is healthy. A waist-to-height ratio between 0.5 to 0.59 indicates increased health risks, and above 0.6 indicates even higher health risks.
You should try to keep your waist circumference to less than half of your height - which is a waist-to-height ratio of 0.5 or less.t
For people with overweight, or obesity (Grade I), waist circumference is taken into account with BMI when assessing health risk. If you have a very high waist circumference, you may have a very high level of risk to your health even at the lower grades of obesity. If you have other medical conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, or coronary heart disease, your risks are even higher. Weight loss is even more crucial.
What are the health risks of obesity?
General health and lifestyle
Around a quarter to a third of schoolchildren are overweight or obese according to a House of Commons report. These alarming figures have led governments to introduce policies to get children fitter and healthier, such as a sugar tax on soft drinks and restrictions on the promotion of sugary, fatty foods. This may be great on a national basis but what should you do if your own child is overweight? Is it best to raise the topic and risk hurting their feelings, or should you ignore your child's expanding waistline but worry in silence about their future health and well-being?

Many people can also develop psychological problems because of having overweight or obesity. For example: low self-esteem; not liking how you look (poor self-image); low confidence; feelings of isolation. These feelings may affect your relationships with family members and friends and, if they become severe, may lead to depression.
Having obesity can also affect your overall life expectancy: you are more likely to die at a younger age. An analysis of all relevant studies in 2014 showed that you are significantly more likely to die younger if you have a BMI of 35 or more.
Another analysis showed that if you are a woman with a BMI of 30 or more at the age of 40, you are likely to die 7.1 years earlier than average. If you are a man with a BMI of 30 or more at the age of 40, you are likely to die 5.8 years earlier than average. If you smoke as well, your life expectancy is reduced even further.
How many people have obesity in the UK?
Obesity and being overweight are common. According to 2021 government reports, in England:
59 out of every 100 women had overweight or obesity.
59 out of every 100 women had overweight or obesity.
69 out of every 100 men were overweight or obesity.
69 out of every 100 men were overweight or obesity.
This means most people in England have overweight or obesity. Figures in the rest of the UK are similar. The UK now has the highest rate of obesity in Western Europe. The number of people with obesity in the UK has been rising rapidly over a period of 30 years. This has been called the obesity epidemic. It is estimated that obesity costs the NHS over £6.1 billion every year.
Causes of obesity
In some respects, the cause sounds quite simple. Your weight depends on how much energy you take in (the calories in food and drink) and how much energy your body uses (burns) up:
If the amount of calories that you eat equals the amount of energy that your body uses up, your weight remains stable.
If the amount of calories that you eat equals the amount of energy that your body uses up, your weight remains stable.
If you eat more calories than you burn up, you put on weight. The excess energy is converted into fat and stored in your body.
If you eat more calories than you burn up, you put on weight. The excess energy is converted into fat and stored in your body.
If you eat fewer calories than you burn up, you lose weight. Your body has to tap into its fat stores to get the extra energy it needs.
If you eat fewer calories than you burn up, you lose weight. Your body has to tap into its fat stores to get the extra energy it needs.
However, there is increasing evidence that this explanation, sometimes called the calories-in/calories-out model, is outdated. Research shows that there are many complex interactions that go on inside the body that work together to keep body weight the same. These interactions involve connections between the nerves and the brain and several hormones, including insulin. The medical term for this is homeostatic feedback. For example:
If you eat fewer calories, not only does this make you hungry but it also reduces the amount of energy that your body uses, that is, eating less makes you less active.
If you eat fewer calories, not only does this make you hungry but it also reduces the amount of energy that your body uses, that is, eating less makes you less active.
If you exercise, this is followed by a period of increased hunger, that is, doing more makes you eat more. Exercise also makes you tired, so you reduce the amount of energy your body uses later on.
If you exercise, this is followed by a period of increased hunger, that is, doing more makes you eat more. Exercise also makes you tired, so you reduce the amount of energy your body uses later on.
If you eat more calories, this increases the amount of energy your body uses, that is, eating more may make you more active.
If you eat more calories, this increases the amount of energy your body uses, that is, eating more may make you more active.
In other words the body adjusts how much energy you use up depending on how many calories you eat.
What seems to be important in making us obese is that particular foods can easily over-ride these natural feedback mechanisms for keeping us the same weight. High-sugar and high-fat foods taste great and give us pleasure; by triggering the 'reward' centre in our brain, they may be especially good at over-riding these controls. Ultra-processed foods tend to be high-fat and high-sugar and have been linked to obesity.
Foods can be divided into three types (although most foods are a mixture):
Carbohydrates:
Found mainly in fruit, vegetables, beans, grains and milk.
'Refined carbohydrates' are carbohydrates that have been processed in some way, such as table sugar (sucrose), high-fructose corn syrup (found in many processed foods), white flour, and pasta.

Refined carbohydrates, fructose and sugar-sweetened drinks have been linked with low levels of feeling full (satiety), difficulty controlling our appetite and a lack of excess energy to make up for the extra calories consumed.
How much you eat and drink
Most people in the UK live where tasty food can be found at almost any time of day or night. Many of the foods that people eat are those higher in calories (particularly fatty and sugary foods), so-called energy-dense foods. Although your body gives you a feeling of fullness after eating enough (satiety), you can easily ignore this feeling if you are enjoying tasty foods. Food portion sizes in general have increased.
There has also been a tendency to eat out more over recent years. If you eat out, you are more likely to eat food that is more energy-dense than you would eat at home. The amount of processed foods and ready-made meals available has also increased in response to our busy lives. These are often foods that are more energy-dense as well. However, even healthy foods contain calories and can tip the energy balance if we eat too much of them.
What you drink is also important. Alcohol and sugary drinks contain a lot of calories. Even fresh fruit juices that you may think are healthy can contribute to weight gain. This is thought to be due to the quick release of sugar that they give because the fibre naturally found in fruits is destroyed by juicing them.
Your physical activity levels
Most people in the UK do not do enough physical activity. A lack of physical activity by many people is thought to be a major cause of the increase in obesity in recent years.
There is no doubt that exercise is good for us; it lowers our risks of heart disease and stroke, amongst others. However, there is debate, that unless we are doing a lot of exercise it may not always help with getting to a healthy weight.
Emotional eating
Many of us eat not because we need nutrition, but because of other things that we feel. For example, people might eat because they are feeling happy, or excited, or because they are bored, or upset. We sometimes use food as a reward or comfort, like ordering a takeaway at the end of a tough week. And for some people, eating is a way of coping with negative emotions, such as shame or sadness.
This usually leads to us eating more than we actually need, which can lead to weight gain.
Is obesity genetic?
You are more likely to have obesity if one of your parents has obesity, or both of your parents have obesity. This may partly be due to learning bad eating habits from your parents. But, some people inherit a tendency in their genes that makes them prone to overeat. So, for some people, part of the problem is genetic.
However, if you do inherit a tendency to overeat, it is not inevitable that you will have overweight or obesity. You can learn about the power of your appetite, and ways to resist it and be strict on what you eat. But you are likely to struggle more than most people where your weight is concerned. You may find it more difficult to stop yourself from gaining weight or to lose weight.
Scientists have started to identify genes which may be involved in obesity. This may help them find effective treatments in the future.
Medical problems
Very few people with obesity have a 'medical' cause for their obesity. For example, health conditions such as Cushing's syndrome and an underactive thyroid gland are rare causes of weight gain, until they are treated. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome may also have overweight or obesity. (See the separate leaflets called Cushing's syndrome, Underactive thyroid gland (Hypothyroidism) and Polycystic ovary syndrome for further details on these conditions.)
Some medicines such as steroids, some antidepressants, some treatments for epilepsy and diabetes, and the contraceptive injection may contribute to weight gain. If you give up smoking, your appetite may increase and, as a result, you may put on weight. People with low mood or depression may also have a tendency to eat more energy-dense 'comfort' foods and so gain weight.
What are the benefits of losing weight?
It is difficult to measure how much quality of life is improved if you lose some weight. Many people feel better and have more energy. Some people notice an improvement in their self-esteem. But there are also definite health benefits from losing some weight.
What is more, if your BMI is between 25 and 35, much of the health benefits come with losing the first 5-10% of your weight. (For example, if you weigh 90 kg and you lose 9 kg, this would be 10% of your original weight.) If your BMI is between 25 and 35, on average, if you reduce your weight by 10%:
You are much less likely to develop the health problems listed above, such as diabetes.
You are much less likely to develop the health problems listed above, such as diabetes.
If you already have problems such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, osteoarthritis, or diabetes, these are likely to improve. If you are taking medication for these problems, you may be able to take a reduced dose.

Your chance of dying at any given age is reduced. This is mainly because you are less likely to die from heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or obesity-related cancers.
Your chance of dying at any given age is reduced. This is mainly because you are less likely to die from heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or obesity-related cancers.
If your BMI is more than 35, you are more likely already to have health problems related to being overweight. You will probably need to lose between 15-20% of your original weight to have sustained improvements in these health problems and other health benefits.
How do I know if my weight is already affecting my health?
If you are worried that you have overweight or obesity, you should discuss this with your practice nurse or doctor. They may be able to determine if your weight is already affecting your health.
For example, they may start by checking whether you have any symptoms of coronary heart disease such as chest pains, particularly on exertion. They may also ask about any symptoms of osteoarthritis such as back pain or joint pains, or any symptoms of sleep apnoea. This happens when your breathing patterns are disturbed while you are sleeping, due to excess weight around your chest, neck and airways.
They may suggest some tests to screen for any underlying health problems that may be caused by your weight. For example, they may suggest:
A blood test for type 2 diabetes.
A blood test for type 2 diabetes.
A blood test to look at your cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
A blood test to look at your cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
A blood pressure check.
A blood pressure check.
Other blood tests are sometimes suggested to look for other problems such as an underactive thyroid gland or liver problems.
As mentioned above, quite often it can also be the case that if someone has overweight or obesity, this can lead to psychological problems. So, your doctor or nurse may also ask you questions to look for any signs of these.
Note: your doctor or practice nurse may also be a source of help if you would like to lose weight (see below).
What can help with weight loss?
Some people lose weight with a strict diet and exercise regime for a short period. However, as soon as their diet is over, they often go back to their old eating habits and their weight goes straight back on. Losing weight and then keeping it off need a change in your lifestyle for life. This includes such things as:
The type of food and drink that you normally buy.

See the separate leaflet called Weight loss (Weight reduction) for more details. Below is a brief summary of the principles in losing weight.
Tips for weight loss
Motivation is crucial
No weight loss plan will work unless you have a serious desire to lose weight. You need to be ready and motivated.
Monitor your current food intake
It is helpful to know exactly how much you currently eat. Keeping a detailed diary of everything that you eat and drink over an average week is more helpful.
Aim to lose weight gradually
It is best not to lose weight too fast. Aim to lose an average of 0.5 to 1 kg per week (about 1-2 lb per week).
Set clear goals with a realistic timescale
It is important to set a clear and realistic weight loss goal. As mentioned above, in most cases, health benefits can be gained from losing the first 5-10% of your weight.
Aim to eat a healthy balanced diet
Special diets which are often advertised are not usually helpful. This is because after losing weight, if your old eating habits remain, the weight often goes straight back on. It is usually not a special diet that is needed but changing to a healthy balanced diet, for good.
You will find a lot more information about this in the separate leaflet called Healthy eating. You can also read about the Mediterranean Diet which is increasingly being recommended to prevent cardiovascular disease.
Be careful about what you drink
Many people drink sweet drinks to quench their thirst when all they really need is water. Sugary drinks such as cola, tea and coffee with milk and sugar, milk, fruit juices, and alcoholic drinks, all contain calories. One of the easiest ways to cut back on calories is simply to drink water as your main drink.
Increase your physical activity levels
Ideally all adults should aim for two and a half hours of exercise a week. One way to do this is to do half an hour of moderate-intensity exercise in bouts of 10 minutes for five days of the week. Moderate physical activity includes: brisk walking, jogging, dancing, swimming, badminton, tennis, etc.
In addition, try to do more in your daily activities in your life which can help to burn calories. For example, use stairs instead of lifts, park further away from for the entrance to the supermarket, walk or cycle to work or school, etc. See the separate leaflet called Exercise and Physical Activity. This includes lots of tips on how to easily increase your levels of physical activity.
Monitor your behaviour and progress
It can be helpful to keep a food diary and it is also important to weigh yourself once a week. Don't be disappointed if you put on a little or your weight loss levels off for a few days. Look at the overall pattern over several months.
Get help and support
Some people may feel motivated enough and are able to lose weight without any help. However, others need the support of a professional or a weight loss group.
You can find a lot more information and helpful tips in the separate leaflet called Weight loss (Weight reduction).
Treatment with medication to help with weight loss
Medication to help with weight loss may be an option for some people who want to lose weight. However, there are no wonder medicines available. Lifestyle changes to improve diet and increase physical activity are still important.
There are four medicines available in the UK to help with weight loss: orlistat, liraglutide (Saxenda®), semaglutide (Wegovy®), and tirzepatide (Mounjaro®).
Orlistat
Orlistat is available in the UK on prescription from your doctor and low-dose orlistat is also available to buy over the counter in pharmacies. It stops some of the fat you eat being absorbed into your body. Because the fat passes on through the gut with your stools (faeces), this can cause some unpleasant side-effects.
You can have the same weight loss effect by not eating the fat in the first place, so it is not a miracle cure. Doctors and pharmacists are given specific guidelines on when orlistat should be used. The separate leaflet called Orlistat (Weight Loss Medicine) gives further details.
Liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide
Liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide are all newer medicines that can be used to help with weight loss. They are called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists.
These come as injections. There has been a lot of interest in them in the last few years as they have been in the media a lot. Evidence shows that they do help with weight loss whilst using them, although weight gain may happen when they are stopped. For this reason, it's best to use them alongside other things, such as sustainable diet and exercise changes.
Semaglutide and liraglutide can only be prescribed on the NHS through specialist weight management clinics. Tirzepatide might be prescribable by GPs in the future, although at present this has not been rolled-out, and most GPs do not have access to it. It is likely that, when it becomes available, it will initially only be available for people with more severe obesity (eg BMI of 35 kg/m2 or more) that is also causing major health problems. Eligibility criteria may later become wider on the NHS, but it's not possible to say if or when that will happen yet.
Semaglutide, liraglutide, and tirzepatide are all available privately (from pharmacies and private doctors) as well. If you do buy them, be sure that they are prescribed by a healthcare professional - fake versions of these medications have been sold illegally, which may cause serious harm.
Bariatric surgery
This may be an option if you have obesity and your health is at risk. It may be particularly considered if you have type 2 diabetes. This is because it will have even more health benefits, as the surgery may cure your diabetes as well. However, surgery is usually only offered if you have already tried other ways to lose weight which have not worked (including diet, increasing your physical activity levels and orlistat).
Surgery usually has very good results and most people do lose a lot of weight. However, this is specialist surgery and it is a major undertaking. Surgeons work in specialist weight management teams. The team helps with all the aspects of weight loss, and all the possible ways of helping you. Surgery to help weight loss is called bariatric surgery. For more information, including the risks to consider, see the separate leaflet called Weight Loss Surgery.
Keeping the weight off
Many people lose weight but at the end of their diet, the weight goes back on. The only way to keep the weight off is to change the lifestyle that led to your weight gain in the first place. See the separate leaflet called Weight Loss (Weight Reduction).
If you've lost a lot of weight but are left with a lot of excess skin and fat on the lower part of your stomach (abdomen) you may want to consider a cosmetic procedure called a 'tummy tuck' (abdominoplasty). This is usually not available on the NHS, and so most people who want one will need to pay for it privately.
Can obesity be prevented?
Yes. You can help to prevent developing obesity or overweight by:
Following the healthy eating guidelines outlined above.

Vitamin D deficiency happens when your body does not have enough vitamin D, a nutrient that helps keep bones, teeth, and muscles healthy. It is common, especially in people who get little sunlight or have low dietary intake. Without enough vitamin D, bones can become weak, soft, or painful. This leaflet explains what causes it, what it means for your health, and what you can do to prevent and treat it.

Key points
Vitamin D is essential for bone and muscle function. A deficiency increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures in adults, and can cause rickets (soft, deformed bones) in children. It also supports the immune and nervous systems.

What is vitamin D deficiency?
Vitamin D deficiency means that there is a lack of vitamin D in your body to stay healthy. Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium and phosphorus from your gut (bowel) which is essential for healthy bones and to let your muscles function properly.
The main source of Vitamin D is sunlight, you can also get it from foods - particularly fortified ones - and vitamin D supplements.
Vitamin D is converted to an active form in the liver and kidneys. Some types of liver and kidney disease can affect the way the body handles vitamin D, and so can also cause vitamin D deficiency.
Vitamin D also plays a role in the nervous system and immune system.
Why is vitamin D important?
Getting enough vitamin D is crucial for healthy bones and teeth. In children, being deficient in vitamin D can lead to a condition called rickets, where the bones are weak and soft and can become deformed (for example, with bow legs). In adults, low levels of vitamin D can increase the risk of osteoporosis, or thinning of the bones. This increases the risks of breaking a bone.
Vitamin D may also play a role in:
Improving muscle strength.

How much vitamin D do I need a day?
Due to a lack of sunlight, it is recommended that everyone in the UK over 1 year old take 10 micrograms (400 International Units) a day from October to March.
Certain groups of people are at higher risk of low vitamin D. It's advised that people take a vitamin D supplement of 10 micrograms (400 International Units) a day all year round if they:
Are pregnant or breastfeeding.

In addition, specialists may advise taking a supplement all year round for people with particular gut (bowel), kidney or liver diseases.
Babies from birth to 1 year old should have a supplement in the form of vitamin D drops of 8.5 to 10 micrograms a day. Babies having 500 ml or more of formula milk per day do not need supplements, as formula milk already has vitamin D added.
Where can I buy vitamin D supplements?
Vitamin D dietary supplements can be bought at pharmacies, supermarkets and online retailers. In the UK they are available on prescription to certain groups of people (usually those needing high doses, for example, with severe chronic kidney disease).
Vitamin D deficiency symptoms
Many people don’t notice any symptoms of vitamin D deficiency, or they might just feel a bit tired or achy. In children, however, signs are usually easier to spot.

Babies with severe vitamin D deficiency can get:
Cramps (muscle spasms).

These problems are related to low levels of calcium which result from the low levels of vitamin D.
Vitamin D deficiency symptoms in children
Children with severe vitamin D deficiency may have soft skull or leg bones. Their legs may look curved (bow-legged). They may also complain of bone pains, often in the legs, and muscle pains or muscle weakness. This condition is known as rickets.

Growing children, pregnant women, and breastfeeding women need extra vitamin D because it is required for growth. So, vitamin D deficiency is more likely to develop in the following groups of people:
Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Vitamin D deficiency is even more likely to develop in women who have had several babies with short gaps between pregnancies.

Breastfed babies whose mothers are lacking in vitamin D, or with prolonged breastfeeding, as there is little vitamin D in breast milk.
The body is unable to make enough vitamin D
This can occur for various reasons:
People who get very little sunlight on their skin are at risk of vitamin D deficiency. This is more of a problem in the more northerly parts of the world (including the UK) where there is less sun. In particular:
People who stay inside a lot, for example, those in hospital for a long time, or housebound people.
People who cover up a lot of their body when outside.
The strict use of sunscreen could increase the risk of vitamin D deficiency, particularly if high sun protection factor (SPF) creams (factor 15 or above) are used. However, this is a theoretical risk and there is no evidence that the normal use of sunscreen does actually cause vitamin D deficiency in real life. Everyone, especially children, should always be protected from the harmful effect of the sun's rays. See the separate leaflet called Sun and sunburn for more information.

Rarely, some people without any other risk factors or diseases become deficient in vitamin D. It is not clear why this occurs. It may be due to a subtle metabolic problem in the way vitamin D is made or absorbed. So, even some otherwise healthy, fair-skinned people who get enough sun exposure can become deficient in vitamin D.

Not enough dietary vitamin D
Vitamin D deficiency is more likely to occur in people who follow a strict vegetarian or vegan diet, or a non-fish-eating diet.
How common is vitamin D deficiency?
A lack of vitamin D is very common. One survey in the UK showed that about 1 in 5 adults and about 1 in 5 children in the UK have low vitamin D levels. More people have low vitamin D levels in the winter and spring because of less exposure to sunlight.
How is vitamin D deficiency diagnosed?
It may be suspected from someone's medical history, symptoms, or lifestyle. A simple blood test for vitamin D level can make the diagnosis. Blood tests for calcium and phosphate levels and liver function may also show changes linked to a low level of vitamin D.
Sometimes a wrist X-ray is done for a child in order to see how the bones are developing. This can assess how severe the problem is by looking for changes in the wrist bones. This is when vitamin D deficiency has already been identified and specialists are assessing its impact.
Vitamin D deficiency treatment
The main treatment is to take vitamin D supplements. This is a form of vitamin D called ergocalciferol or calciferol. The dose and the best treatment schedule will depend on the situation, age, severity of the deficiency, etc. Briefly, one of the following may be advised.
High-dose tablets or liquids
There are different strengths available and a dose may be taken either daily, weekly or monthly. This will depend on the situation and on which particular treatment guideline is being used. This high dose may often be temporary to increase the levels to normal and they can then be kept at this level with over-the-counter supplements.
Because vitamin D is a 'fat-soluble' vitamin, your body can store it, so you do not need to take it every day. This is different from water-soluble vitamins such as vitamin C, which you need to consume every day.
With high doses of vitamin D it is even more important to take the medicine correctly. The advantage of the higher-dose treatment is that the deficiency improves quickly, which is very important in growing children or people who have very low levels.
Standard-dose tablets or liquids
These are taken every day for about 12 months so that the body can catch up on the missing vitamin D. This is a rather slow method of replacing vitamin D, but is suitable for prevention.
Injection
A single small injection of vitamin D will last for about six months. This was previously used but is less so nowadays as there are increased risks of side effects, toxicity and tachyphylaxis (where the individual feels the need for more and more vitamin, even though their levels are normal).
Maintenance therapy
Once vitamin D deficiency has been treated, the body's stores of vitamin D have been replenished. After this, ongoing maintenance treatment is often needed long-term, to prevent further deficiency in the future.
This is because it is unlikely that any risk factor for vitamin D deficiency in the first place will have completely resolved. The dose needed for maintenance may be lower than that needed to treat the deficiency.
How to get vitamin D naturally
For people with fair skin, around 20-30 minutes of sunlight on the face and forearms around the middle of the day, 2-3 times a week is enough to make enough vitamin D in the summer months in the UK. The sunlight has to fall directly on to bare skin (through a window is not enough).
People with darker skin can still make some vitamin D through exposure to sunshine. However, they may not be able to make enough from sunshine and diet alone so should consider taking a vitamin D supplement all year round.
Too much exposure to the sun's rays can be damaging. Sunburn should be avoided at all costs (mainly because it can increase the risk of skin cancer).
Vitamin D can also be obtained from foods that either contain it naturally or have it added to them.
What foods contain vitamin D?
Most foods contain very little vitamin D naturally. Foods that naturally contain a source of vitamin D include:
Oily fish (such as sardines, pilchards, herring, trout, tuna, salmon, mackerel and kippers).

Egg yolk, red meat and liver.

Cod liver oil (although this should be avoided if you're pregnant).
Some foods are fortified with vitamin D (this means they have vitamin D added to them). These fortified foods include infant formula milk, most margarines and some cereals. It will be stated on the packaging.
In some countries (but not in the UK) all milk is fortified with vitamin D.
Are there any risks to taking vitamin D supplements?
Care is needed with vitamin D supplements in certain situations:
It can interact with certain medicines: digoxin (for an irregular heartbeat - atrial fibrillation) or thiazide diuretics such as bendroflumethiazide (commonly used to treat high blood pressure). In this situation, high doses of vitamin D may need to be avoided, and digoxin will need monitoring more closely.

Multivitamins are not suitable for long-term high-dose treatment because the vitamin A they also contain can be harmful in large amounts.
Complications of vitamin D deficiency
The complications of severe deficiency have been mentioned. Rickets can occur in children, and osteomalacia (softening of the bones) in adults. These diseases affect the strength and appearance of bones, and can lead to permanent bone deformities if untreated or if treatment is delayed.
As well as bone and muscle health, vitamin D deficiency is associated with a number of different conditions. These conditions include:
Diabetes.

Coronary heart disease.

Breast cancer.

Bowel cancer.

Alzheimer's disease.

The exact significance of these associations isn't yet properly understood.
What is the outlook?
The outlook (prognosis) of vitamin D deficiency is usually excellent. Both the vitamin levels and the symptoms usually respond well to treatment. However, it can take time (months) for bones to recover and for symptoms such as pain to improve.
Frequently asked questions
How long does it take to correct a vitamin D deficiency?
It usually takes a few weeks to several months to correct vitamin D deficiency, depending on how low your levels are, the dosage of supplements, and how consistently you take them.
Can you take too much vitamin D?
Taking more than the recommended daily amount of 10 micrograms (400 IU) can lead to vitamin D toxicity, which may cause high calcium levels, nausea, weakness, kidney problems, and other health issues. Always follow guidelines and seek medical advice before taking high doses.
Can I take vitamin D all year round?
Vitamin D supplements are generally safe to take year-round, especially if you don’t get enough from sunlight or diet. Most people benefit from a daily maintenance dose, but it’s best to follow official guidelines or your doctor’s advice to avoid taking too much.
Does a lack of vitamin D cause depression?
Low vitamin D has been linked to low mood and depression as the vitamin supports brain function and mood regulation. Whilst not everyone with a deficiency develops depression, maintaining healthy levels through sunlight, diet, or supplements may help support mental wellbeing.

How to stop smoking
This leaflet explains why smoking tobacco is so harmful. It also lists the benefits of stopping, and how to get help to stop.
Smoking facts and figures
Up to half of all smokers die from smoking-related diseases. About 100,000 people in the UK die each year due to smoking. Smoking-related deaths are mainly due to cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease (such as heart attacks) and stroke.
If you are a long-term smoker, on average, your life expectancy is about 10 years less than a non-smoker. Put another way, in the UK about 8 in 10 non-smokers live past the age of 70 but only about half of long-term smokers live past 70. The younger you are when you start smoking, the more likely you are to smoke for longer and to die early from smoking.
Many smoking-related deaths are not quick deaths. For example, if you develop COPD you can expect several years of illness and distressing symptoms (such as breathlessness) before you die.
Smoking increases the risk of developing a number of other diseases (listed below). Many of these may not be fatal but they can cause years of illness and unpleasant symptoms.
The good news
Stopping smoking can make a big difference to your health. It is never too late to stop smoking to greatly health benefit. For example, if you stop smoking in middle age, before having cancer or some other serious disease, you avoid most of the increased risk of death due to smoking.

Many people have given up smoking. In 1972 just under half of adults in the UK were smokers. By 1990 this had fallen to just under a third. At present, about a sixth of UK adults are smokers.

Chest and lungs
About 2 in 3 smokers want to stop smoking. Some people can give up easily. Willpower and determination are the most important aspects when giving up smoking. However, nicotine is a drug of addiction and many people find giving up a struggle. Help is available.

Why smoking is bad for you
Nicotine
Nicotine is is inhaled from the tobacco in cigarettes. It gets into the bloodstream and stimulates the brain. Nicotine is addictive.
If you are a regular smoker, when the blood level of nicotine falls, you usually develop withdrawal symptoms, such as:
Craving.

Anxiety.

Restlessness.

Just feeling awful.
Just feeling awful.
These symptoms are relieved by the next cigarette. This is the definition of nicotine addiction.
Most regular smokers are addicted to nicotine and smoke regularly to feel 'normal' and to prevent nicotine withdrawal symptoms.
Withdrawal symptoms begin within a few hours after having the last cigarette. If they are not relieved by the next cigarette, withdrawal symptoms become worse. If you do not smoke any more, the withdrawal symptoms peak after about 24 hours and then gradually ease over about 2-4 weeks.
About 2 in 3 of people who smoke want to stop smoking but, without help, many fail to succeed. The main reason why so few smokers succeed, even though they want to stop smoking, is because nicotine addiction is strong and difficult to break. However, many more succeed with support and the use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), electronic cigarettes or a smoking cessations medicine.

Tar which contains many chemicals
These deposit in the lungs and can get into the blood vessels and be carried to other parts of the body. Cigarette smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals, including over 50 known causes of cancer (carcinogens) and other poisons.
Carbon monoxide
This chemical affects the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. In particular, in pregnant women who smoke, this causes a reduced amount of oxygen to get to the growing baby. This is thought to be the most important cause for the bad effects of smoking on the growing baby.
What are the effects of smoking?
Lung cancer. About 30,000 people in the UK die from lung cancer each year. More than 8 in 10 cases are directly related to smoking.

COPD. About 25,000 people in the UK die each year from this serious lung disease. More than 8 in 10 of these deaths are directly linked to smoking. People who die of COPD are usually quite unwell for several years before they die.

Heart disease. This is the biggest killer illness in the UK. About 120,000 people in the UK die each year from heart disease. About 1 in 6 of these is due to smoking. Recent UK research shows smoking even one cigarette a day is associated with major risks of heart disease or stroke - see Further Reading below.

Other cancers - of the mouth, nose, throat, larynx, gullet (oesophagus), pancreas, bladder, neck of the womb (cervix), blood (leukaemia) and kidney are all more common in smokers.

Circulation. The chemicals in cigarettes can damage the lining of the blood vessels and affect the level of fats (lipids) in the bloodstream. This increases the risk of atheroma forming (sometimes called hardening of the arteries). Atheroma is the main cause of heart disease, strokes, poor circulation in the legs (peripheral arterial disease) and swollen arteries which can burst causing internal bleeding (aneurysms). All these atheroma-related diseases are more common in smokers.

Buerger's disease causes inflammation of blood vessels, particularly in the hands and feet. It occurs mainly in smokers. It leads to narrowing and blockage of the blood vessels, causing pain. It may eventually lead to damage and death of the tissues in the hands and/or feet.

Sexual problems. Men who smoke are more likely than non-smokers to have erection problems (impotence) or have difficulty in maintaining an erection in middle life. This is thought to be due to smoking-related damage of the blood vessels to the penis.

Contraception. Women who smoke and are 35 or over cannot use contraceptives that contain oestrogen, because the risks of stroke are so much higher. Their choice of contraception is therefore reduced.

How does smoking affect other people?
Children, non-smoking adults and unborn babies can all be affected by your smoke.
Children who live in a household with a smoker are more likely to have various health problems than children who don't. You don't even have to be smoking in the room or vehicle while a child is present, for them to be harmed by your smoke.
Learn more about smoking and others in the separate leaflet called Passive Smoking.
Other problems with smoking
Your breath, clothes, hair, skin and home smell of stale tobacco. You do not notice the smell if you smoke; however, to non-smokers the smell is obvious and unpleasant.

How to stop smoking
The most important thing to do is to decide for yourself that this is something you want to do. The majority of smokers want to stop. Some do so easily but for others it's a real struggle, as smoking is very addictive.
There are lots of different things out there available to help you to stop:
Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).
