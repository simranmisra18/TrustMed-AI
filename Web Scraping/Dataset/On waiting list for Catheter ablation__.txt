Hi there,
I have been diagnosed with WPW (wolf parkinson white syndrome) and have been told today by my consultant that I require catheter ablation. He was very reassuring telling me how there is minimal risk and I could either have general anesthetic or local with sedation. My question is…has anyone had it? how was it? I definitely do not want general anesthetic and I would prefer to do it without sedation as I hate the way it makes me feel. I told the consultant this and he said I would be fine without it. Is this true? has anyone had it without sedation? When I have looked online it is mainly american sites which seem to make it out to be a big procedure where general anesthetic is a must but my consultant said it is a painless procedure (except for the local anesthetic needle) so why would I need sedation? any words of wisdom or stories welcome (good and bad!) thanks in advance.
