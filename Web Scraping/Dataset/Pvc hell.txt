Hey Catherine, you’re not alone. i work as a Paramedic for a living and pvcs have ruined my life. i have had them since i was like 18 but over the last couple years I can’t function without fear that I’ll get a bad run of them that will take me out. i hate how Doctors are generally dismissive of them. I have not quality of life and feel like a complete loser. Hope you’re feeling better.
