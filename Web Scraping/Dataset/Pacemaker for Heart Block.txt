I’ve just had a pacemaker fitted for Mobitz type 2 Heart Block. Shock discovery following a period of breathlessness and Fitbit showing heartbeat of 30 beats per min! Any advice?

I had a pacemaker fitted a year ago after similar issues also long pauses of heartbeat > 7 seconds during the night. Like you it was quite a surprise. I didn’t like the Pacemaker fitting experience one bit… all a bit traumatic.
It has taken me about a year to come to terms with the whole episode, so I think have faith in your cardiac team and the pacing team. The pacing teams are really amazing in their knowledge. When I went for my first pacing checkup it sounded so futuristic - their jargon. Don’t be afraid to talk to them or your GP if you are worried about anything, rather than burden yourself.
