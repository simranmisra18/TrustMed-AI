Hello, I couldn’t find a Hypertension group, so I am hoping this group will be knowledgeable about hypertension.
I was diagnosed with hypertension several weeks ago following two readings at my GP surgery, second of which was 150, first slightly higher. I was put on 5 mg Amlodipine, which gave me unpleasant side effects, and I stopped it after five days. I asked to be allowed to try propranolol, which I’d taken before for anxiety and which I had no bad side effects with. GP said it wasn’t usually prescribed for high BP but I could try it.
After about six weeks, my BP is pretty normal in the morning, but later in afternoon it goes up to 150-160. I can bring it down with half an hour’s exercise. I’m totally confused about whether the high reading is the important things, or whether it’s the daily average that’s more important (in which case I’m not doing too badly). However the GP diagnosed me after two readings at the same visit, which makes me think it is the individual number that is more important??
Additionally, I have read online about different methods of taking BP. Some people seem to take two readings and go by the second; some take an average; some take three, etc. I am confused as to how you ever really know your correct BP. Even a 24 monitor could presumably catch you on a stressful day?
Many thanks for any advice/clarification!

i too have high BP. i take amlodopine and candesartan and most recently my GP allowed me to take Propranolol too. I feel my blood pressure is primarily an anxiety issue.
Unfortunately that involves really bad health anxiety and i have a terrible fear of actually taking my bp reading. When i do though i do take the best of 3 readings but like you dont know if this is correct.
Sorry i cant be much help to you but will follow this thread and hope we can both get some advice

Your blood pressure is best read after 10 min of inactivity. High blood pressure at a resting heart rate is problematic. Your blood pressure will fluctuate throughout the day. Before talking to a doctor it’s most beneficial to have 3 readings per day morning, noon, and night. Make sure you’re sitting up straight, feet flat on the ground, breathing normally, and at least 5 min of inactivity. Record these readings for two weeks. Most BP devices save the readings in memory so you can bring in the device into the doctors office if it’s more convenient. Plus the nurse can check your machine against there’s to see if they need to fudge your numbers for accuracy.
