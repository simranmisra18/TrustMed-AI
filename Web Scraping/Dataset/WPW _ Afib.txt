Hi,
I’ve had WPW since I was 39 …I take metoprolol for it …it does and doesn’t help …now that I’m older I’m experiencing Afib too …which is terrifying because of the possibilty of clots/strokes …I’m starting to think about an ablation …does anyone have a similiar situation…and what worked for you …thank you!

My WPW caused Afib at the age of 23. It made my heart rate go to 300 bpm. I was in the hospital for a while. I had to get an ablation. So yes, I would recommend getting an ablation.
