I had a bad SVT episode recently where it kept flipping in and out, with lots of PVCs. It turned out my potassium was pretty low (3.2). After a potassium IV in the hospital, I was sent home on metoprolol ER to use while getting my potassium back up. Normally my SVT has been very manageable, so the plan was just short term until things stabilized.
I was on 23.75 mg daily, then started taking half (so about 11.9mg once a day) for about 4weeks now. The problem is, whenever I try to stop completely, the next day I seem to get a rough SVT episode. It honestly feels like coming off makes the SVT worse, which is scary. Since lowering my dose aswell my pvcs have been extremely bad, way worse than anything ive ever experienced before.
My potassium is stable now, and I really want to stop because I was doing fine before, but metoprolol feels like it’s blunting how my body usually responds to my heart.
I’m not asking for medical advice, just curious if anyone else with SVT has come off metoprolol ER and what their experience was like, thank you!
