I have been diagnosed with WPW (wolf parkinson white syndrome) and have been told today by my consultant that I require catheter ablation. He was very reassuring telling me how there is minimal risk and I could either have general anesthetic or local with sedation. My question is…has anyone had it? how was it? I definitely do not want general anesthetic and I would prefer to do it without sedation as I hate the way it makes me feel. I told the consultant this and he said I would be fine without it. Is this true? has anyone had it without sedation? When I have looked online it is mainly american sites which seem to make it out to be a big procedure where general anesthetic is a must but my consultant said it is a painless procedure (except for the local anesthetic needle) so why would I need sedation? any words of wisdom or stories welcome (good and bad!) thanks in advance.

Hi Rebecca,
I’m also on the waiting list for ablation ,I went to see my cardiologist on the 5th Dec, he said I could be sedated or general anaesthetic, he said with sedation some patients still can’t tolerate it so I’ve opted to go to sleep ,everyone is different though ,go with what feels right for you.
