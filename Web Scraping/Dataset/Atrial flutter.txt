i was diagnosed six weeks ago with atrial flutter .
was put on Edoxaban 60mg & Verapamil 240 mg
My heartrate went down pretty quickly but is now rising ocationally again to as high as 147 .
ive also developed ,dizzinness ,breathlessness,nausea/sickness & itchy body all over like somethjng is crawing over my skin .
can anyone tell me if they have these symptoms and if so are the part of the condition or side effects of the medication .
I just dont feel right at all .
