Why am I having chest pain even after 3 days of drinking alcohol? While climbing up the stairs also, it hurts in both sides. I have hypertension but the pressure is within range. I have been drinking water enough to keep me hydrated. Last time when I drink around 6 months ago, it happened the same. I had ECG, Echo tested and everything was fine. I am also taking amlodipine, losartan and pantoprazole for gastritis.

If you are experiencing the same symptoms as previously, it suggests your body (heart?) has an issue with alcohol. I’m not medically qualified (but have an extensive cardiac history) and 2 possibles spring to mind - cardiomyopathy and/or pancreatitis. Are you a regular drinker, if so - stop drinking?
My cardiologist recommended 2.5 - 3 litres per day of water to maintain proper hydration/fluid levels.
when you say BP is within range, what do you mean?
