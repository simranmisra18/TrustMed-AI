Hi, ive been waking up in the middle of the night with what feels like a racing heart but my hr is between 80-106… The rhythm feels like my heart is twitching or beating super super fast but a steady beat… Can anyone tell me if it sounds like AFib because ive got myself into a panic and now havent slept or hardly eaten in days. Thanks
