A week ago I had burning at top of my penis head after urinating not during but after pee would touch the tip. It went on for about 3 days then it stopped being intense I didn’t burn as before barely any sensation. Went to get std tested came back negative went to get cultural blood no infections or bacteria. But also noticed at the meatus looks a little bit irritated. Any one have an idea of what it could be. ?
