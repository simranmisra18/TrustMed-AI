I was told by my family doctor to stop taking the metoprolol and that I could just stop it cold turkey. I questioned him about it because I thought you could not do that. He said it would be all right. Now after reading about the danger of stopping it cold turkey, I’m really worried that I will have a heart attack. Should I get back on it and then try to wean myself off of it?
