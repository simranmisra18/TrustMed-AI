My dad has hereditary hypertension. During the last year he lost some weight (185 lb to 165 lb). For reference, his height is 5 feet seven inches. He was not severely overweight but I noticed his belly fat reduced a lot.
As a result, his blood pressure went down, and his medication needed to be adjusted. He follows a mediteranean diet (plenty of vegetables, olive oil, fish, rarely meat and maybe fewer carbohydrates and sweets compared to previous years) and he takes vitamin D supplements.

Rauwolfia Serpentina mother tincture 10 drops in 1/4th cup water three times a day. Very effective. It’s homeopathic medicine

At least any dehydration worries will be alleviated.
Homeopathy is NOT treatment.

Your BP is maintaining 115/75
You are also taking water.
At least you are hydrating.
