Ive not eaten for 17 days now my gp is worried and was saying that I will be sectioned if I carry on and prescribed me fortisip for the weekend but the pharmacy wont have them in until Monday and it sounds bad but im glad they won’t have it in until then because im petrified of fortisip and I am scared of when I see my gp next week cause I really cant eat anything im too scared too
But I think they are over reacting and I think i am ok I feel in control of this, i was forced to go a&e the other day and dont think I needed to be there either I just dont get why everyone is freaking out.

What were your favourite foods? Start with a bit of them first? You have to eat! No wonder they’re all freaking out, your health is at risk, please try some morsels at least

Unless you are grossly obese, I can’t see the purpose of why you are fasting. Even then, a fast of an extended duration should be medically supervised. I can understand why you are afraid to return to food but for a different reason. If you have not eaten for that length of time, solid food can put your body into shock. Your doctor has provided you with fortisip for this very reason. Fortisip will provide much needed nutrients and allow a gradual return to solid food. You might want to discuss whether a hospital stay would be a good idea here. I do not know if you have control issues or feel the need to deprive yourself of food. Your doctor is clearly very concerned about your physical and mental wellbeing. I would suggest you work with him to find the best path forward.
