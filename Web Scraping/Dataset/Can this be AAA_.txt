So i noticed when my daughter (1 yr) sat on my belly when we were playing, i got a weird deep pain that radiates into my lower spine, if that makes sense. When I press a certain spot near the right side of my bellybutton I can feel that pain. I can also feel the pulsing of the aorta and it feels hard around the left side of that area. I went to the doctor and she pressed around and listened and wasn’t too concerned. It wasn’t until after my appointment that I read about this, or I would have asked her. maybe I am just paranoid googling about it, but I’m worried about a rupture now
