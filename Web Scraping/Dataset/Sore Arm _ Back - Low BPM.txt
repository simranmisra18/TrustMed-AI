For two weeks now I have been dealing with a sore upper left arm and upper back. My BP is slight higher then normal (normal: 135/90, now: 145/95) and my normally low heart rate is a bit lower (normal: 60. now: 55) and I have dizzy spells. Received full level of testing at hospital ER (blood tests, 2 EKG, chest x-ray, cardiac CTA) and all results didn’t find any issues. This issue gets better some days but comes back the next day. Getting up to move around usually helps improve symptoms. What is this problem-?
