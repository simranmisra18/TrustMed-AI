I'm a 27 year old female. I've had PVCS for nearly 10 months. My doctor told me that its perfectly normal and nothing to worry about. She told me to manage my anxiety and don't consume caffeine. A few months later, I started getting them more frequently and lasting much longer. I had less stress and anxiety and no caffeine, but this time I was getting nauseous, dizzy, shortness of breath and very fatigued during them. I talked to my doctor once again telling her about the new symptoms. She got really irritated with me and told me that there is nothing wrong with me. I talked to new doctor for a second opinion and told him about my PVCS. He immediately got angry with me and told me that I was fine. Is this a normal thing and I'm just being overly concerned?

Hey
I’ve had similar with PVCs/ectopic beats. I’m 33, had symptoms for 18 months +
when i have an “episode” it makes me feel quite tired, and I notice my breathing more… taking deeper breaths. Have had lots of lightheaded-ness too. Along with other symptoms
I cut out all caffeine and fizzy drinks, I tried eating healthier, tried breathing exercises and none of it made a difference.
I had to speak to 5 doctors until i got to speak to a specialist as each doctor told me I was fine.
I still feel like there is something else they’ve not picked up on yet so I’m saving up to book with a private specialist.
I would say… you know your body, if you don’t feel right definitely talk to someone.
Find another doctor if you can, try and see a specialist, someone who sees these symptoms every day.
But also remember the doctors you’ve seen have done plenty of checks so there is nothing immediately concerning to your health.
I hope your symptoms pass soon

I’m a Paramedic and have suffered from bouts of PVCs, NSVT, SVT and runs of A-fib. After exhausting testing they all said I’m fine. The PVCs scare the crap out of me and now I suffer from severe health anxiety and panic attacks. Doctors in general are not great at dealing with patient fears when they have these problems. You’d think I’d have a better understanding of this condition because of my job but it’s the exact opposite. Stay strong and don’t let it run your life. You’re still here!

hi sorry to bother you i was just wondering if you could share what your NSVT feels like? i too suffer from PVCs and im scared that i also have short runs of NSVT but not sure. my palpitations can be like a pause then a thud, a pause then 2 thuds, 2 or 3 thuds then a pause. sometimes multiple, some times feel just a double beat without any pauses and fluttering. It’s taking over my life. I hope you find some relief from them Take care.
