I just walked 2 miles at a moderately fast pace. No pvc’s during the walk, but 10 minutes after the pvc’s were very frequ ent and scary. I am 73 and have been bothered by pvc’s for many years, but now they occur every day and only go away when walking fairly fast. I have gerd and hypertension. Walking is the only real answer to my hypertension, so do not want to give that up, but the skips, flutters, and pauses go on all day and I wonder if heart muscle is compromised in some way.Due to see primary doctor in 2 weeks, but since I had an echo stress test over 2years ago, and it just showed many pac’s and pvc’s, he does not seem concerned.Does anyone have a similar experience?
