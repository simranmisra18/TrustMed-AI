After an Apple Watch alert that I was in Afib, I was diagnosed with SVT (seriously, I thought I was just having mini panic attacks!). I’m currently on a low dose of metoprolol tartrate which has helped somewhat. I’ve increased my exercise routine and diet (metoprolol caused a 10lb weight gain!). Because I’ve experienced Afib three times over the past year, I’m seeing a cardiac electrophysiologist next month. Has anyone here dealt with a similar situation? What are your coping tips? I tend to fall into the gutter of despair when faced with health issues.
