Febrile seizure
A fever occurs when the body temperature is higher than normal. Normal body temperature varies a little, but a temperature above 38°C is considered a fever. Sometimes the upper range of normal is considered to be 37.5°C or 37.8°C - for consistency, this article will use 38°C as the cut-off for a high temperature.
This article is specifically regarding fever in children.

The actual level of the temperature in fever is not a good guide to how severely ill a child is once they are older than 6 months.
Fever associated with common, self-limiting viral infections such as a cold typically causes a temperature that rises and falls over a total of 12-72 hours. Children often complain of feeling cold at the start of a fever. They may look pale and feel shivery, yet will feel hot and dry to the touch. Later they often say they feel hot, and will be sweaty and flushed.
How to measure a child's temperature
Forehead strip thermometers are not very accurate. Ideally you should use one of the following to measure your child's temperature:
Under 4 weeks old, with an electronic thermometer in the armpit.

Between 4 weeks and 5 years old:

With a chemical dot thermometer in the armpit.
With a digital thermometer designed to be placed in the ear.

When should you go to the doctor?
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced guidelines aimed to help healthcare professionals assess children with fever. These can also be useful to parents.
They look at the symptoms seen in children with fever and allocate them to categories of 'green', 'amber' and 'red'. They are shown in the table below.
Green symptoms are reassuring. They mean that your child's symptoms suggest they are at low risk of serious illness.
Amber symptoms suggest that you need a doctor's advice. They suggest that your child might be at slightly increased risk of more serious illness.
Red symptoms suggest that you need urgent medical advice. They suggest that your child's symptoms could indicate a serious illness, needing emergency help.
Not all possible symptoms are included in the guidance - for instance, tummy (abdominal) pain is not mentioned and, unless it is mild, it usually does need assessing by a doctor.
Some of the guidance concerns the kind of symptoms which a trained healthcare professional is expected to assess but which you may feel uncomfortable trying to measure, such as number of breaths per minute (respiratory rate) and heart rate (which usually needs a stethoscope for accurate assessment in a small child).
They are included here for completeness: if ANY red or amber signs are present you should seek medical help; you do not need all of them to be present in order to do so.

Most fevers in children over 6 months of age are not serious and are a very common occurrence with coughs, colds and all the other common childhood illnesses. However, fever is also seen in more serious illnesses and the red or amber signs above can help to differentiate between these.
Fever in children aged 3-6 months is less common and it is important to seek medical advice if the temperature is 39°C or more.
Fever in a baby aged less than 3 months is unusual and worrying. You should seek medical advice if the temperature is 38°C or more; the GP is often an appropriate place to start, but if there is a true fever in a child aged less than 3 months, you will probably also be referred to a paediatrician on the same day.
Causes of fever in children
The most common causes of fever in children in the UK are viral infections. There are many other uncommon causes. Some of these will show other obvious signs.
Infections with viruses are the most common cause. Viral infections cause many common illnesses such as colds, coughs, flu, diarrhoea, etc. Sometimes viral infections can cause more serious illnesses. Viruses are also the most common causes of sore throat, ear infections etc.

Infections with bacteria are much less common than viral infections but also cause fevers. Bacteria are more likely to cause serious illness such as pneumonia, joint infections (septic arthritis), urine infections, kidney infections, septicaemia and meningitis. However, bacteria can also cause fever in less serious infections such as ear infections and infected skin rashes.

Inflammatory conditions and reactions may cause fever, including Kawasaki disease, some types of arthritis, and reactions to some medicines.

Immunisations: sometimes children develop a fever after an immunisation. This is because immunisations are generally designed to 'trick' the body's immune system into thinking it sees an infection, so that it develops immunity. Fevers following immunisation are not usually high or prolonged.

Heat stroke is a possible cause of raised body temperature, although technically this isn't a fever, as the body is being heated from the outside (whereas in fever the body does the heating itself).

Always inform your doctor if your child develops an unexplained fever within six months of visiting an area where malaria is present (endemic). This is the case even if your child has taken antimalarial medication.
Why do children get fevers?
Fever is a part of the body's natural defences against infection. Fever is created by the immune system under the direction of a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus acts like a central heating thermostat. Fever happens when the hypothalamus sets the body temperature above its normal level.
It does this in response to an infection because it detects the presence of infectious agents like bacteria or viruses. It is believed that the increased temperature is a protection the body has developed to help fight the germs that cause infections, as they tend to multiply best at normal body temperature.
How common is fever in children?
Fever and feverish illness are very common in young children, particularly in those aged less than 5 years. Three to four out of every 10 parents of children aged less than 5 years say their child has had a fever in the past year.
It is one of the most common reasons for a child being taken to the doctor. Fever is also the second most common reason for a child being admitted to hospital and it can be a cause of great anxiety in parents.
How is the cause of fever in children diagnosed?
The healthcare professional will try to work out why your child has a fever. This will usually include asking about your child's health and symptoms.
Your child may need to be examined (a 'face-to-face' consultation). In this case it is most likely that your child's temperature, pulse and breathing will be checked. Your child will be checked for lack of fluid in the body (dehydration) and their blood pressure may be taken.
A urine sample may be tested. Rarely, an ambulance may be called. This does not necessarily mean your child is very ill, only that they need to be assessed quickly in hospital.
Are further tests needed?
Usually the healthcare professional who assesses your child will decide that no further tests are necessary. This is usually because there are no worrying signs in your child's condition and your doctor or nurse feels able to diagnose the infection, based on their training and experience.
Occasionally, however, they are uncertain.
This may be because your child has some of the 'amber' or 'red' warning signs.

If this is the case you may be asked to go to the paediatric ward or Accident and Emergency department. If your child is very unwell an ambulance will be called. However, if that is not the case, and you are able, you may be asked to make your way there by car; in some cases this will be quicker than waiting for an ambulance.
On the ward your child is likely to have several tests done. These will vary, depending on how your child appears and on what the doctors find when they assess and examine your child.
They may include:

You may be discharged home from the hospital after this or, if doctors are still not certain that your child is at very low risk of a more serious condition, your child may be kept for observation or treatment.
What to do if a child has a fever/high temperature?
A child with a fever may look flushed and irritable and they may not feel like doing very much.
To help your child you should:
Make your child comfortable - details below.

You do not need to use paracetamol and ibuprofen if your child is comfortable and not distressed by the fever, aches or pains. Because fever is of benefit in getting rid of the underlying infection more quickly, if your child is not distressed by the fever, it is best to let it continue.
In most bouts of fever that are not caused by serious illness, the temperature generally comes down quickly. It is not unusual to see a child playing happily as soon as their temperature has come down. It is reassuring if a child improves as their temperature drops.
A child with a serious infection usually gets worse despite efforts to bring their temperature down. In addition, they may have other worrying symptoms - for example, breathing problems, drowsiness, convulsions, pains, or headaches which become worse.
See the separate article called Fever treatment for children: a doctor's advice.
How to manage a fever
The important things are to try to keep your child calm, reassured and comfortable.
Give plenty to drink. This helps to prevent a lack of fluid in the body (dehydration). You might find that a child is more willing to have a drink if they are not so irritable. So, if they are not keen to drink, it may help to give some paracetamol first.

Cooling an over-warm room may be helpful.
Cooling an over-warm room may be helpful.
Tepid sponging is not recommended for treatment of fever. This is because the blood vessels under the skin become narrower (constrict) if the water is too cold. This reduces heat loss and can trap heat in deeper parts of the body. The child may then get worse. Many children also find cold-sponging uncomfortable.

Seek medical advice if you suspect that your child is becoming dehydrated.
Febrile convulsions
Some children have a tendency to febrile convulsions. This is a type of seizure triggered by a rapid rise in body temperature. Some children have only one febrile convulsion, ever, but others go on to have them more often. See the separate leaflet called Febrile seizure (Febrile convulsion).
Febrile convulsions, and seizures due to infections such as meningitis, can look very similar. If a child has a seizure for the first time, it is important to rule out serious conditions such as meningitis before deciding it is a febrile convulsion.
Meningitis and septicaemia
Two of the most serious infections are meningitis and blood infection (septicaemia). These are uncommon; the vast majority of children with a fever do not have these infections.
The symptoms often develop quickly, over a few hours or so, or more slowly, over a few days. The symptoms may suggest a less serious illness at first, such as flu. But, even if you think it was flu to start with, if symptoms become worse and your child seems really unwell you should seek urgent medical advice.
Meningitis and septicaemia are always medical emergencies, so it is essential to know what signs to look out for. See the separate leaflets called Meningitis symptoms checklist and Child sepsis safety net for more details.

Food poisoning in children
Toddler's diarrhoea is a common cause of persistent (chronic) diarrhoea in young children. It mainly affects children between the ages of 1 and 5 years and is more common in boys. The child is well in themselves; they have no other symptoms. The diarrhoea will go as the child becomes older. The diet of young children is sometimes thought to contribute to the cause.
The diarrhoea will often stop if the child has a good amount of fat in the diet (whole milk, etc), does not drink too much fruit juice or squash and has meals that include a normal amount of fibre (but not a high-fibre diet).

What are the symptoms of toddler's diarrhoea?
Toddler's diarrhoea is also known as chronic nonspecific diarrhoea. Affected children have three or more watery loose stools (bowel motions) per day but they can have more than 10 episodes a day. The stools are often smellier and more pale than usual.
It is often possible to see pieces of undigested vegetable food in the stools (such as bits of carrot, sweetcorn, etc) which have come from a recent meal. Mild tummy (abdominal) pain sometimes occurs but is unusual. Some affected children develop constipation which alternates with diarrhoea.
A child with toddler's diarrhoea is otherwise well, grows normally and behaves normally. Examination does not find any abnormalities. Symptoms usually settle by the age of 5-6 years.
When to see a doctor about toddler's diarrhoea
If a child develops diarrhoea for the first time and it persists for more than a few days, or they seem unwell or have other symptoms, medical advice should be sought. Most children under 5 years of age with a typical history and normal examination will not need any further tests. Sometimes another condition, such as coeliac disease or an inflammatory bowel disease, might be suspected and these may require further tests (blood tests or stool test).
See the separate leaflet called Acute diarrhoea in children for more information about other causes of childhood diarrhoea.
What is the cause of toddler's diarrhoea?
The small bowel (small intestine) digests and absorbs food into the body and works normally in affected children.
The large bowel (colon) normally absorbs any excess water and forms solid stools. It is thought that the balance of fluid, fibre, undigested sugars and other undigested foods that reach the colon may be upset in affected children. This can increase the amount of fluid (water) that is kept in the colon instead of its being absorbed into the body. In young children, even a slight increase in fluid left in the colon can cause stools to become more frequent and runny than normal. As the child grows, the colon becomes more efficient and the condition goes.
Toddler's diarrhoea is not due to poor absorption (malabsorption) of food or to a serious bowel problem. It is also not due to any food intolerance.
What is the treatment for toddler's diarrhoea?
No treatment
No treatment is needed, particularly if symptoms are mild. Reassurance that it will ease in time may be all that is required. However, in many cases the diarrhoea will go, or become less severe, if the child changes certain eating and drinking habits.
Many toddlers develop eating and drinking habits that are not ideal and these may contribute to causing the diarrhoea. One or more of the following may be relevant. They are the '4 Fs': fat, fluid, fruit juices and fibre.
Fat
Toddler's diarrhoea is more common in children who eat a low-fat diet. Although a low-fat diet is often thought to be good for adults to help prevent heart disease, it is not good for young children. The diet of preschool children should have about 35-40% fat.
In general, this means drinking whole milk rather than semi-skimmed or skimmed.
A higher-fat food (such as whole milk yoghurt, milk pudding, ice cream or cheese) at the end of a meal may help to reduce toddler's diarrhoea.
Fruit juice
Children should not drink much fruit juice or squash. It is best to give water to children for most drinks and keep fruit juice as an occasional treat.
Too much juice or squash is not good for the following reasons:
Fruit juices contain various sugars (carbohydrates). Some types of sugar are not digested or absorbed and so get to the large bowel (colon). Here they may act to keep water in the bowel and cause watery stools. Clear apple juice seems to be the worst as it contains a lot of these sugars. Cloudy juices that contain some fibre are not as bad.

Here they may act to keep water in the bowel and cause watery stools. Clear apple juice seems to be the worst as it contains a lot of these sugars. Cloudy juices that contain some fibre are not as bad.
The sugar in juice and squash contains a lot of calories. This can reduce the appetite for normal meals. Therefore, the child tends to eat less fat and fibre at normal mealtimes.

Some children have become used to squash or juice on a regular basis and may become upset if they are suddenly denied their usual drink. In this case, juice should be very well diluted and then this dilution should be increased over time until the child can drink water happily.
Fluid
Some toddlers get into the habit of drinking almost constantly. This is often for comfort rather than because they are thirsty. Children do need plenty of fluids but more than 5-8 drinks a day can contribute to toddler's diarrhoea, even if they are drinking water. It may be worth considering limiting drinks to meal and snack times.
Fibre
Changing the fibre content of the diet may be helpful, as very low- or high-fibre intakes may make symptoms worse in some children. Fibre (roughage) is the part of plant food that is not digested. It stays in the gut and is passed in the stools. Fibre is present in many foods, particularly in fruit, wholemeal bread and vegetables.
Fibre acts a bit like blotting paper and absorbs water in the bowel. A child with a low-fibre diet may be helped by increasing the fibre in the diet to normal levels, by eating a healthy balanced diet that includes some fruit and vegetables.
However, a high-fibre diet may make things worse, as too much fibre can cause loose stools, especially in toddlers. It is important that children have a balanced diet but some foods are more likely to cause toddler's diarrhoea than others. Foods to consider reducing in toddler's diarrhoea include:
High-fibre cereals (eg, Weetabix®, porridge, muesli, cereals with raisins).

What are rigors?
A rigor is an episode of shivering and feeling very cold whilst your body temperature rises above normal. When the shivery part of the rigor ends, things change quite quickly. The affected person (who now has a fever) will suddenly feel too hot.
They will want to cool down, will look flushed and may sweat profusely. Gradually their body temperature will fall again. Rigors may occur only once in an illness, or can occur several times in a row.
Are rigors serious?
A rigor is not serious in itself, although it feels unpleasant. However, some of the causes of rigors are serious and some need immediate treatment. For this reason you should always seek medical advice if you or your child experience a rigor.
Causes of rigors
A germ (bacterium) called Streptococcus pneumoniae, which typically causes respiratory tract and ear infections, is the most common infectious bacterium to cause rigors in children. There are many other possible causes, although some are unusual (or not seen in the UK) and some occur only in adults.
Common infectious causes of rigors
This is not a complete list but it includes the most likely causes of rigors in children and adults, together with some of the more uncommon ones:

Symptoms of a rigor
A rigor is an episode of shivering and feeling very cold whilst your body temperature rises above normal, followed by an episode of feeling very warm whilst your body temperature falls again.
During the 'feeling cold and shivery' phase, other people will feel that you are hot to the touch although you'll feel as if you are too cold. During the 'feeling hot and sweaty' phase, you will feel as if you are too hot, and other people will notice you are flushed and sweaty.
Rigors last varying amounts of time, from minutes to hours. They may occur repeatedly.
Is there anything else rigors could be?
The shivering, pale face and sensation of cold in the shivery phase of rigors are similar to the shivering, pale face and sense of cold patients experience when their body temperature is actually too low (hypothermia).
You are unlikely to confuse the two, as a person with hypothermia will be cold to the touch, and their recent exposure to a cold environment is likely to be obvious. However the possibility of hypothermia should not be forgotten in someone who is shivering.
Hypothermia can come on gradually in elderly people in their own homes, particularly during spells of cold weather.
How common are rigors?
Rigors can happen in anyone who has an infection and experiences a sudden rise in temperature. Rigors are more common in children, who tend to develop higher temperatures than adults in response to infection. Older adults, particularly those who are very elderly, have less reactive immune systems, and are less likely to experience rigors.
How are rigors diagnosed?
Very often, listening to the history of exactly what happened, together with careful examination, will allow healthcare professionals to diagnose the location of infection which is the cause of rigors. If this is the case then treatment can begin without the need for further tests.
A typical example of this would be if the doctor finds that your child has the rash and throat infection of scarlet fever, or if they see the red, bulging, painful eardrum of otitis media.
However, if the cause of the infection is not obvious - and particularly if your child seems unwell - then your child is likely to be sent to your local hospital for further investigation of the source of the infection. This is important, as any tests your GP surgery can do will not generate immediate results, and treatment may be needed straightaway.
What tests might they do in hospital?
If you or your child are admitted to hospital, they will assume there is probably an infectious cause for the rigors. You may therefore be kept separate from other patients on the ward, to prevent transmission of infection. The tests that will be done depend partly on what they think is likely after examining you or your child.
All patients are likely to have blood tests. These look for signs of infection and help determine if it is a viral or a bacterial cause. Blood cultures look for bacteria circulating in the blood; these bacteria can be grown and tested to see which antibiotics will work against them. A blood sample may also be examined under a microscope to look for specific infections, such as malaria.

Urine testing is usual - urine will be 'dipped' to see if there are white blood cells or blood cells present, both of which suggest the possibility of infection of the bladder or kidneys - and then further tested to see what that infection might be.

Other tests which may be performed include:
Lumbar puncture (a sample of fluid from close to the spine, to look for meningitis).
Imaging using X-ray, computerised tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to look for local signs of infection internally.
Ultrasound to look for conditions such as appendicitis, gallstones or kidney stones, and abscess.

It is likely that you or your child will remain in hospital until diagnosis and treatment have been decided upon. Sometimes treatment will be started whilst you are awaiting firm diagnosis, on the basis that the doctors may have an idea of the most likely infection that you are experiencing.
Treatment for rigors
The most important thing is to work out what is causing the rigor and then to treat that cause. However, whilst the rigor is happening there are a few things you can do to make the person who is experiencing it more comfortable, calm and reassured.
Give lots to drink. This helps to prevent a lack of fluid in the body (dehydration). You might find that a child is more willing to have a drink if they are not so irritable. It may help to give some paracetamol and then try again with drinks half an hour or so later. If the child doesn't want to drink then syringing small amounts of fluid into their mouth very regularly (eg, every 5 - 10 minutes) can help.

Tepid sponging is not recommended because the blood vessels under the skin become narrower if the water is too cold and this may further raise the temperature. People with rigors also find sponging uncomfortable in the shivery phase.

See the separate leaflet called Fever in Children (High Temperature) for more information on managing fever.
Remember that paracetamol and ibuprofen do not treat the cause of the rigor. It is still important to seek medical advice to discover what caused the rigor, so that the correct treatment can be begun.
How is the cause of the rigor treated?
This is likely to require advice from a healthcare professional.
If the cause of the rigor is a viral infection then once a healthcare professional has identified this, it's possible that there will be no specific treatment, but you will be given information about what to expect from the condition. Some viral infections, such as measles, can be serious, and your child may need to stay in hospital if they are unwell.
Sometimes 'empirical' treatments are used. This means that the doctors are not yet certain of the cause of the rigors but they treat the patient with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. This is often given intravenously, as this is fastest and most effective in serious illness.
The antibiotic or antibiotics chosen will be those effective against the most likely cause of the rigors. In malarial zones (where malaria would be a highly likely cause of an unexplained temperature), malaria treatments may also be started before there is a firm diagnosis.
It is also likely that an intravenous drip will be set up. This allows you to be given extra fluid but also provides a useful route for giving intravenous antibiotics.
Why do we get rigors?
Our body temperature is controlled by a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. This acts as a thermostat and 'sets' the normal body temperature to around 37°C (98.6°F). The body then does all it can to obey the hypothalamus and hold its temperature at this setting. It generates heat through the processes of its metabolism. If it starts to get cold it takes steps to warm up; if it starts to get too hot it takes steps to cool down.
Rigors are triggered by the presence of chemicals called pyrogens in the blood which 'turn up' the body's thermostat setting, telling the body to aim for a higher target temperature. Pyrogens are produced by our own immune systems in response to certain triggers, of which infection is the most common.
The symptoms of a rigor are caused by the body responding to its internal thermostat having been turned up.
Why do we shiver with a rigor?
When the body's thermostat has been set higher than the body's actual temperature, the mechanisms that kick in are those that the body uses to warm itself up. These include:
Feeling a sensation of cold and so behaving in a way that increases temperature (wrapping up, curling up, seeking warmth).

Shivering.

Reducing heat loss from the skin by shrinking down (constricting) the tiny blood vessels in the skin, leading to a pale face and fingers that feel cold to the touch.
All of these tend to raise body temperature to match the new thermostat setting. Shivering raises our temperature because it is a muscular activity - running around would have a similar effect. Once the body reaches that new set temperature, shivering stops and you stop feeling cold.
As your body fights the infection, the immune system stops releasing pyrogens, and the hypothalamus drops the thermostat setting back towards normal. This tends to happen when the numbers of bacteria or viruses circulating in the blood fall. Your body then uses various mechanisms to lower your temperature again. These include:
Feeling hot and behaving in a way to lower temperature (fanning, taking off clothes).

If the process is repeated because a new rush of pyrogens is released into the blood, there will be another rigor. Some infections tend to cause repeated rigors, generally because there are repeated releases of infective agents.
Malaria typically causes repeated rigors with intervals of several days between them, as the malaria parasite is released into the blood in sudden rushes every few days. Parasites are living things (organisms) that live within, or on, another organism.
How is a rigor different from a febrile convulsion or a seizure?
It is important to know the difference between a rigor, a febrile convulsion and a seizure (sometimes called a fit).
During a rigor the affected person will be shivery (and may be shaking violently). They may be confused (particularly when their temperature is high) but during a rigor they will be conscious, and will be able to respond to you - for example, by obeying commands like: "Open your eyes."
Febrile convulsions are a type of seizure that can happen when a child, between the ages of 6 months and 6 years, has a high temperature (fever). During a febrile convulsion your child will not be conscious and will not respond to you. A febrile convulsion lasts anything from seconds to about five minutes. See the separate leaflet called Febrile Seizure (Febrile Convulsion) for more information.
A seizure is like a febrile convulsion but it may occur at any age. During a seizure the patient will not be conscious and will not respond to you. A seizure in a person who is unwell is suggestive of illness affecting the brain (such as stroke or meningitis). Seizures may also arise in people who have an increased tendency to seizures - a condition called epilepsy. See the separate leaflet called Epilepsy and Seizures for more information.
What is a rigor seizure or rigor fit?
The term 'rigor seizure' or 'rigor fit' is widely discussed on the internet, with people asking what it is on several websites. Rigors and seizures are separate things. Some people refer to the violent shivering of a rigor as a 'rigor seizure' or 'rigor fit' - but these are confusing terms which are better avoided as they make it unclear what has happened (ie was it a rigor, or a seizure, or both?).
Whilst it is possible (although quite unusual) to have a rigor and a seizure at the same time (as the same underlying illness could cause both to occur simultaneously), they are two very different things.
A rigor may involve violent and uncontrollable shivering, sometimes with mild confusion, but the patient remains conscious and can respond to you. A seizure may also involve jerky shiver-like movements, but patients are not aware of their surroundings and do not respond to you.
Will I experience rigors again?
You may experience a rigor again the next time you have an infection that causes a high temperature. The chance of reacting in this way to infection decreases slowly as you become older.

Pityriasis rosea
Molluscum contagiosum is a common condition where small warty bumps (mollusca) appear on the skin. It is caused by a virus that can be passed on by skin contact or from contaminated towels, flannels, soft toys, etc. It is not serious and usually clears within 12-18 months without any treatment.

How to prevent molluscum contagiosum
Molluscum contagiosum causes
Molluscum contagiosum is a type of skin infection caused by a virus, which can be passed on by skin-to-skin contact. People can also be infected by touching things that have been contaminated by the virus. For example, by sharing towels, flannels or soft toys that have been used by someone who has molluscum contagiosum.
Once one area of skin is affected, the rash can spread to other areas of the skin. However, most people are resistant (immune) to this virus. Therefore, most people who come into contact with affected people do not develop molluscum contagiosum.
Molluscum contagiosum in adults
In adults, sometimes the virus is passed on during close skin-to-skin contact when having sex. If it is passed on through sexual contact then the first mollusca to appear tend to be on the skin of the lower tummy (abdomen) and in the genital area: around the penis, vagina or back passage (anus).
If this happens, it's a good idea to get checked for other sexually transmitted infections. You can attend a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic for tests and do not need a referral from your GP.
People whose immune systems are not working as well as usual are more likely to get molluscum contagiosum. (For example, people with AIDS, or people who are having chemotherapy or steroid treatment.)
In people with a weakened immune system, areas of molluscum contagiosum might be larger or spread widely over the body.
Who gets molluscum contagiosum?
Molluscum contagiosum in kids
Molluscum contagiosum can affect anyone of any age. It is most common in children and mostly happens in children aged 1-4 years. However, it can also (much less commonly) affect adults.
Molluscum contagiosum symptoms
Molluscum contagiosum causes small lumps (mollusca) on the skin, which are pearly-white or slightly pink.

Sometimes many mollusca develop over various parts of the skin. They tend to occur in groups or clusters. Any part of the body can be affected but it is rare on the palms and soles.
Molluscum contagiosum stages
The small lumps (mollusca) on the skin usually develop 2-8 weeks after becoming infected with the virus. Typically, each lump (molluscum) lasts a few weeks or months, crusts over and then goes.
However, new ones tend to appear as old ones are going, as the virus spreads to other areas of skin. Therefore, crops of mollusca may appear to come and go for several months.
For some people, the main concern is that the mollusca can look unsightly. Most children are not bothered by it.
How long does molluscum contagiosum last?
It commonly takes 12-18 months before the last of the mollusca goes completely. Occasionally, the condition lasts longer than two years - sometimes as long as five years.
Molluscum contagiosum treatment
No treatment
It's usually best not to treat molluscum at all, particularly in children.
This is because:
The small lumps (mollusca) on the skin will usually go away without treatment within 12-18 months. Children with molluscum contagiosum can still go to school, do sports, swim, and all of their usual activities.

Is molluscum contagiosum serious?
Molluscum contagiosum is usually harmless.
The small lumps (mollusca) on the skin are not usually itchy, painful, or serious. A scar is not usually left when they go but sometimes a tiny dent or mark remains. In a few people the skin looks lighter in the places where mollusca have been.
In people with eczema (atopic dermatitis), molluscum can trigger an eczema flare. Molluscum can also cause an eczema-like reaction (
Occasionally, the skin next to a lump (molluscum) becomes infected with germs (bacteria). This can be treated with antibiotic creams or medicines. Rarely, a molluscum on an eyelid causes eye inflammation. (See a doctor if any eye symptoms develop related to a molluscum.)
After an episode of molluscum contagiosum has cleared away, people are normally then immune to the virus, meaning it's very unlikely to come back.
If you develop a very large number of mollusca (hundreds) or the mollusca are larger than normal, it could be a marker of an underlying problem with your immune system, which might require further tests.
How to prevent molluscum contagiosum
The chance of passing on the molluscum contagiosum virus to others is small, and it is not serious anyway. Therefore, there is no need to keep children with molluscum contagiosum off school, or away from swimming pools, etc. There is no need for adults to keep away from gyms or other people.
To reduce the chance of spreading the virus to others:
Don't share towels, clothes, soft toys, or bathwater if you have molluscum contagiosum.

Try not to scratch the mollusca, as this may increase the risk of spreading the rash to other areas of the skin. Molluscum contagiosum can be passed on to other people (is contagious) until the last lump (molluscum) has gone.
