hi I’m just looking for some advice or help on heart palpitations I’ve been suffering with them on and off for 5 year but recently they have been everyday started off as a few a day but now they are non stop every couple of minutes and they are really starting to scare me I hate the pause then the big thud after. I’ve had 24hr ecg and echocardiogram and they didn’t pick anything up I’m currently waiting for a 7 day monitor but don’t know how long that will be. is there anything else in the mean time I can be doing to try and help them any help would be appreciated.
