My father was diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease last year. it is very severe, he has already had one leg amputated above the knee and it looks as though his other leg is now affected. Hes already been told there are signs of calcification around his heart too. Having looked at medical research it looks as though the outlook is quite dim, with many dying of this disease within 5 years.
I just want some honesty, if he does have to have the other leg amputated, what are his chances? will this disease spread to other areas of the body? I want to be informed and prepared.
thanks in advance
