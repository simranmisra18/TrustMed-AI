Let me start by saying i know i suffer from anxiety episodes and have them too often. Never have been medicated for it i generally like to live a natural lifestyle and am generally healthy aside from the anxiety. Most commonly it's my husband who sends me into these and when I am exhilarated enough I get the full blown adrenaline pumping into my throat, heart racing, hot flashes, and a some sudden jabs of pain in my chest. it's all very sudden and passes as I calm down. we had an argument last night and I was yelling at him and I could feel my blood boiling but instead of the normal reaction I just explained I have this terrible gripping squeezing pain under my left breast into my armpit and shoulder. I have tried deep breathing, resting, massaging. everytime I breathe it's pain. when I straighten out my back it's pain. lifting my arm, laying down, trying to turn over in my sleep...extremely painful. I can bring tiny comforts by putting immense pressure around my breast and pressing down but it only dulls some of the sharper pains I get when I move and breath. some may say it's silly just go to the doctor but I don't have insurance. I don't want them sending me home stating anxiety when I know it's more. this won't go away and it happened right during an emotionally stressful row. please just a little incite. It's been about 12 hours now.
