i have been having these episodes for over 2 years every so often my heart rate will suddenly shoot up to between 140-200, I also start sweating become really dizzy(sometimes pass out) and have a bout of diarrhea and nausea (which will pass quickly) and chest pain they usually last about an hour but then I feel crappy for a few days after I've had various tests done and my 24hour heart monitor showed I had an arrhythmia and occasionally skips a beat which I don't understand nothing has actually been explained to me. I've been on the waiting list to see cardiology for a year and still waiting, the doctors gave me amlodipine (bring the heart rate down) but it started another episode so I'm not allowed to take anything until I've seen cardiology. The doctors don't really have a clue does anyone else experience this or can shed some light?
