When my doctor put me on bethanechol for weak bladder muscles it worked great and I was thrilled. Four months ago I had a heart attack requiring a stent. These 2 events happened at around the same time. Lately I have been experiencing chest pains that I have identified, from researching the internet, as Angina Pectoris. While in bed last night the thought came to me that if bethanechol is a muscle constrictor, perhaps it's constrictive of arteries as well, causing angina. This line of reasoning led me here. I'd really appreciate hearing from anyone who could share any info on this subject. I'm going to ease off bethanechol to see if this has a positive effect on the angina. Thank you, Tom

Hi Tom,
I am not an expert, but I have read up on bethanechol.  It is not a general purpose muscle constrictor.   I would be led by the information leaflet - which gives side effects.  The only one which pertains is "tightness of chest" (rare). That could make you think you have angina pain, but that is not the same as having it.

I just just read some more on the internet, and it says that people with heart disease should NOT take bethanechol.   Also that "tighness in the chest" although rare,  is serious.   I suppose it depends how bad it is. I reckon you should confirm what I have found and take it up with your doctor.

Thank you oldboy.
I have since read the same info re heart patients NOT being candidates for bethanechol.  I stopped taking it today and I must say there is some relief for the Angina.  The problem is, as I see it, is/was that the urologist and my cardiologist are each working on 2 different problems and thedy were NOT coordinating with each other.  It is going to be up to me to open lines of communications.  I did mention to the cardiologist that I was on bethanechol and he didn't react at all.  In retrospect this tells me he's not familiar with it.
I have an appointment with cariologist on Aug 31.
Tom

The only suggestion I have is to checkout with your Doctor or chemist for side effects of your Bethanecol. See a doctor/specialist to be assessed for your chest pains or when you have chest pains that you cant control go to your nearest hospital to be assessed that is what I would do myself. Then you would know what is happening and you would have less worry knowing what you have and how it can be treated. Good luck.

I too started with Bethanecol around 3 months ago. I felt that it worked great and my PVR came down. But I have started experiencing some chest pain too. It happens every now and then. I dont have any heart issues that I know of i.e BP & Cholestrol is normal. But I will surely get this checked out. If there is any more data on this subject, please do share since this thread is almost 5 years old.
