Hello, My mom takes blood pressure medications. She has a pacemaker. She experiences sharp blood fluctuations in blood pressure every one or two hours. Yesterday she had the following: 12:01PM - 111/66/72 13:32PM - 128/76/57 14:24PM - 145/76/67 16:16PM - 103/61/51 This morning she had the following: 6:35AM - 114/67/65 7:03AM - 106/67/62 7:51AM - 127/75/69 Every time fluctuations occur, she hears noise in her ears and experiences headache, usually on the back of her head.

For myself, I would not consider those a spike, Yours blood pressure fluctuates all the time throughout the day. Even just standing up will change your blood pressure. Any activity will change it.
