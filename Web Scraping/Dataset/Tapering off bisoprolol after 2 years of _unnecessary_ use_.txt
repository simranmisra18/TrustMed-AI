Two years ago, I was prescribed 2.5mg of bisoprolol after an anxiety-related tachycardia episode. The cardiologist also diagnosed a mild mitral valve prolapse, which might cause some minor arrhythmias during stress. He recommended taking the beta-blocker for 6 months along with regular cardio, and then tapering off. However, I didn’t return to the doctor as planned and ended up staying on bisoprolol for almost 2 years. I’m still taking it today. My main concern is: could I have harmed my body by staying on bisoprolol for so long? And can I still taper off safely now, even after this extended use? Does the body become “dependent” on bisoprolol after long-term use?
Sorry if this is not an appropriate question here.

I cannot help with this but I copied your post and pasted it on ChatGPT. It gives a comprehensive answer. Try it yourself as I don’t think it appropriate for me to copy it here. Good luck.
