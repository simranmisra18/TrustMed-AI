What is insomnia?
Insomnia means poor sleep. About one third of adults do not get as much sleep as they would like. Poor sleep can mean:
Not being able to get off to sleep.

Some people find it harder to sleep as they get older. We explore the science behind why ageing affects your slumber and how you can improve your chances of getting a good night's rest.

Mental health
Snoring is a noise made as we breathe during our sleep. It may not cause any problems to the person who snores, but it may be so noisy that it disturbs other people sleeping. Sometimes it also interrupts the sleep of the person who snores, making them tired in the daytime. Many lifestyle factors make snoring more likely, and can be changed. If snoring becomes a problem, there are some treatments which can help. You should consult a doctor about snoring if it is affecting your sleep, making you tired in the daytime, or upsetting other people.
by Dr Rosalyn Adleman, MRCGP
What is a normal amount of sleep?
Different people need different amounts of sleep. Children need more sleep than adults. For adults, the minimum we need is about 6 hours per night. On average, most adults need between 6 and 9 hours of sleep to feel refreshed.
Most people establish a pattern that is normal for them in their early adult life. However, as you become older, it is normal to sleep less. For most people it takes less than thirty minutes to fall asleep.
So, everyone is different. What is important is that the amount of sleep that you get should be sufficient for you, and that you usually feel refreshed and not sleepy during the daytime. Therefore, the strict medical definition of insomnia is: 'Difficulty in getting to sleep, difficulty staying asleep, early wakening, or non-restorative sleep despite adequate time and opportunity to sleep, resulting in impaired daytime functioning, such as poor concentration, mood disturbance, and daytime tiredness.'
Further ways to promote sleep in more difficult cases include relaxation techniques, regular exercise and certain psychological therapies.
Sleeping tablets are not the best way to help with sleep problems because they don't fix the cause of insomnia, you can get addicted to them, and they often stop working if you take them regularly.
Understanding normal sleep
A normal night's sleep has three main parts:
Quiet sleep. This is divided into stages 1-4. Each stage becomes more deep. Quiet sleep is sometimes called deep sleep.
Quiet sleep. This is divided into stages 1-4. Each stage becomes more deep. Quiet sleep is sometimes called deep sleep.
Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep occurs when the brain is very active but the body is limp, apart from the eyes which move rapidly. Most dreaming occurs during REM sleep.

Short periods of waking for 1-2 minutes.
Short periods of waking for 1-2 minutes.
Each night, about 4-5 periods of quiet sleep alternate with 4-5 periods of REM sleep. In addition, several short periods of waking for 1-2 minutes occur about every two hours or so, but occur more frequently towards the end of the night's sleep. The graph below shows a typical normal pattern of sleep in a young adult.
Hypnogram
Normally, you do not remember the times that you wake if they last less than two minutes. If you are distracted during the wakeful times (for example, a partner snoring, traffic noise, etc) then the wakeful times tend to last longer and you are more likely to remember them.
What causes insomnia?
Poor sleep may develop for no apparent reason. However, there are a number of possible causes which include the following:
Concern about wakefulness
You may remember the normal times of being awake in the night. You may feel that to wake in the night is not normal, and worry about getting back off to sleep. You may clock-watch and check the time each time you wake up.
This may make you irritated or anxious, and you are more likely to remember the times of wakefulness. You may then have an impression of having a bad night's sleep, even when the total amount of time asleep was normal.
Temporary problems
Poor sleep is often temporary. This may be because of stress, a work or family problem, jet lag, a change of routine, a new baby, a strange bed, etc. Poor sleep in these situations usually improves in time.
Stress, anxiety or depression
You may find it difficult to switch off your anxieties about work, home or personal problems. Also, poor sleep is sometimes due to depression. Other symptoms of depression include a low mood, lethargy, poor concentration, tearfulness and persistent negative thoughts. Depression is common. Treatment of depression or anxiety often cures the poor sleep too.
Sleep apnoea
This sometimes occurs in people who snore, most commonly in obese people. In this condition the large airways narrow or collapse as you fall asleep. This not only causes snoring but also reduces the amount of oxygen that gets to the lungs.
This causes you to wake up to breathe properly. You may wake up many times each night which may result in daytime tiredness. See the separate leaflet called Sleep apnoea. Note: most people who snore do not have sleep apnoea and they do sleep well.
Other illnesses
Various illnesses keep some people awake. For example, illness causing pain, leg cramps, breathlessness, indigestion, cough, itch, hot flushes, mental health problems, etc.
Stimulants
These can interfere with sleep. There are three common culprits.
Alcohol - many people take an alcoholic drink to help sleep. Alcohol does help you get to sleep quicker, but then causes broken, poor-quality sleep and early morning wakefulness.

Caffeine - which is in tea, coffee, some soft drinks such as cola, and even chocolate. It is also in some painkiller tablets and other medicines (check the ingredients on the medicine packet). Caffeine is a stimulant and may cause poor sleep.

Other recreational drugs
Other recreational drugs (for example, ecstasy, cocaine, cannabis and amphetamines) can affect sleep.
Prescribed medicines
Some medicines sometimes interfere with sleep. For example, 'water tablets' (diuretics), some antidepressants, steroids, beta-blockers, painkillers containing caffeine, and some cold remedies containing pseudoephedrine. Also, if you suddenly stop taking regular sleeping tablets or other sedative medicines, this can cause rebound poor sleep.
Screen time
There is some evidence that the time we spend looking at electronic screens can affect our sleep. It may be that certain types of light from e-readers and electronic tablets can disrupt control of our natural day-and-night cycle.
There are studies which suggest we may sleep better after reading a printed book or a particular kind of screen before bedtime. There are also some studies which show that in children and adolescents, more time using electronic devices in the daytime is linked to less good sleep at night. It's best to avoid using screens within an hour or two of bed. Try to keep devices like phones and laptops out of reach of the bed, or, ideally, outside the bedroom entirely.
Unrealistic expectations
Some people just need less sleep than others. If your sleep pattern has not changed, and you do not feel sleepy during the day, you are probably getting enough sleep. Older people and people who do little exercise tend to need less sleep. Some people think they should be able to nap during the day - and sleep eight hours at night!
A vicious cycle
Whatever the initial cause, worry about poor sleep and worry about feeling tired the next day are common reasons for the problem to become worse.
Sleep paralysis
Some people may also experience waking from sleep but then being unable to move or speak for a period of time. Some people experience the same problems when they are falling asleep. See the separate leaflet called Sleep paralysis.
Insomnia classifications
There are different definitions and classifications of poor sleep (insomnia) around, which can make things confusing. Doctors may classify insomnia into one of the following categories:
By type
Primary insomnia is insomnia that occurs when no illness or other secondary cause (comorbidity) is identified. Primary insomnia accounts for about one in five cases of long-term insomnia.
Primary insomnia is insomnia that occurs when no illness or other secondary cause (comorbidity) is identified. Primary insomnia accounts for about one in five cases of long-term insomnia.
Secondary (or comorbid) insomnia occurs when insomnia is a symptom of, or is associated with, other conditions. These can be medical or mental health conditions, or drug or substance misuse (as discussed above).
Secondary (or comorbid) insomnia occurs when insomnia is a symptom of, or is associated with, other conditions. These can be medical or mental health conditions, or drug or substance misuse (as discussed above).
By duration
Short-term if insomnia lasts days to weeks, and up to three months.
Short-term if insomnia lasts days to weeks, and up to three months.
Long-term (or persistent) if insomnia lasts for three months or longer.
Long-term (or persistent) if insomnia lasts for three months or longer.
By a combination of factors
Some authorities use the term 'chronic insomnia disorder'. To have this diagnosis, you would:
Have problems sleeping for at least three nights a week for at least three months.
Have problems sleeping for at least three nights a week for at least three months.
Be distressed or have problems functioning due to your sleeping problem.

Understanding some facts
It is often helpful to understand that short periods of waking each night are normal. Some people are reassured about this and so do not become anxious when they find themselves awake in the night.
Also, remember that worry about poor sleep can itself make things worse. Also, it is common to have a few bad nights if you have a period of stress, anxiety or worry. This is often just for a short time and a normal sleep pattern often resumes after a few days.
General tips for sleeping better (often called sleep hygiene)
The following are commonly advised to help promote sleep in people with sleep difficulties, and may be all that is necessary:
Reduce caffeine - do not have any food, medicines, or drinks that contain caffeine or other stimulants for six hours before bedtime (see above). Some people have found that cutting out caffeine completely through the day has helped.

Body rhythms - try to get into a routine of wakefulness during the day and sleepiness at night. The body becomes used to rhythms or routines. If you keep to a pattern, you are more likely to sleep well. Therefore:
No matter how tired you are, do not sleep or nap during the day.
It is best to go to bed only when sleepy-tired in the late evening.
Switch the light out as soon as you get into bed.
Always get up at the same time each day, seven days a week, however short the time asleep. Use an alarm to help with this. Resist the temptation to lie in - even after a poor night's sleep. Do not use weekends to catch up on sleep, as this may upset the natural body rhythm that you have got used to in the week.

The bedroom should be a quiet, relaxing place to sleep:
It should not be too hot, cold, or noisy.
Earplugs and eye shades may be useful if you are sleeping with a snoring or wakeful partner.
Make sure the bedroom is dark with good curtains to stop early morning sunlight.
Don't use the bedroom for activities such as work, eating or television.
Consider changing your bed if it is old, or not comfortable.
Hide your alarm clock under your bed. Many people will clock-watch and this does not help you to get off to sleep.

Mood and atmosphere - try to relax and wind down with a routine before going to bed. For example:
A stroll followed by a bath, some reading, and a warm drink (without caffeine) may be relaxing in the late evening.
Do not do anything mentally demanding within 90 minutes of going to bed - such as studying.
Go to bed when sleepy-tired.
Some people find playing soft music is helpful at bedtime. Try a player with a time switch that turns the music off after about 30 minutes.

Relaxation techniques
These aim to reduce your mental and physical arousal before going to bed. Relaxation techniques may help even if you are not anxious but find it hard to get off to sleep. There are a number of techniques.
For example, progressive muscular relaxation has been shown to help promote sleep. This technique consists of tensing and relaxing various muscle groups in sequence. For more information, see the leaflet called Relaxation exercises.
You can find a podcast or app that takes you through deep-breathing exercises, and other methods to help you relax. See Further Reading below.
Daytime exercise
Regular daytime exercise can help you to feel more relaxed and tired at bedtime. This may help you to sleep better. (However, you should not do exercise near to bedtime if you have insomnia.) If possible, do some exercise on most days.
Even a walk in the afternoon or early evening is better than nothing. However, ideally, you should aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise on five or more days a week.
Moderate exercise means that you get warm and slightly out of breath. You do not need to go to a gym! Brisk walking, jogging, cycling, climbing stairs, heavy DIY, heavy gardening, dancing and heavy housework are all moderate-intensity physical exercises. See the separate leaflet called Exercise and physical activity.
Behavioural and cognitive therapies
If you have severe persistent poor sleep, your doctor may refer you to a psychologist or other health professional for psychological treatments. These are various therapies which help re-train your brain and the way you feel, think or behave.
Research studies have found that there is a good chance that behavioural and cognitive therapies will improve sleep in adults with insomnia. Increasingly, research has also shown that some of these therapies can be delivered digitally (ie through an app, online, etc).
There are various types of therapy and they include the following:
Stimulus-control therapy. This helps you to re-associate the bed and bedroom with sleep and to re-establish a consistent sleep/wake pattern.
Sleep restriction therapy. Very briefly, the principle of this treatment is that you limit the time that you spend in bed at night. As things improve, the time in bed is then lengthened. An example of the way that this may be done in practice is as follows:
First, you may be asked to find out how much you are actually sleeping each night. You can do this by keeping a sleep diary.
First, you may be asked to find out how much you are actually sleeping each night. You can do this by keeping a sleep diary.
You may then be advised to restrict the amount of time that you spend in bed to the time that you actually sleep each night. For example, if you spend eight hours in bed each night but you sleep for only six hours then your allowed time in bed would be six hours. So, in this example, say you normally go to bed at 11 pm, get to sleep at 1 am and get up at 7 am. To restrict your time in bed to six hours, you may be advised to go to bed at 1 am but still get up at 7 am.

Relaxation training. This teaches you ways of reducing tension. For example, this may include the progressive muscle relaxation technique as described earlier, plus various other techniques described earlier.
Paradoxical intention. This involves staying passively awake, avoiding any intention to fall asleep. It is used for people who have trouble getting to sleep (but not maintaining sleep).
Biofeedback. With this technique, you are connected to electrical sensors which give you feedback by sounds and lights to show you what your body is doing. This is to help you control certain body functions (such as muscle tension).
Cognitive therapy. Cognitive therapy is often used in combination with a behavioural intervention (such as stimulus control, sleep restriction, or relaxation training); this is then called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
See the separate article CBT for insomnia: how does it work? for more details.
Accessing sleep-focused therapy
There are various different ways to access sleep-focused therapy. What's available on the NHS varies a little depending on where you are.
Your GP may be able to refer you for sessions led by a psychotherapist or psychologist. These can be individual or group sessions, and may be in-person, over the phone, or via video call.
There are also online courses and apps. Sleepio is one example of an app that uses cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Sleepio was recommended for use by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2022. In some areas of the UK it's available free on the NHS; in other places you may need to pay a subscription.

What about sleeping tablets?
Sleeping tablets are not usually advised for insomnia
The main types of sleeping tablets are in a class of medicines called benzodiazepines and a class called Z drugs. To read more about why these medicines may be prescribed, see the separate leaflet called Benzodiazepines and Z drugs.
In the past, sleeping tablets were commonly prescribed. However, they have been shown to have problems and are now not commonly prescribed.
If a sleeping tablet is prescribed, it is usually just a short course (a week or so) to get over a particularly bad patch.
Possible problems with sleeping tablets include:
Drowsiness the next day. You may not be safe to drive or to operate machinery.
Drowsiness the next day. You may not be safe to drive or to operate machinery.
Clumsiness and confusion in the night if you have to get up. For example, if you have had a sleeping tablet, you may fall over if you get up in the night to go to the toilet. (Older people who take sleeping tablets have an increased risk of falling and breaking their hip.)

Tolerance to sleeping tablets may develop if you take them regularly. This means that, in time, the usual dose has no effect. You then need a higher dose to help with sleep. In time, the higher dose then has no effect, and so on.

Some people become addicted to (dependent on) sleeping tablets and have withdrawal symptoms if the tablets are stopped suddenly.

Other medicines that may be used to help sleep include melatonin and some antihistamines.
Herbal remedies are used by some people to help with sleep. For example, valerian.
However, research studies have shown that there is very little evidence to show that these work. Therefore, they are not recommended.
Long-term use of sleeping tablets has been linked with serious health problems, such as an increased risk of dementia, and an increased risk of earlier death.
If you've been taking sleeping tablets for a long time, your doctor should regularly review them with you, including discussing the benefits and harms. If you want to stop, they are no longer helping, or they are becoming harmful, your doctor may suggest stopping them - usually in a gradual way and with support.
A final note
See a doctor if you feel that illness or medication is causing poor sleep. Treating any underlying condition that is causing the problem, if possible, can help to promote sleep. In particular, depression and anxiety are common causes of poor sleep and can often be treated.

What is anxiety?
Anxiety is a natural response to feeling afraid or threatened. Anxiety can become a problem if we start worrying excessively about relatively harmless situations. When our anxiety feels intense or overwhelming, it starts to interfere with our daily life.
What is anxiety?
When you are anxious you feel fearful and tense. In addition you may also have one or more unpleasant mental or physical symptoms.
Anxiety symptoms
Physical symptoms of anxiety include:
The sensation of having a 'thumping heart' (palpitations).

The physical symptoms are partly caused by the brain which sends lots of messages down nerves to various parts of the body when you are anxious. When you are anxious you release stress hormones, such as adrenaline (epinephrine), into the bloodstream. These act on the heart, muscles and other parts of the body to cause symptoms, such as a thumping heartbeat and sweaty palms.

Mental health
Almost unbelievable, isn't it? That we're alive. When you think about how many tiny different things that can go wrong with the human body, it's a wonder we're here at all. Especially when we're constantly exposed to messages in the media that we're just one step away from a life-threatening illness. So it's no surprise that many people are in constant fear for their health. This is hypochondria: when you fear you are ill despite a doctor telling you otherwise.

What causes anxiety?
Some people may be more prone to anxiety because of their genetics and there may be a chemical imbalance in the brain which makes them feel much more anxious.

Is anxiety normal?
Feelings of anxiety are normal in stressful situations and can even be helpful. For example, most people will be anxious when threatened by an aggressive person, or before an important race. The burst of adrenaline (epinephrine) and nerve impulses which we have in response to stressful situations can encourage a 'fight or flight' response.
Anxiety is abnormal and can be classed as a mental health condition if it:
Is out of proportion to the stressful situation; or

What are anxiety disorders?
You may have an anxiety disorder if anxiety symptoms interfere with your normal day-to-day activities, or if worry about developing anxiety symptoms affects your life. It is thought that about 1 in 20 people have an anxiety disorder at any one time.
There are various conditions (disorders) where anxiety is a main symptom. Some people have features of more than one type of disorder at the same time.
See the links below for more information on some of the main types of anxiety disorders:
Social anxiety disorder.

Adjustment reaction is similar to an acute stress reaction but symptoms develop days or weeks after a stressful situation such as a divorce or house move. It is called an 'adjustment reaction' because it is caused by a reaction or adjustment to the problem. Symptoms are similar to acute reaction to stress but may include depression. The symptoms tend to improve over a few weeks or so.
Anxiety treatment
The main aim of anxiety treatment is to help you to reduce symptoms so that anxiety no longer affects your day-to-day life.
The treatment options depend on what condition you have and how severely you are affected. They may include one or more of the following:
NON-MEDICATION TREATMENTS
Understanding
Understanding the cause of symptoms and talking things over with a friend, family member or health professional may help. In particular, some people worry that the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as a 'thumping heart' are due to a physical illness - 'a heart problem'. This can make anxiety worse. Understanding that you have an anxiety disorder is unlikely to cure your symptoms but it often helps.
Counselling
This may help some people with certain conditions. For example, counselling which focuses on problem-solving skills may help if you have generalised anxiety disorder (GAD).
Anxiety management courses
These may be an option for some conditions, if courses are available in your area. The courses may include: learning how to relax, problem-solving skills, coping strategies and group support.
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for anxiety
This therapy, if available in your area, can work well for persisting anxiety disorders and phobias:
CBT is a type of therapy that deals with your current thought processes and/or behaviours and aims to change them, which may help you to manage your anxiety. See the separate leaflet called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT).
Self-help
There are various national groups which can help by giving information, advice and support. They, or your doctor or practice nurse, may also be able to put you in touch with a local support group for face-to-face support.
You can also get leaflets, books, CDs, DVDs, MP3s, etc, on relaxation and combating stress. They teach simple deep-breathing techniques and other measures to relieve stress, help you to relax and possibly ease anxiety symptoms.
MEDICATION
Antidepressant medicines
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the group of antidepressants commonly used as anti-anxiety medications.
SSRIs often used for anxiety are:
Escitalopram.
Escitalopram.
Sertraline.
Sertraline.
These are commonly used to treat depression but also help to reduce the symptoms of anxiety even if you are not depressed. They work by interfering with brain chemicals (also called neurotransmitters) such as serotonin which may be involved in causing anxiety symptoms. Antidepressants are not tranquillisers and are not usually addictive.
Other similar medications that can be used by your doctor to help manage anxiety are:
Mirtazapine.
Mirtazapine.
Venlafaxine.
Venlafaxine.
Paroxetine. - this is now rarely prescribed by GPs.
Paroxetine. - this is now rarely prescribed by GPs.
Benzodiazepines
Benzodiazepines such as diazepam used to be the most commonly prescribed anxiety treatment. They were known as the minor tranquilisers but they do have some serious known side-effects. They often work well to ease symptoms in the short term.
The problem is they are addictive and can lose their effect if you take them for more than a few weeks. They may also make you drowsy. They are not used often for persistent anxiety conditions now.
A short course of up to two weeks may be an option for anxiety which is very severe and short-term, or now and then to help you over a bad spell if you have persistent anxiety symptoms.
Buspirone
Buspirone is sometimes prescribed to treat GAD. It is an anti-anxiety medicine but different to the benzodiazepines and is not thought to be addictive. It is not clear how it works. It is thought to affect serotonin, a brain chemical which may be involved in causing anxiety symptoms.
Beta-blocker medicines
A beta-blocker - for example, propranolol - can ease some of the physical symptoms such as trembling and a 'thumping heart' (palpitations). Beta-blocker medicines do not directly affect the mental symptoms such as worry.
However, some people relax more easily if their physical symptoms are eased. These tend to work best in short-lived (acute) anxiety. For example, if you become more anxious before a test (eg, a driving test or an exam) then a beta-blocker may help to ease 'the shakes'.
In some cases a combination of anxiety treatments such as cognitive therapy and an antidepressant may work better than either treatment alone.
Alcohol and anxiety
Although alcohol may ease symptoms in the short term, don't think that drinking helps to cure social anxiety. It does not.
Drinking alcohol to 'calm nerves' can lead to problem drinking and may make problems with social anxiety and depression worse in the long term. See a doctor if you are drinking alcohol (or taking street drugs) to ease anxiety.
When to see a doctor for anxiety
You should see a doctor if you're struggling to cope with anxiety, fear or panic, or if things you're trying yourself are not helping.
You can also get free talking therapies like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on the NHS. You can refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP (see 'Further Reading' below for the link.

Dealing with depression
Depression is a common mood disorder in which you have a persistent low mood. Symptoms can affect day-to-day life and can become very distressing. Treatments include talking (psychological) treatments and antidepressant medicines. Treatment takes time to work but has a good chance of success. Some people have repeated episodes of depression and require long-term treatment to keep symptoms away.

What is depression?
What is depression?
Depression (also known as clinical depression, major depression or major depressive disorder) is a mental health condition. The main symptom is low mood (sadness), but it can also cause many other symptoms, such as a loss of enjoyment in things, problems thinking, and difficulties with sleep or eating. To diagnose depression, symptoms have to have been present for at least two weeks.
Depression usually interferes with normal day-to-day activities in some way, such as affecting work, studying, or your social life.
Many people with depression also experience anxiety.
How common is depression?
Depression is common. It is one of the most common illnesses that GPs deal with. About 5 in 100 adults experience depression every year. Across their lifetime, about 15 out of every 100 people will experience depression, although other estimates are even higher, up to 1 in 3 people.
Depression is about twice as common in women than in men, although it's possible that depression is more likely to go unrecognised in men.
Mental health
The days are getting colder and shorter, which means autumn has arrived in the UK. Soon, the clocks will jump back by an hour to mark the end of Daylight Savings Time or British Summer Time. Although this will give us an extra hour in bed, the clocks changing could have an impact on our health.

Depression symptoms
Depression can affect people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. Signs and symptoms of depression include:
Core symptoms
Persistent sadness or low mood. Some people feel tearful.

Recurrent thoughts of death. This is not usually a fear of death, more a preoccupation with death and dying. For some people despairing thoughts such as "life's not worth living" or "I don't care if I don't wake up" are common. Sometimes these thoughts progress into thoughts about, and even plans for, suicide.

Some people consult a doctor at first because they have a physical symptom such as chest pains. They are concerned that they may have a physical problem such as a heart condition when it is actually due to depression.
Anxiety symptoms
Anxiety is usually considered a different condition to depression, but it's very common for people to have symptoms of both at the same time. Usually, symptoms of one or the other predominate (ie mostly anxiety, or mostly depression), but some people have equal symptoms of both (mixed anxiety and depression). Symptoms of anxiety include:
Feeling worried, tense, or afraid.

Symptoms of psychotic depression
Severe depression can cause symptoms of psychosis - losing contact with reality. Symptoms of psychosis in depression include:
Delusions: strongly-held beliefs that are false or unlikely to be true. For example, someone with psychotic depression might believe that they are dying, or have already died.
Delusions: strongly-held beliefs that are false or unlikely to be true. For example, someone with psychotic depression might believe that they are dying, or have already died.
Hallucinations: hearing, seeing, or smelling things that are not really there. For example, someone with psychotic depression might hear voices criticising them.

Causes of depression
We don't know exactly why depression happens. It's likely that many different things are involved, and these probably differ from person-to-person. Anyone can develop depression. Some people are more prone to it and it can develop for no apparent reason. You may have no particular problem or worry, but depression symptoms can develop quite suddenly.
An episode of depression may be triggered by:
Genetics - meaning the condition is passed on through families.

Life events - such as relationship problems, bereavement, redundancy, illness, etc.

Alcohol and drugs.

Loneliness.

It's often difficult to identify one single trigger for an episode of depression. More commonly, it's a mixture of different things.
Women tend to develop depression more often than men. Particularly common times for women to become depressed are after childbirth (postnatal depression) and the menopause.
Depression and physical conditions
Mental and physical health are very closely linked. It can be difficult to tell symptoms of depression apart from symptoms caused by other 'physical' health conditions.
Depression is more common in people with long-term physical health conditions. There's likely a two-way relationship between depression and other health conditions; having a long-term physical health condition can increase the risk of depression, and depression can make the physical health condition worse. For example, people with heart disease are more likely to have a heart attack if they also have depression, compared to people who have heart disease but don't have depression.
So, depression, and mental health problems generally, are important to identify and treat in people with other long-term conditions.
Undiagnosed physical conditions
Various physical conditions may at first seem to mimic depression. Doctors aim to be on the lookout for these diseases and may order tests to rule them out if one is suspected. Perhaps the most common examples are:
An underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) - can make you feel quite low, weepy and tired. A blood test can diagnose this.

An underactive pituitary gland (hypopituitarism) - the pituitary gland is just under the brain. It makes various hormones which have various actions. Sometimes one hormone can be deficient; sometimes more than one. There are various symptoms that can develop. These include loss of sex drive, sexual problems, infertility, uncontrollable weight gain and feeling low, depressed and even suicidal. Blood tests can help to diagnose hypopituitarism. There are various causes of hypopituitarism, including head injury.

Head injury - even a relatively mild one, even many years ago. For example, studies have shown that rates of suicide (presumably related to depression) are more common than average in people who have previously had a head injury. The reason for this is not fully understood. However, one factor that may be significant in some cases is that a head injury may result in hypopituitarism, as discussed above.

Depression severity
The severity of depression can vary from person to person. Severity can be divided up as:
Mild depression
People with mild depression have either low mood or loss of interest in their usual activities, alongside other depressive symptoms listed above. They may have some difficulty functioning in some parts of daily life.
Moderate depression
People with moderate depression have either low mood or loss of interest in their usual activities, alongside other depressive symptoms. They either have a large number of milder depressive symptoms, or a small number of more severe symptoms. They tend to have significant difficulties functioning in daily life.
Severe depression
People with severe depression have many or all of the symptoms of depression at a high degree, or they may have a smaller number of very intense depressive symptoms. They have serious difficulties functioning in day-to-day life.
Subthreshold depression
Whilst it's not in the current international classification of depression, some doctors find the concept of 'subthreshold depression' helpful. In subthreshold depression, there are some symptoms of depression, but they aren't severe enough to meet the criteria for depression. However, they can still be troublesome and cause distress. If this situation persists for more than two years it is sometimes called dysthymia.
In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends categorising depression as being either 'less severe' or 'more severe':
Less severe depression includes subthreshold and mild depression.
Less severe depression includes subthreshold and mild depression.
More severe depression includes moderate and severe depression.
More severe depression includes moderate and severe depression.
Questionnaires can also be used to estimate the severity of depression symptoms. A commonly-used one is called the Patient Health Questionnaire 9, or PHQ-9.
How is depression diagnosed?
Depression is diagnosed based on your symptoms. Some people also show physical signs of depression, such as being tearful or withdrawn. Sometimes, information from other people that know you can be helpful in making the diagnosis.
Other tests, such as blood tests or scans, are rarely needed, and only done if it's thought that another condition might be present, or the symptoms of depression are not typical.
There are a few different diagnostic criteria for depression. One major international definition (ICD-11) states that depression can be diagnosed if someone has at least five out of ten of the following symptoms, present for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. One of the symptoms must be a depressed mood, or significantly reduced interest in, or pleasure from, normal activities. The ten symptoms are:
A depressed (low) mood.

Significantly reduced interest or pleasure in normal activities.

Depression treatment
In general, treating depression involves a combination of medication, talking therapies, and lifestyle changes. Recommended treatment will be based on your individual circumstances, your wishes, and how severe your depression is.
The treatment options for depression include:
Self-care and lifestyle changes.

Lifestyle changes and self-care
Living with depression can be extremely difficult. Making time for self-care is important. Lifestyle changes can help the symptoms of depression, particularly mild depression. They can be difficult to do when experiencing depression, but it's useful to try doing these, especially alongside the other treatments, as they can be an important part of recovery. See "Living with depression", below, for specific tips.
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
CBT is a very widely-used type of talking therapy treatment for depression and anxiety. This usually consists of eight to twelve regular sessions, either individually or with other people in the group. CBT focuses on the 'here and now' - it's not designed to look at what happened in the past, but rather focuses on how you are thinking and behaving right now. It looks at how thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, feelings and behaviour interact, and teaches coping skills to deal with things in life differently.
CBT techniques can help to break negative thought patterns.
For example, let's say you pass a friend in the street who walks past without acknowledging you. You might have an immediate negative thought, such as "she doesn't like me", or "I've done something wrong to upset her". That might lead to negative emotions of sadness and worthlessness, and might trigger other negative thoughts, such as "nobody likes me". Some people might spend the whole day ruminating about what happened.
CBT techniques can help to re-frame the situation. Instead of an immediate negative thought, you might use techniques to evaluate the situation. Are there other explanations for why your friend behaved that way? Perhaps she didn't see you. Perhaps she's very busy and stressed herself, and distracted. If that initial thought changes, the outcome can be entirely different; instead of feeling sad and guilty for the rest of the day, your mood might be unaffected. You might even give the friend a call later to check if she's OK.
Guided self-help
This involves printed or digital materials that include structured cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), structured behavioural activation (BA), problem-solving, and materials to help you understand your mental health difficulties.
Behavioural activation (BA)
This usually consists of eight regular sessions, either individually or with up to eight people in the group. It focuses on identifying the link between your activities and your mood. It helps you to recognise patterns and plan practical changes that reduce avoidance and that focus on behaviours that are linked to improved mood.
Group exercise
This uses a physical activity programme specifically designed for people with depression. It usually consists of more than one session per week for 10 weeks. There are usually eight participants in the group and includes moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. Exercise improves depressive and anxiety symptoms. See also the separate leaflet called Exercise and Physical Activity.
Group mindfulness and meditation
This uses a programme such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy specifically designed for people with depression. It usually consists of eight regular sessions, with 8-15 participants in the group. The focus is on concentrating on the present, observing and sitting with thoughts and feelings and bodily sensations, and breathing exercises.
Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)
This usually consists of 8-6 regular sessions, although additional sessions may be needed if you also have other mental or physical health problems or complex social needs. The focus is on identifying how interpersonal relationships or circumstances are related to feelings of depression, exploring emotions and how you respond to others.
Counselling
This usually consists of eight regular sessions, although additional sessions may be needed for people with comorbid mental or physical health problems or complex social needs, or to address residual symptoms. The focus is on emotional processing and finding emotional meaning, to help people find their own solutions and develop coping mechanisms.
Short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP)
This usually consists of 8-16 regular sessions, although additional sessions may be needed if you also have other mental or physical health problems or complex social needs. The focus is on recognising difficult feelings in significant relationships and stressful situations, and identifying how patterns can be repeated.
Couple therapy
This may be an option for people who have a regular partner and where the relationship contributes to the depression, or, where involving the partner is considered to be of potential useful benefit.
Antidepressant medication
Antidepressant medication is one option for depression treatment. They have less benefit in less severe depression (subthreshold or mild depression) and so are usually kept as a second-line treatment in case talking therapy doesn't help. For more severe depression (moderate or severe depression), they might be recommended amongst the treatment options from the outset.
The most commonly-used type of antidepressants are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as sertraline, citalopram, fluoxetine, escitalopram and paroxetine. They take about two weeks before producing any benefit in mood or anxiety symptoms. They should usually be continued for at least six months after the symptoms improve, to reduce the risk of them coming back again; although some people take them for longer.
Other commonly-used antidepressants are serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as venlafaxine. Older antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline) are not used very often for depression any more, although may be used for other conditions.
Antidepressants can improve depressive symptoms such as low mood, poor sleep, and poor concentration. This can improve daily functioning and make it easier to deal with difficult circumstances.
Antidepressants are generally safe medications, but they have side-effects. See the Antidepressants leaflet for more.
What if I don't have any treatment?
Most people with depression will get better without treatment. However, this may take several months or even longer. (The average length of an episode of depression is 6-8 months.) Meanwhile, living with depression can be difficult and distressing (and also for your family and friends).
Relationships, employment, etc, may be seriously affected. There is also a danger that some people turn to alcohol or illegal drugs. Some people think of suicide. Therefore, many people with depression opt for treatment.
How to treat severe depression
More severe depression is often treated with a combination of CBT and antidepressant medication.
The options for treating more severe depression are otherwise similar to less severe depression but the treatments used are provided for longer periods of time.
Other treatments
For people with psychotic depression, antipsychotic medications are often used alongside antidepressants.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is sometimes used for people with severe depression which has not improved with other treatments. It can have side-effects, but can be life-saving for people who are very seriously ill with depression, when other treatments aren't working for them.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) involves using magnetic fields to temporarily activate and deactivate parts of the brain. It's sometimes used for people with severe depression if other treatments - talking therapy and medications - haven't worked.
St John's wort for depression
This is generally not advised. St John's wort (hypericum) is a herbal antidepressant that you can buy, without a prescription, from pharmacies. It became a popular treatment for depression. However, the UK's national guidelines for depression advise against using it because:
It is not clear how well it works. Although some studies suggest that it may help depression, other studies have failed to confirm this.

Side-effects sometimes occur. (Some people think that because St John's wort is 'natural' then it is totally safe. This is not true. It contains many chemicals which sometimes cause problems.)

It may react with other medicines that you may take. Sometimes the reactions can cause serious problems. For example, you should not take St John's wort if you are taking warfarin, ciclosporin, oral contraceptives, anticonvulsants, digoxin, theophylline, or certain anti-HIV medicines. Also, you should not take it at the same time as certain other prescribed antidepressants.

Living with depression
Living with depression can be really difficult. But making time for self-care can help to manage the symptoms, particularly alongside other treatments. Things to try include:
Try to exercise. Exercise can have a powerful effect on people's mood. Even a little bit of gentle exercise can help, such as starting with gentle stretches or chair-based exercises.

Try to avoid alcohol and other drugs such as cannabis or cocaine. People often use these to cope with feelings of depression, but they tend to make depression worse in the long run. Using alcohol or drugs regularly also makes it very hard to assess and treat depression.

Don't bottle things up and 'go it alone'. Try to tell people who are close to you how you feel. It is not weak to cry or admit that you are struggling.

Sometimes a spell off work is needed. However, too long off work might not be so good, as dwelling on problems and brooding at home may make things worse. Getting back into the hurly-burly of normal life may help the healing process when things are improving. Each person is different and the ability to work will vary. Consider seeing if you can work part-time or with amended duties until recovered.

Sometimes a specific psychological problem can cause depression but some people are reluctant to mention it. One example is sexual abuse as a child, leading to depression or psychological difficulties as an adult. Tell your doctor if you feel something like this is the root cause of your depression. Counselling may be available for such problems.

Counselling may be available for such problems.
Understanding that your symptoms are due to depression, may help you to accept that you are ill and need help. Some people ask: "Am I going mad?" It may be a relief to know that you are not going mad and that the symptoms you have are common and have been shared by many other people.
You may 'bottle up' your symptoms from friends and relatives. However, if you are open about your feelings with close family and friends, it may help them to understand and help.
Will it happen again?
A one-off episode of depression at some stage in life is common. However, some people have two, three, or more episodes of depression.
You can have treatment for each episode. But, if you are prone to repeated episodes of depression, options that may be considered by you and your doctor include the following:
To take an antidepressant long-term to help prevent depression from returning.

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. This may be advised (if available) for people who are currently well but have had three or more episodes of depression. This therapy is a specialist type of talking treatment. There is good evidence that it can help to prevent depression returning.

Conditions related to depression
Postnatal depression
Some women develop depression just after having a baby. See the separate leaflet called Postnatal Depression.
Bipolar disorder
In some people, depression can alternate with periods of elation and overactivity (mania or hypomania). This is called bipolar disorder (sometimes called manic depression). Treatment tends to include mood stabilising medicines such as lithium. See the separate leaflet called Bipolar Disorder.
Seasonal affective disorder
Sometimes depression can be triggered by certain times of the year such as Christmas, in the new year or summer. Some people develop recurrent depression in the winter months only. This is called seasonal affective disorder (SAD). See the separate leaflet called Seasonal Affective Disorder.
Other mental health problems
Depression sometimes occurs at the same time as other mental health problems:
People with anxiety, panic disorder and personality disorders quite commonly also develop depression. As a rule, depression should be treated first, followed by treatment of the other disorder. In particular, anxiety will often improve following treatment of depression.

Meets Patient’s editorial guidelines
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) causes problems with concentrating (inattention), and being too active and having difficulty staying focused (hyperactivity). The difficulties caused by ADHD vary from mild to severe.
Although ADHD starts in childhood, the difficulties often persist into adulthood. Sometimes adults are diagnosed with ADHD for the first time because the problems have not been properly assessed and the diagnosis not made during childhood.
Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is a term used for people who have excessive difficulties with concentration without other ADHD symptoms such as excessive impulsiveness or hyperactivity.

What is ADHD in adults?
ADHD is a pattern of behaviours which first appear during childhood, and the symptoms of ADHD include:
Overactivity.

Being unable to concentrate for any length of time.
Many of us might have one or more of these features but they are more severe and cause problems with day-to-day activities for people with ADHD. In ADHD, these difficulties interfere with how you get on with other people, and how you get on at work.
ADHD tends to get better as affected children become adults. The overactivity usually gets less, but the impulsivity, poor concentration and risk-taking can get worse. These can make it hard to work, learn and get on with other people.
Adults with ADHD are more likely to experience other problems and mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, mood swings, feelings of low self-esteem and substance abuse, and can feel overwhelmed and struggle, especially in less structured environments.
How common is ADHD in adults?
About 5 in every 100 school-aged children have ADHD. The symptoms of childhood ADHD persist into adulthood in up to 65 in 100 children with ADHD. Therefore ADHD affects about 3-4 in 100 adults.
In children, boys are more commonly diagnosed than girls, whereas in adults, there are more equal numbers of men and women who are known to have ADHD.
See also the separate leaflet Dispelling common ADHD myths and stereotypes.
What are the symptoms of ADHD in adults?
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is suspected in adults if there are at least five inattention symptoms and/or at least five hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms that have:

The classification for ADHD used in the UK is the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11). In the USA, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) is used.
See the separate article What are the signs of ADHD in women? for more details.
How is ADHD diagnosed in adults?
If you have become aware of problems that may indicate ADHD as an adult, your GP should refer you to see a mental health professional with expertise in ADHD in either a local Community Mental Health Team or a Neurodevelopmental Service. This is often a psychiatrist but may also be a specialist nurse or psychologist.
The assessment will focus on the problems you are having, whether they confirm that you do have ADHD or not, and how troublesome they are.
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults may be associated with other mental health problems (including mood and anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and personality disorders) that may make diagnosis and the treatment of adult ADHD more difficult.
What causes ADHD in adults?
ADHD is the extreme of behavioural traits that are common. Genetics play an important role in whether someone has ADHD. There are also lots of other factors involved, including social and environmental factors. Therefore ADHD can occur in different ways:
Common genetic variants interact with environmental factors, resulting in the features of ADHD.
Common genetic variants interact with environmental factors, resulting in the features of ADHD.
Very occasionally, someone will have ADHD because they have rare genetic variants, irrespective of any environmental factors.
Very occasionally, someone will have ADHD because they have rare genetic variants, irrespective of any environmental factors.
Family studies have found that the risk of being diagnosed with ADHD is nine times higher in brothers or sisters (siblings) of someone with ADHD, when compared to siblings of someone without ADHD.
People who have other disorders affecting the development of the nervous system, such as autistic spectrum disorder (autism) are also more likely to have ADHD than people who don’t. Studies have found common genetic risk factors for ADHD and autism.
Environmental factors most strongly associated with ADHD are low birth weight and maternal smoking during pregnancy. Other risk factors include preterm delivery, epilepsy, brain injury, lead exposure, iron deficiency, fetal alcohol exposure during pregnancy, psychological and social problems, and poor maternal mental health.
How to treat ADHD in adults
Medication will usually be offered if ADHD symptoms are causing significant difficulties. Either lisdexamfetamine or methylphenidate are usually offered as first choice, with dexamfetamine or atomoxetine as possible alternatives if lisdexamfetamine and/or methylphenidate can't be used, are not tolerated because of side-effects, or are ineffective.
Treating adults with ADHD by using alternative methods to medications may also be considered:
These treatments may include a structured supportive psychological intervention focused on ADHD, regular follow-up either in person or by phone, and cognitive behavioural therapy.

If you are becoming very distressed or depressed because of your symptoms, your GP can refer you to a community mental health team or counsellor.
Self-help
There are a number of things that often help adults with ADHD to overcome any difficulties and these include:
Making lists, keeping a diary, using stick-up reminders, and setting aside some time to plan what you need to do.

Can ADHD get worse in adults?
Adult ADHD symptoms tend to get generally better as you get older. However, although the overactivity usually gets less, the impulsivity, poor concentration and risk taking can get worse. These can make it hard to work, learn and get on with other people. Therefore, the difficulties caused by ADHD may get worse because of the impact on activities with friends, family and at work.
