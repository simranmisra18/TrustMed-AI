My 77 year old husband has diabetes, heart disease, and has been having sustained heart rate measurements of 43 for long period of time. He has COPD as well.
What can happen if I can’t convince him to go to his cardiologist about this? I worry about him having a heart attack or stroke. Any information is appreciated.
