There are three main types of painkiller: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), paracetamol and opioids. Each works in a different way. Most people only need to take painkillers for a few days or weeks at most, but some people need to take them for a long time. Some painkillers are available over the counter from pharmacies; this includes some NSAIDs, paracetamol and some weak opioids (codeine or dihydrocodeine).

What are painkillers?
Painkillers are medicines that are used to treat pain. There are a large number of painkillers available and they all have various brands. They can be taken:
By mouth as liquids, tablets, or capsules.

Some painkillers are also available as creams, ointments, gels or patches.
Types of painkillers
Even though there are a large number of painkillers available, there are only three main types (each works in a different way). They are:
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen, diclofenac and naproxen. Aspirin is also an NSAID; however, it is mainly prescribed (in low doses) to help to keep the blood from clotting - for example, for people who have had a heart attack in the past.

Weak opioids and strong opioids (sometimes called opiates). Examples of weak opioids include codeine and dihydrocodeine. Although commonly described as 'weak opioids', they are extremely effective analgesics often used to treat severe pain; however, they can lead to significant addiction and adverse effects, so should not be underestimated. Examples of strong opioids include morphine, buprenorphine, oxycodone, pethidine and tramadol.

Examples of strong opioids include morphine, buprenorphine, oxycodone, pethidine and tramadol.
Different types of painkillers are sometimes combined together into one tablet - for example, paracetamol plus codeine (co-codamol).
In addition to the above, some antidepressants and antiepileptic medicines can be used to treat neuropathic pain. The rest of this leaflet does not discuss these types of medicines.

For more information on them see the separate leaflet called Neuropathic pain (Neuralgia).
There are also other alternative methods for pain relief such as, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machine.

See the separate leaflet called TENS machines.
Treatment and medication
Many common infections are caused by germs called viruses. Antibiotic medicines do not kill viruses. Also, many infections caused by germs called bacteria do not need antibiotics. These infections often get better without antibiotic treatment. Excessive use of antibiotics may allow the germs to become resistant to the antibiotic medicines, so that they will not work when they really are needed. They may also sometimes cause side-effects. This is why antibiotics are not prescribed for many infections.
by Dr Mary Harding, MRCGP
Treatment and medication
Minor illness and mild aches or pains are common. It is useful to keep a few medicines at home in case you need something when you can't get to a pharmacy, or they are closed. Always read the labels carefully and follow the instructions, and store the medicines out of the reach of children. Your pharmacist is a good person to give you more information about over-the-counter medicines which do not need a prescription from your doctor. See your doctor if your symptoms get worse or do not go away.
by Dr Hayley Willacy, FRCGP
How do painkillers work?
NSAIDs work by blocking (inhibiting) the effect of chemicals (enzymes) called cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes. COX enzymes help to make other chemicals called prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are involved in the production of pain and inflammation at sites of injury or damage. A reduction in prostaglandin production reduces both pain and inflammation. Not all NSAIDs are exactly the same, and some work in slightly different ways from others.
See the separate leaflet called Anti-inflammatory tablets (NSAIDs) for more details.
Paracetamol. No one really knows for sure exactly how paracetamol works. But it is also thought to work by blocking COX enzymes in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). Paracetamol is used to treat pain and to lower a high temperature. However, it does not help with inflammation.
Opioids work by binding to certain receptors (opioid receptors) in the central nervous system, the gut and other parts of the body. This leads to a decrease in the way pain is felt and responded to, and it increases tolerance to pain.

See the separate leaflet called Strong painkillers (Opioids) for more details.
Which painkiller is usually prescribed?
The type of painkiller a doctor will prescribe depends upon:
The type of pain.
The type of pain.
Any other health problems.
Any other health problems.
The severity of the pain.
The severity of the pain.
The possible side-effects of the medicines.
The possible side-effects of the medicines.
Painkillers such as paracetamol are normally advised or prescribed if the pain is mild or moderate and there is no inflammation.
NSAIDs are generally advised or prescribed for people who have pain along with inflammation - for example, if where there is pain in the joints (arthritis) or muscles (back pain). NSAIDs have a number of possible side-effects and they are not suitable for everyone. For example, they are not suitable for people who have or have had stomach ulcers. In this case a doctor may advise a safer medicine (paracetamol) even though it may not work as well. NSAIDs can be used with heat and ice treatment in joint, muscle or ligament injuries.

See the separate leaflet called Ice and heat therapy for pain relief.
Weak opioids are usually prescribed for more severe pain, or if other painkillers have not worked.
Stronger opioids are normally used to treat severe pain - for example, cancer-related pain, pain after an operation, or after a serious injury.
Anti-inflammatory medicines used as a cream (topical painkillers) are mainly used to treat pain in the soft tissues and muscles.

See the separate leaflet called Topical anti-inflammatory painkillers for more details.
How should I take painkillers?
People who are in constant pain are often recommended to take painkillers regularly. For example, if paracetamol has been prescribed it will normally be taken four times a day, every day, until the pain is better. Otherwise, painkillers should only be taken when needed.
For some chronic pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia and chronic tension headache, regular painkillers are not recommended. This is because non-medication treatments can be more helpful for these conditions and painkillers may even make the condition worse.
In 2021, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated several of its guidances on painful conditions, including low back pain and sciatica. These highlight some of the risks of side effects of pain medications, including addiction with strong (opioid) painkillers.
This means that doctors will recommend taking painkillers for the shortest time possible, in the lowest dose that is effective. Any concerns should be discussed with a doctor or pharmacist.
NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or diclofenac should be taken with or after food. This is because they can irritate the lining of the stomach and sometimes cause bleeding in the stomach. In some circumstances another medication will be prescribed alongside the NSAID (a proton pump inhibitor or PPI) to protect the stomach from irritation.
What is the usual length of treatment?
Painkillers should be taken for the shortest period of time possible, in the lowest dose that controls the pain. This is to help avoid any side-effects. Most people only need to take painkillers for a few days (for example, for toothache) or weeks (having pulled a muscle). However, some people have painful conditions and may need to take painkillers on a long-term basis. Examples include people with osteoarthritis or chronic back pain.
Side-effects of painkillers
It is not possible to list all the possible side-effects of each painkiller in this leaflet. However, as with all medicines, there are a number of side-effects that have been reported with each of the different painkillers. The information leaflet which comes with medication will have more details.
NSAIDs
Most people who take anti-inflammatories, at least in the short term, have no side-effects, or only minor ones. When taken appropriately, the benefits usually far outweigh the potential harms. In particular, many people take a short course of an anti-inflammatory for all sorts of painful conditions. However, side-effects, and sometimes very serious possible adverse effects, can occur. These include bleeding into the stomach and gut, and cardiovascular or kidney problems.
See the separate leaflet called Anti-inflammatory tablets (NSAIDs) for more details.
Paracetamol
This is a safe medicine and side-effects are very rare if the maximum recommended dose is not exceeded. However, paracetamol can be very dangerous if too much is taken (overdose). Overdoses of paracetamol can happen by mistake, but some people intentionally take an overdose. The main effect of an overdose of paracetamol is that it can damage the liver permanently and can cause death.
Opioids
The most common side-effects are:
Feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) - particularly at the start of treatment.
Feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) - particularly at the start of treatment.
Constipation.
Constipation.
Dry mouth.
Dry mouth.
Opioids can also cause drowsiness and confusion. People often become tolerant to opioid painkillers (needing to take more to get the same effect) and then depend upon them. This includes opioids that can be bought in pharmacies.
See the separate leaflet called Strong Painkillers (Opioids) for more details.
Some painkillers may interact with other medicines. This may cause reactions, or reduce the effectiveness of one or other of the treatments.
Can I buy painkillers?
Various painkillers can be bought, including paracetamol and some NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen, aspirin and naproxen). Weaker opioids, such as codeine, are only available to buy in combination with paracetamol or ibuprofen. The dose of codeine in these combination tablets is lower than the doses that are available on prescription. It is only possible to buy a few days' supply of the weaker opioid combination tablets. If these are needed more than three days then this should be discussed with a doctor or pharmacist.
A prescription is needed for weaker opioids that are not in combination with paracetamol; most NSAIDs (for example, indometacin, or diclofenac), as well as stronger opioids (for example, morphine, diamorphine and tramadol) and opioid patches.
Who cannot take painkillers?
It is very rare for anyone not to be able to take some type of painkiller. The main reason why a painkiller might need to be avoided is following a serious side-effect or an allergic reaction to a particular type of painkiller in the past. Even if this has happened, a different type of painkiller will usually be available.
Aspirin cannot be taken by children under the age of 16 years, because there is a very small risk of the child developing a serious condition called Reye's syndrome.
Frequently asked questions
People frequently have questions about taking painkillers, particularly when buying them over the counter. Pharmacists are very well placed to answer most of these questions at the time but some common questions are answered below.
It is safe to take painkillers with antibiotics. It is often recommended, as simple painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen can reduce fever as well as pain. Some antibiotics can cause side effects such as abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea in which case NSAIDs should be avoided; paracetamol is a safer option.
Blood pressure which is well controlled on medication does not cause a problem with painkillers. Uncontrolled blood pressure increases the risk of strokes and therefore medications such as NSAIDs might be advised against due to the risk of bleeding. However paracetamol is safe in this instance.
Paracetamol is safe throughout pregnancy. NSAIDs are not recommended in the first trimester (up to around 14 weeks of pregnancy) or the last trimester (from around 28 weeks of pregnancy). Codeine is also usually considered safe in pregnancy though the lowest possible dose is always advised and should be discussed with a doctor - the codeine does pass through to the baby in the womb. There is some evidence of babies being born with neural tube defects (a problem with the spine and the nerves coming from the spine) if codeine is used early in pregnancy and of some babies showing signs of opiate withdrawal if it is used late in pregnancy.
NSAIDs can cause damage to kidneys. This is most likely when taken for long periods of time and in older people, particularly those whose kidneys already have some damage. People who are known to have kidney disease would usually be advised to take paracetamol (and opiates if necessary). People on long term NSAIDs would normally be advised to have annual blood tests to check their kidney function.
Nerve pain does not often respond well to standard painkillers. This is why newer medications such as anti-epilepsy medication or anti-depressants may be used for this type of pain. These medications work particularly well for nerve pain.
Painkillers usually start working within a few minutes and then start wearing off again within a few hours. To avoid the pain coming and going, it is usually best to take painkillers regularly (for example, for an earache or toothache) as this works best at keeping pain at bay. This is not the recommendation for all long-term pain and can make some conditions, such as chronic daily headaches, worse rather than better.

Antibiotics are medicines that treat bacterial infections, but they don’t work against viruses like colds or flu. Using the right antibiotic correctly and completing the full course helps ensure recovery and prevent resistance. This leaflet explains how antibiotics work, when they are prescribed, the types available, how to take them, and possible risks.

Antibiotics by injection
People who need to have an antibiotic by injection will have this started in hospital due to a severe infection. Sometimes the hospital team will continue overseeing antibiotics by injection after leaving hospital, particularly if the course of antibiotics needs to be continued for several weeks.
Do antibiotics work on viruses?
It is important to remember that antibiotics are only prescribed to treat bacterial infections and are not effective against viruses. Antibiotics simply do not work against infections that are caused by viruses (for example, the common cold or flu), or fungi (for example, thrush in the mouth or vagina), or fungal infections of the skin.
People who have been prescribed antibiotics for viral infections often think they have helped but this is just because the viral infection has got better in its normal timeframe, not because the antibiotics have made any difference.
Very occasionally, a viral infection or minor bacterial infection can develop into a more serious secondary bacterial infection. In this case, antibiotics would be needed.
Types of antibiotics
There are various antibiotics available and each comes with different brand names, depending on the manufacturer. Antibiotics are usually grouped together based on how they work. Each type of antibiotic only works against certain types of bacteria or parasites. This is why different antibiotics are used to treat different types of infection. The main types of antibiotics include:
Penicillins - for example, phenoxymethylpenicillin, flucloxacillin and amoxicillin.
Penicillins - for example, phenoxymethylpenicillin, flucloxacillin and amoxicillin.

Treatment and medication
If you had a bad reaction to a medicine or medical device, or suspected it was unsafe in any way, would you know how to report it? For this #MedSafetyWeek we find out about the MHRA Yellow Card scheme - a quick and simple way of reporting suspected problems with medicine in the UK. A small action from you can keep our medicines reliable, and prevent others from future harm.

Treatment and medication
Steroid medicines (sometimes referred to as corticosteroids) are man-made (synthetic) versions of steroid hormones produced by the body. There are several different forms of steroid medicines. The form discussed in this leaflet is the tablet form, taken by mouth, called oral steroids. Other types of steroids include creams, ointments, injections, inhalers and sprays. These are discussed in the separate leaflets called Topical steroids (excluding inhaled steroids), Topical steroids for eczema and Asthma inhalers.
by Dr Philippa Vincent, MRCGP
How do antibiotics work?
Some antibiotics work by killing bacteria (or parasites). This is often done by interfering with the structure of the cell wall of the bacterium or parasite. Some work by stopping bacteria or the parasite from multiplying.
When are antibiotics usually prescribed?
When do I need antibiotics for a sore throat?
Antibiotics are normally only prescribed for relatively serious bacterial infections.
Most common infections are caused by viruses. Even a mild bacterial infection will usually be cleared by the immune system without the need for antibiotics. For example, antibiotics usually do little to speed up recovery from most ear, nose, throat and sinus infections even where they are caused by bacteria.
However, antibiotics are needed for certain more serious infections caused by bacteria, such as meningitis or pneumonia. In these situations, antibiotics are often life-saving. Doctors are skilled at examining people to rule out serious illness and to advise if an antibiotic is needed. Urine infections also commonly need antibiotics to prevent spread to the kidneys.
Antibiotics can also be prescribed to treat acne. For acne, antibiotics can be taken by mouth or applied directly to the skin.
Which antibiotic is usually prescribed?
The choice of antibiotic mainly depends on where the infection is and which bacteria is likely to be causing the infection. This is because each antibiotic is effective only against certain bacteria and parasites.
For example, in pneumonia, the doctor knows what kinds of bacteria typically cause most cases of pneumonia. He or she will choose the antibiotic that best combats those kinds of bacteria.
There are other factors that influence the choice of an antibiotic. These include:
How severe the infection is.

How to take antibiotics
It is important to take antibiotics in the correct way. Failing to do this may reduce how well they work. For example, some antibiotics need to be taken with food and others should be taken on an empty stomach.
Taking antibiotics incorrectly will affect how much of them get into the body (their absorption) and therefore they may not work as well. It is important always to follow the instructions given by the doctor or pharmacist, and on the leaflet that comes with the antibiotic prescribed.
It is also important always to take the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed. Even though it is common to feel better before the medicine is entirely finished, it is necessary to follow through and take the entire course. This is important for healing as, if an antibiotic is stopped in mid-course, germs (bacteria) may be partially treated and not completely killed. Bacteria may then become resistant to that antibiotic.
Overuse of antibiotics has led to some bacteria changing their form or structure (mutating) and becoming resistant to some antibiotics, which may then not work when really needed. For example, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacterium that has become resistant to many different antibiotics and is difficult to treat. Other bacteria produce chemicals called enzymes such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) which allow them to be resistant to certain antibiotics.
Resistance to antibiotics has become a major health threat globally, as antibiotics are life-saving for serious illnesses. So if a health professional says antibiotics are not needed for your condition, please do not ask for them or attempt to get them elsewhere. Your health professional will explain in what circumstances antibiotics might be needed and what symptoms should prompt a return for another check.
If a secondary infection develops, antibiotics may be needed after all. Health professionals follow guidelines to help reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics.
Side-effects of antibiotics
It is not possible in this leaflet to list all the possible side-effects of each antibiotic. However, as with all medicines, there are a number of side-effects that have been reported with each of the different antibiotics.
Most side-effects of antibiotics are not serious but can be very troublesome. Common side-effects include:
Soft stools (faeces).
Soft stools (faeces).
Diarrhoea.
Diarrhoea.
Feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting.
Feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting.
Less commonly, some people have an allergic reaction to an antibiotic, for example an itchy rash. Severe allergic reactions can be fatal, but this is relatively rare. Allergy to penicillin accounts for three quarters of all deaths from anaphylaxis annually in the USA and causes deaths in approximately 2 per 100,000 people prescribed penicillin each year.
Antibiotics also kill off normal defence bacteria which live in the bowel and vagina. This may then allow thrush to grow and also disrupt the gut biome, potentially for months after a single course.
Some other significant side effects are:
Severe watery diarrhoea and tummy (abdominal) cramps: signs of a serious bacterial infection of the gut - Clostridium difficile infection - which is caused by antibiotic use.
Severe watery diarrhoea and tummy (abdominal) cramps: signs of a serious bacterial infection of the gut - Clostridium difficile infection - which is caused by antibiotic use.
Shortness of breath, hives, rash, swelling (of the lips, face, or tongue), fainting: signs of an allergic reaction. (Call 999 or seek very urgent medical attention if suffering from shortness of breath or any tongue, lip or throat swelling).
Shortness of breath, hives, rash, swelling (of the lips, face, or tongue), fainting: signs of an allergic reaction. (Call 999 or seek very urgent medical attention if suffering from shortness of breath or any tongue, lip or throat swelling).
White patches on the tongue: signs of oral thrush.
White patches on the tongue: signs of oral thrush.
Do antibiotics make you tired?
Pneumonia, and the other serious bacterial illnesses for which antibiotics are used, frequently cause tiredness. Antibiotics can often cause side effects such as diarrhoea or nausea which can cause tiredness. Occasionally, they can cause tiredness as a side effect.
Can antibiotics cause swelling?
Some people can develop swelling as an allergic reaction to antibiotics. Mild cases affect the face or lips, but sudden or severe swelling needs urgent medical help.
Interactions
Some antibiotics may interact with other medications. This may cause reactions, or reduce the effectiveness of one or other of the treatments.
Oral contraceptive pill
In the past it was recommended that additional contraception should be used if taking antibiotics whilst on the combined oral contraceptive pill. This is no longer the current recommendation after more recent evidence has been reviewed.
Antibiotics (other than one called rifampicin which is rarely prescribed and never in general practice) do not interfere with the effectiveness of the pill. The pill should be continued as normal.
How to get antibiotics
In the UK they are generally only available from a pharmacist, with a doctor's prescription. In some other parts of the world they are freely available over the counter. However, to reduce the problem of resistance due to inappropriate use of antibiotics, it is best to always obtain medical advice before buying antibiotics.
Antibiotic resistance is far more common in countries where they are available over the counter (typically in developing countries).
Can a pharmacist prescribe antibiotics?
It is possible to get a limited selection of antibiotics directly from your pharmacist, for example to treat a urinary tract infection in certain age groups.
How long do you take antibiotics for?
The length of treatment varies a lot. It depends on the type of infection, how severe it is and how quickly the symptoms resolve after starting treatment. Treatment can be:
For three days ('water' infection - urinary tract infection (UTI)).
For three days ('water' infection - urinary tract infection (UTI)).
For one or two weeks (pneumonia).
For one or two weeks (pneumonia).
For a few months (bone infections).
For a few months (bone infections).
For many months (acne).
For many months (acne).
Who cannot take antibiotics?
It is very rare for anyone not to be able to take some type of antibiotic. The main reason for not being able to take an antibiotic is a previous allergic reaction to an antibiotic. Even after an allergic reaction to one antibiotic, a doctor or health professional will be able to choose a different type of antibiotic if needed.
There are certain antibiotics which should not be taken in pregnancy, but a health professional will be able to advise on which one is suitable if an antibiotic is needed. Certain antibiotics may need to be avoided whilst taking other medication, or regular medication stopped whilst taking the antibiotic.
Frequently asked questions
How long do antibiotics stay in the system?
Most antibiotics leave the body through your pee or poo within 24 hours, but their effects on the gut bacteria can last for weeks or even months.
Can you feel better after one dose of antibiotics?
Antibiotics rarely work after just one dose. Quick relief may happen with urine or skin infections, but in most cases, feeling better that fast means antibiotics weren’t needed.
Can you take paracetamol with antibiotics?
It is usually safe to take paracetamol with most common antibiotics, it can help reduce pain or fever while the antibiotic treats the infection. However, always follow the recommended doses and check with a doctor or pharmacist.
Can you take antibiotics during pregnancy?
Some antibiotics, like penicillin and cephalosporins, are usually safe to take during pregnancy. Others, such as tetracyclines or ciprofloxacin, aren’t recommended. If you’re pregnant and need antibiotics, it’s always best to check with your doctor or midwife first.
Can you take antibiotics and drink alcohol?
It’s best to avoid alcohol whilst taking antibiotics. Some antibiotics, such as metronidazole, can cause severe nausea and vomiting if mixed with alcohol. Others, like trimethoprim or erythromycin, may also be affected. Most antibiotics don’t directly interact with alcohol, but drinking whilst you’re unwell can slow recovery and make side effects worse.

Topical steroids
Topical steroids are used on the skin. See also the separate leaflet called Topical Steroids (excluding Inhaled Steroids).
Topical steroids used for the skin are available as creams, ointments or lotions. Topical steroids are used for various skin conditions. The amount of topical steroid that you should apply is commonly measured by fingertip units. For more information see the separate leaflets called Topical Steroids for Eczema and Fingertip Units for Topical Steroids.
Steroids can also be given as:
Eye drops to reduce inflammation on the surface of the eye such as caused by uveitis. These should only ever be started by a specialist eye doctor (ophthalmologist) who will usually have used a machine called a slit lamp to look into the back of your eye first.

Steroid nasal sprays
Steroid nasal sprays are medicines that are commonly used to treat symptoms of stuffiness or congestion in the nose. They are used most often for allergies of the nose, such as hay fever. They can be bought over the counter at a pharmacy - in general, treatment of hay fever should usually be bought over the counter rather than asking your GP for a prescription. See also the separate leaflet called Steroid Nasal Sprays.
Steroid inhalers
Steroid inhalers are steroids that are breathed in and down into your lungs. Inhaled steroids are mainly used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For more information see the separate leaflets called Inhalers for Asthma (including Inhaled Steroids) and Inhalers for COPD (including Inhaled Steroids).
Steroid injections
Steroid injections can be used for joint problems and rheumatoid arthritis. They can also be used for some conditions affecting soft tissues, like tendon inflammation or tennis elbow. They can sometimes be given at the GP practice, if there is a doctor, nurse or physio there who has had special training to do this. In more complicated situations they may be given in a hospital, using ultrasound guidance. For more information see the separate leaflet called Steroid Injections.
How do steroids work?
Steroids are a man-made version of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands, which are just above each kidney. When taken in doses higher than the amount your body normally produces, steroids:
Reduce inflammation
Inflammation occurs when the body's immune system responds to injury or infection. When this affects the skin and tissues under the skin then the area can become painful, hot, red and swollen. Inflammation usually helps to protect you but sometimes inflammation can cause harm to your body. Steroids can help to treat inflammatory conditions such as asthma and eczema - they are a type of anti-inflammatory drug.
Reduce the activity of the immune system
The immune system is the body's natural defence against illness and infection. This can help treat autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body.
Side-effects of steroids
Steroids don't tend to cause significant side-effects if they're taken for a short period of time or at a low dose. Side-effects are much more common with oral steroids or if you take them for a long time.Side-effects can include:
Indigestion (dyspepsia).

A short course of steroids can be taken and then stopped, but if using them for a long time, they must be slowly tapered off rather than stopping suddenly. Speak to your doctor if you are unclear about whether you need to taper your steroids - generally speaking if you have been taking them for more than a week or two, this might be necessary.

What are statins?
Statins are a group of medicines that are commonly used to reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood.
Types of statins
Statins available on prescription include:
Atorvastatin.
Atorvastatin.
Fluvastatin.
Fluvastatin.
Pravastatin.
Pravastatin.
Rosuvastatin.
Rosuvastatin.
Simvastatin.
Simvastatin.
They each have different brand names.
What are statins used for?
Your doctor will advise if you should take a statin. A statin is usually advised if:
You have a high cholesterol level (or high levels of other fats in the blood, called hyperlipidaemia - read more about hyperlipidaemia and familial hypercholesterolaemia).
You have a high cholesterol level (or high levels of other fats in the blood, called hyperlipidaemia - read more about hyperlipidaemia and familial hypercholesterolaemia).
You have an atheroma-related disease. This is a cardiovascular disease such as angina or peripheral arterial disease, or you have had a heart attack (myocardial infarction), stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). A statin helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease getting worse, or of you having further heart attacks, TIAs or strokes.

A statin helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease getting worse, or of you having further heart attacks, TIAs or strokes.
You have a high increased risk of developing heart disease. Risk is measured as a percentage. Risk is considered to be high when your score is 10% or more (that is, a 1 in 10 chance or more of developing a cardiovascular disease within the 10 years that follow). See the separate leaflet called Cardiovascular health risk assessment.

Risk is considered to be high when your score is 10% or more (that is, a 1 in 10 chance or more of developing a cardiovascular disease within the 10 years that follow). See the separate leaflet called Cardiovascular health risk assessment.
Note: a statin is just one factor in reducing your risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. See the separate leaflet called Cardiovascular disease (Atheroma).
What happens when you take a statin?
You should have a blood test before starting treatment. This checks the level of cholesterol. It also checks if your liver is working properly.
After starting treatment you should have a blood test in 2-3 months and again at 12 months. The blood test is to check that the liver has not been affected by the medication. The blood may also be checked to measure the cholesterol level to see how well the statin is working.
What is the target cholesterol level to aim for?
There is no actual target cholesterol blood level for people who do not already have cardiovascular disease. However, national guidelines recommend that people who have not been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, but would benefit from taking a statin to reduce their risk of this, should be started on atorvastatin 20 mg a day. This is a 'high-intensity' statin - the aim of giving high-intensity statins is to reduce your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (sometimes called the 'bad cholesterol') by at least 40%.
If you do have a cardiovascular disease the aim, if possible, is to reduce LDL cholesterol to less than 2.0 mmol/L, or non-HDL cholesterol to 2.6mmol/L or less. If the target is not reached at first, the dose may need to be increased or a different preparation used. National guidelines recommend that for people who have cardiovascular disease, the drug of choice is atorvastatin 80 mg a day.
A study of over 165,000 patients taking statins has shown that about half of people taking statins did not reduce their LDL cholesterol by at least 40%. There may be several reasons for this, including people not taking their statin tablets regularly. However, people who were not prescribed 'high-intensity statins' (such as atorvastatin 20-80 mg a day) were less likely to reach this target.
Once age and starting cholesterol level were taken into account, people who did not reach this 40% target were 22% more likely to have a heart attack or stroke over the following six years.
If you are taking a statin, you may want to ask your GP or practice nurse what your pre-treatment and on-treatment levels of LDL cholesterol are. If your cholesterol has not reduced by at least 40% on treatment, you could discuss your medication with your doctor.
Side-effects of statins
Most people who take a statin have no side-effects, or only minor ones. Read the information leaflet that comes with your medicine. It will have a full list of possible side-effects. It is always important to discuss the risks and benefits of any treatment with your healthcare professional or pharmacist.
Possible statin side-effects include:

Do's and don'ts of taking statins
Do
Tell your doctor if you have any unexpected muscle pains, tenderness, cramps or weakness. This is because a rare side-effect of statins is a severe form of muscle inflammation. Your doctor may need to adjust your dose of statin to reduce the risk.

Tell a doctor if you develop chest symptoms such as unexplained shortness of breath or cough. This is because (in very rare cases) statins may cause a disease called interstitial lung disease.

Remind your doctor or pharmacist you are on a statin if you are prescribed (or buy) another medication. This is because various other medicines may interfere with statins - for example, some antibiotics and ciclosporin. The doses of either the statin or the other interacting medicine may need to be adjusted.

Don't
Take a statin if you have active liver disease, if you are pregnant or intend to be pregnant, or if you are breastfeeding. You should stop a statin if you develop liver disease.

Eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice if you are taking some statins. A chemical in grapefruit can increase the level of statin in the bloodstream, which can make side-effects from the statin more likely. This is only a problem with simvastatin, atorvastatin and lovastatin. Other statins, such as pravastatin, do not interact with grapefruit.

Alternatives to statins
Statins are the most effective medicines for reducing cholesterol levels for most people. However, there are other medicines that are sometimes used if statins can't be used or aren't sufficiently effective. These include:
Ezetimibe is sometimes used in certain situations in combination with a statin, or on its own. It prevents the absorption of cholesterol from the gut. It is now recommended as the main alternative for people who cannot take statins

Bile acid sequestrants which include colestyramine, colesevelam and colestipol. They work by binding to bile acids which are passed into the gut from the liver and gallbladder. This stops bile acids being re-absorbed into the bloodstream, which has a knock-on effect of lowering cholesterol. Bile acid sequestrants may be used during pregnancy because they are safe while statins can't be used during pregnancy. They are not recommended routinely otherwise.

Fish oils may help to reduce blood lipid levels. These occur naturally in oily fish such as mackerel. This is why at least 1-2 portions of oily fish per week are recommended in a healthy diet. Dietary supplements ('fish oil tablets', which contain omega-3 fatty acids) are also available. However, the value of fish oil supplements is controversial, as the evidence from research trials is unclear.

However, the value of fish oil supplements is controversial, as the evidence from research trials is unclear.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended inclisiran, alirocumab or evolocumab as an option for reducing cholesterol in some patients with high cholesterol that has not responded to statins or ezetimibe.
NICE has also recommended a medication called icosapent ethyl for those people who:
Are already taking a statin.

Have controlled levels of LDL cholesterol.

Have high levels of triglycerides; and
Have high levels of triglycerides; and
Have a high risk of having a cardiovascular event.
Have a high risk of having a cardiovascular event.
This is because evidence has shown that icosapent ethyl reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in these people. See Further Reading below for more information.
Where to buy statins
Statin medicines are available on prescription and funded by the NHS in the UK if you have a cardiovascular disease, or you have a high risk of developing a cardiovascular disease. A statin is not usually prescribed for people with lower levels of risk.
Some statins are available to buy without a prescription. Some people choose to buy a statin to lower their cholesterol level.
However, statins are an addition and not a replacement for changing lifestyle factors to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. Everyone should follow a healthy lifestyle of not smoking, maintaining a healthy body weight, eating a healthy diet, getting regular physical exercise and only drinking alcohol in moderation. See the leaflet on Cardiovascular disease for more information.
