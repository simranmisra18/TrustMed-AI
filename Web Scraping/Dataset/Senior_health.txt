What is dementia?
Dementia is a syndrome (group of symptoms) of long-term problems with brain functioning, such as thinking, remembering, and reasoning. There are different types of dementia.
Memory loss is the most well-known symptom of dementia, but dementia can affect many other brain functions as well.
Dementia can affect brain functions such as:
Memory.

Language.

Judgement.

Social behaviour.

Dementia isn't the only cause of memory problems. For example, it is normal for memory to deteriorate a little as we get older: this doesn't necessarily mean we are developing dementia. It is normal for memory not to work well when we are distracted or concentrating on too many things at the same time. That's why memory lapses are more common if we are stressed. Physical and mental illness can all temporarily affect memory too.
What are the types of dementia?
There are many different types of dementia. They have different causes, and the symptoms can differ between types of dementia.
The most common types of dementia are:
Alzheimer's disease
This is the most common cause of dementia in older people. The cause of Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood, but it is thought that abnormal proteins, called plaques and tangles, build up in the brain and stop it from working properly.
Vascular dementia
This is the second-most common cause of dementia in older people. Vascular dementia is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, which damages brain cells. This can happen for a variety of reasons. One type of vascular dementia, called subcortical vascular dementia, occurs due to damage to small blood vessels supplying the brain. Another type, multi-infarct dementia, occurs as a result of several different small strokes affecting different areas of the brain.
Mixed dementia
This is a combination of two or more types of dementia; for example, if someone has both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.
Lewy body dementia
This is a type of dementia caused by lumps of protein in the brain, called Lewy bodies. It can cause hallucinations, movement problems, and unpredictable changes in thinking and alertness that can fluctuate from day-to-day.
Frontotemporal dementia
This is a type of dementia that causes the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain to shrink and stop working. It often causes problems with behaviour and language.
Other types of dementia
There are many other types of dementia, such as:
Dementia due to Parkinson's disease.
Dementia due to Parkinson's disease.
Dementia due to Huntington's disease.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus.

What are the symptoms of dementia?
All types of dementia cause problems with functioning of the brain. The exact symptoms can differ for different types of dementia.
In general, dementia tends to cause the following symptoms:
Loss of mental ability
Memory problems are often the most noticeable sign of dementia. Forgetting recent events is common, like going to the store and not remembering what was needed or misplacing things.
People with dementia may remember their childhood or past events well until the condition becomes severe. As it worsens, they might struggle to recall recent events, feel like they’re living in the past, or not recognize their true age. They may forget simple facts (like the name of the Prime Minister), have trouble remembering names, or finding the right words, often repeating questions.
Language issues can also develop. For example, someone with dementia may have difficulty understanding what is said to them or understanding written information. Problems with attention and concentration can also occur. It is common for someone with dementia not to be able to settle to anything and this can make them appear restless.
New surroundings and new people may confuse a person with dementia: they can become easily disorientated. However, in familiar places, and with old routines, they may function well. This is why some people with mild dementia cope well in their own homes. Losing track of time is also a common problem in someone with dementia. For example, not knowing if it is morning or afternoon, or what day it is. A person with dementia may get lost easily.
People who develop dementia may find it difficult to grasp new ideas or learn new skills. For example, how to use a new household gadget. The ability to think, calculate and problem-solve can be affected as intellect begins to fail. Difficulties with planning and decision making can develop.
Changes in mood, behaviour and personality
At first, someone with dementia may appear to be easily irritated or moody. It is often family or friends who notice this. Some people with early dementia recognise that they are failing and become depressed. However, many people with dementia are not aware that they have it. They may remain cheerful. The distress is often felt more by relatives who may find it difficult to cope.
More challenging behaviour may develop in some people over time. For example, in some cases, a person with dementia may become quite disinhibited. This means that he or she may say or do things quite out of character. This is often difficult for families and friends to cope with. Some people with dementia can also become agitated or even aggressive and this may be directed towards their carers. They may become suspicious or fearful of others. In some people, delusions (abnormal beliefs) and hallucinations (a false perception of something that is not really there) can occur. Visual hallucinations can be a common problem in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).
Mood, behavioural and personality changes may mean that someone with dementia is not able to interact with others in a social situation and they can become quite withdrawn. Sleep is often affected and pacing and restless wandering can become a problem for some.
Problems carrying out day-to-day activities
Difficulty with self-care usually develops over time. For example, without help, some people with dementia may not pay much attention to personal hygiene. They may forget to wash or change their clothes. Remembering to take medication can become an issue. The person may also have difficulty keeping up their home. Shopping, cooking and eating may become difficult. This can lead to weight loss. Driving may be dangerous and not possible for someone with dementia.
Later-stage symptoms of dementia
As dementia progresses, it can cause more significant problems, such as:
Not recognising close family or friends.
Not recognising close family or friends.
Having difficulty swallowing food or drink.

What causes dementia?
In general, dementia is caused by things that damage brain cells and the connections between them.
The different types of dementia have different causes. For example, although we don't fully understand why it happens, Alzheimer's disease seems to be caused by the buildup of abnormal proteins in the brain.
You can find out more about the causes of dementia in the separate leaflet called Causes of memory loss and dementia.
How common is dementia?
The World Health Organization (WHO) tells us there are about 50 million people in the world with dementia, and nearly 10 million developing the condition each year. By 2050, it is expected that there will be 135.5 million people in the world with dementia (over 2 million in the UK). So if dementia is affecting you or your loved one, you are certainly not alone.
The likelihood of getting dementia increases with age. Having said that, more than half of people will never develop dementia even if they reach the age of 95.
Brain and nerves
Everybody forgets things from time to time. In general, the things that you tend to forget most easily are the things that you feel do not matter as much.
by Dr Doug McKechnie, MRCGP
Brain and nerves
Alzheimer's disease is a cause of dementia. There is no cure and it can cause a great deal of distress for those affected and their families. However, early diagnosis is important because there is a great deal of support as well as medication that can help.
by Dr Colin Tidy, MRCGP
What are the stages of dementia?
Typically, symptoms of dementia tend to develop slowly, often over several years. In the early stages of the disease, many people with mild dementia cope with just a small amount of support and care. As the disease progresses more care is usually needed.
In the later stages of dementia, speech may be lost and severe physical problems may develop, including problems with mobility, incontinence and general frailty. This can make people more susceptible to other health problems such as infections. Often, people with dementia die from another health problem such as a severe chest infection. So, the dementia isn't the cause of their death but has contributed to it.
Some people can live for many years after dementia has been diagnosed. However, the condition does shorten lifespan. On average, once diagnosed with dementia, people are:
In the mild early stage for one or two years.
In the mild early stage for one or two years.
In the moderate stage, needing help looking after themselves for another two or three years.
In the moderate stage, needing help looking after themselves for another two or three years.
In a severe stage by four to five years after diagnosis, being completely dependent on carers and more or less completely inactive.
In a severe stage by four to five years after diagnosis, being completely dependent on carers and more or less completely inactive.
The average survival after diagnosis is 3-9 years, but people can survive for up to 20 years after being diagnosed with dementia.
How is dementia diagnosed?
Dementia is difficult to diagnose in some people. In the beginning, symptoms are often put down to other causes. There may also be a degree of protection by friends, carers and relatives who help the person to look after themself and, by doing so, cover up the person's difficulties.
However, it is often not the person with the symptoms but rather their relatives, carers or friends who have concerns that the person may have dementia. They may be concerned about the person's memory or behaviour. However, people with a high intellect or a demanding job may notice themselves that their mental ability is starting to fail.
Visit your doctor
The first step if you are concerned that you may be developing dementia is to see your doctor. Or, if you are worried that someone close to you may have dementia, you should encourage them to consult their doctor. They may agree for you to see their doctor with them.
Your doctor may suggest some special tests to look at your memory and mental ability, to see whether dementia is likely or not. This does not take long and is usually a series of questions or other exercises that your doctor asks you to complete.
Your doctor may also suggest some routine tests to make sure that there are no other obvious causes for your symptoms. For example, blood tests to look for infection, vitamin deficiencies, an underactive thyroid gland, etc. If infection is suspected, they may suggest a urine test, a chest X-ray or other investigations. They may also ask questions to make sure that your symptoms are not due to, for example, depression, any medicines that you may be taking, or excess alcohol intake.
Referral to a specialist
Referral for the opinion of a specialist is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis of dementia. This is usually to one of the following:
A specialist memory clinic.
A specialist memory clinic.
A psychiatrist specialised in looking after older people.
A psychiatrist specialised in looking after older people.
A specialist in the care of elderly people.
A specialist in the care of elderly people.
A neurologist.
A neurologist.
The specialist may be able to determine the likely cause of dementia and decide if any specific treatment may be helpful (see below). To help with this, they may suggest further investigations such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain.
Other more sophisticated tests may be done if an unusual cause of dementia is suspected.
Usually referral is made to a specialist team as early as possible. This is partly so the person developing dementia and their carers can obtain advice about advance planning. In the earlier stages, people are better able to make decisions about how they wish to be cared for. They are also better able to decide who they want to manage their affairs once they become unable to do so themselves.
Special memory clinics give lots of information on dementia and how to manage it. Sometimes before dementia is established, there is an earlier phase called mild cognitive impairment. People with mild memory symptoms are often referred to the specialist clinics, so that they can have information early. This is in case their symptoms get worse and develop into dementia.
You can find out more about treatments and support available in the separate leaflet called Medication and treatment for dementia.
Dementia research
Research is underway to try to find ways of diagnosing dementia earlier and more easily, as well as to try to predict who may develop it. Researchers have been looking at proteins (biomarkers) in the blood or the fluid that bathes the brain (the cerebrospinal fluid) in people who have Alzheimer's disease or may go on to develop Alzheimer's disease. Further work is needed before any of this can be used to predict Alzheimer's disease.
Can dementia be treated?
Dementia cannot be cured, but some treatments can help to control the symptoms, depending on the type of dementia.
These include drug and non-drug treatments.
For example:
Cognitive stimulation therapy can help the memory and thinking skills of people with mild or moderate dementia.

New treatments are under research.
Recently, drugs such as aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab have been developed, which aim to tackle the causes of Alzheimer's disease rather than just manage the symptoms. These might slow down the rate at which Alzheimer's disease progresses.
However, these drugs are expensive, and there is some uncertainty as to how well they actually work. At present, they are not available on the NHS.
Can dementia be prevented?
Some things do show some promise.
Having risk factors for cardiovascular disease can increase your risk of developing all types of dementia. These risk factors include:
Smoking.
Smoking.
Raised cholesterol levels.
Raised cholesterol levels.
Drinking too much alcohol.
Drinking too much alcohol.
Not doing enough physical activity.
Not doing enough physical activity.
Being overweight.
Being overweight.
Having diabetes or high blood pressure.
Having diabetes or high blood pressure.
Therefore, it would seem likely that doing something to modify these risk factors may reduce your risk of developing dementia. Stopping smoking, reducing excessive alcohol, and losing weight if you are overweight, for example, may all help to reduce your risk of dementia. Regular physical exercise is advised for all sorts of health benefits, including reducing the risk of dementia. One UK study suggested that a fifth of cases of Alzheimer's disease might have been related to lack of physical activity. It proposed that regular exercise might have actually prevented some of these cases.
Keeping your brain active may also help to reduce your risk of developing dementia. So, for example, consider reading books, doing puzzles, learning a foreign language, playing a musical instrument, taking up a new hobby, etc.
Many studies are going on to look into treatments which may help to prevent dementia. These include certain blood pressure medicines, omega-3 fatty acids, and brain training exercises, as well as the strategies discussed above. However, there is not yet convincing evidence available for any of these.
Further research is ongoing to try to find other ways of preventing dementia.
Living with dementia
Can I keep driving if I have been diagnosed with dementia?
If you have been diagnosed with dementia in the UK, you must notify the DVLA.
Whether or not someone with dementia can drive depends on the severity of their symptoms. Usually in the early stages of dementia it is safe to drive. In later stages it is likely that the ability to drive safely will be impaired.
You may be able to continue driving a car or a motorcycle safely for some time, but you may be asked to have a driving test and/or your doctor may be asked to complete a medical report for the DVLA. Driving will then be subject to a medical assessment and will be reviewed each year.
Someone who has been diagnosed with dementia will not be able to continue to drive a bus (or other vehicle that carries passengers) or a lorry or large goods vehicle.
Sometimes a person with dementia does not have insight into their driving and does not want to notify the DVLA. Friends and relatives can also report their concerns to the DVLA, if so.
What is the life expectancy of someone with dementia?
Life expectancy varies a lot depending on the type of dementia, the age of the person with dementia, the presence of any other medical conditions they have, and also where in the course of the illness the dementia diagnosis was made.
In general, though, dementia does reduce life expectancy compared to people without dementia.
The following is a general guide, based on averages. Some people live for longer. The average life expectancy after diagnosis is:
Alzheimer's disease - around 6 years.
Alzheimer's disease - around 6 years.
Vascular dementia - around 4 years. (This is lower than the averages for Alzheimer's disease, because people with vascular dementia are more likely to have other medical conditions that may shorten their lifespan.)

Arthritis means inflammation in a joint (like your knee, hip, elbow or fingers). It is a common problem and generally affects older people, although there are some rare conditions that cause arthritis in children and teenagers. There are lots of types of arthritis. Some give you short-term aches in the joints and then resolve completely, others can cause long-term problems and permanently affect how your joints move.
This leaflet will explain a bit about how joints work and then go through the main causes of arthritis in easy-to-read language.

What is arthritis?
Arthritis means inflammation of joints. Arthritis is very common. There are many causes of arthritis. Children and adults of all ages can be affected by arthritis, although the most common type is osteoarthritis and that affects older people. It is also more common in women than it is in men. See the separate leaflet called Osteoarthritis for more details.
Arthritis may affect just one joint, a few joints or many joints. Each cause of arthritis tends to have a typical pattern in terms of which joints are affected and the age of people most likely to be affected.
Understanding joints
Normal joint
A joint is situated where two bones meet. Joints allow movement and flexibility of various parts of the body. The movement of the bones is caused by muscles which pull on tendons that are attached to bone. Cartilage covers the end of bones. Between the cartilage of two bones that form a joint there is a small amount of thick fluid called synovial fluid. This lubricates the joint, which allows smooth movement between the bones.
The synovium is the connective tissue that surrounds a joint. Synovial fluid is made by cells of the synovium. The outer part of the synovium is called the capsule. This is tough, gives the joint stability, and stops the bones from moving out of joint. Surrounding ligaments and muscles also help to give support and stability to joints.
Bones, joints and muscles
Septic arthritis is an infection in a joint. Symptoms include pain and tenderness over a joint, pain on moving the joint, and feeling unwell. It is an uncommon infection but serious. Urgent treatment is needed. This includes antibiotic medicines and drainage of infected fluid from the joint to prevent permanent joint damage.
by Dr Hayley Willacy, FRCGP
What causes arthritis?
The two most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, there are many different causes of arthritis.
The following list includes some of the common conditions that mainly affect joints. For further information, each condition has a separate leaflet.
Rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) causes inflammation, pain, and swelling of joints. Persistent inflammation over time can damage affected joints. The severity can vary from mild to severe. The earlier treatment is started, the less joint damage is likely to occur.
Osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis (OA) causes pain and stiffness in joints. Symptoms may be helped by exercises, some physical devices and treatments, and losing weight if you are overweight. It can be caused or worsened by trauma, in which case it may be known as post-traumatic arthritis.
Septic arthritis
Septic arthritis is an infection in a joint. Symptoms of this arthritis include pain and tenderness over a joint, pain on moving the joint, and feeling unwell. It is an uncommon infection but very serious. Emergency treatment in hospital is needed.
Ankylosing spondylitis
Ankylosing spondylitis is a form of arthritis. It mainly affects the lower back. Other joints and other parts of the body are sometimes affected. Treatment includes regular exercise and anti-inflammatory medicines. The severity of ankylosing spondylitis varies from mild to severe. An eye complication called uveitis can be serious but can be treated successfully if treatment is given promptly.
Gout
Gout causes attacks of pain and swelling when uric acid in the body crystalises in one or more joints. An anti-inflammatory painkiller usually eases an attack quickly. Lifestyle factors may reduce the risk of having gout attacks. These include losing weight (if overweight), eating a healthy diet, and not drinking much alcohol or sugar-sweetened soft drinks.
Calcium pyrophosphate deposition
Calcium pyrophosphate is a substance produced in the cartilages of the joints. It can become deposited as crystals on joint tissues. This is called calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD). CPPD can cause a number of problems of which the most well known is pseudogout. This is almost identical to gout, causing attacks of pain and swelling in one or more joints. Some people get damage to the joint, causing a type of long-term arthritis. CPPD may cause no symptoms and is sometimes picked up on an X-ray done for an unrelated condition. Unlike gout, there is no special therapy for pseudogout.
Psoriatic arthritis
Psoriatic arthritis causes inflammation, pain, and swelling of joints in some people who have psoriasis (a skin condition). Other parts of the body may also be affected. For example, inflammation may also affect tendons and ligaments. The severity can vary from mild to severe. In some cases, affected joints become damaged which can cause disability.
Reactive arthritis
Reactive arthritis means that you develop inflammation in joints after you have had an infection in some other part of the body. Other symptoms usually develop in addition to the arthritis. Symptoms commonly last 3-6 months. In some cases the arthritis persists long-term. There is a rare 'triad' syndrome where arthritis, urethritis and conjunctivitis occur at the same time.
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an unusual condition in which joint inflammation occurs in children under the age of 16 years. It lasts for at least six weeks. Arthritis causes inflammation, pain and swelling of the affected joints. The severity can vary from mild to severe. The earlier the treatment is started, the less joint damage is likely to occur.
Conditions similar to arthritis
There are some medical problems which don't affect the joints predominantly, but can cause joint problems as they progress. Examples include:
Systemic lupus erythematosus
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can cause various symptoms, the most common being joint pain and stiffness, skin rashes and tiredness. Problems with kidneys and other organs can occur in severe cases.
Gut (bowel) conditions
Some gut conditions, especially inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, may cause arthritis.
Cervical spondylosis
Cervical spondylosis is a 'wear and tear' of the bones (vertebrae) and discs in the neck. It is a normal part of ageing and does not cause symptoms in many people. However, it is sometimes a cause of neck pain. Symptoms tend to come and go. In severe cases, the degeneration may cause irritation or pressure on the spinal nerve roots or spinal cord. This can cause arm or leg symptoms.
Polymyalgia rheumatica
Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) causes pain, stiffness and tenderness in large muscles, typically around the shoulders, upper arms and hips. The cause is not known. Some people with PMR develop a related condition called giant cell arteritis (GCA) which can be more serious and may threaten sight.
Fibromyalgia
Fibromyalgia causes pains and tenderness in many areas of the body, and tiredness. You may also have other symptoms.
Arthritis symptoms
The symptoms of arthritis vary depending on the type of arthritis and severity of the underlying cause. The symptoms include:
Joint pain, tenderness and stiffness.
Joint pain, tenderness and stiffness.
Restricted movement of the joints.

Warmth and red skin over the affected joint.

How is arthritis diagnosed?
As with all medical conditions, the diagnosis is made by a combination of a history, examination and investigations. Some patients will need to be referred to a specialist. For inflammatory arthritis (eg, rheumatoid and psoriatic), all patients will be seen by a rheumatologist (joint specialist). For a non-inflammatory arthritis such as osteoarthritis, management is usually fully in primary care, by a GP and sometimes other healthcare professionals such as a physiotherapist, with referral being reserved for those who may need surgery.
Arthritis treatment
Although there is no cure for arthritis, there are treatments available for all forms. However, the treatment will depend on the cause of arthritis.
Treatments may include:
Medicines (such as NSAIDs, used by mouth or topically).

Surgery.
Surgery.
Some causes of arthritis only need treatment for a short time. Other causes of arthritis may need lifelong treatment. If it affects the hip or the knee, treatment for osteoarthritis includes surgery to replace the entire joint. See the separate leaflets called Knee Replacement and Hip Replacement.
For elbow arthritis there is a technique known as elbow joint resurfacing, but this is not currently recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as there is not enough evidence for its safety and effectiveness. Some patients may be offered this procedure as part of a trial.
What is the outlook (prognosis) for arthritis?
Some types of arthritis are short-lived and don't leave you with any problems.
Examples are reactive arthritis, which usually goes away by itself and juvenile arthritis which may sometimes clear up without any long-term problems. Other types come and go, like gout.
Rheumatoid arthritis tends to stay with you for the long term, but can be controlled with medication.
Osteoarthritis can usually be controlled with a combination of painkillers, physiotherapy, and surgery, and by reducing pressure on the joint by avoiding being overweight.4

Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of sight impairment in those aged over 50. It causes a gradual loss of central vision, which is needed for detailed work and for things like reading and driving. Edge vision (peripheral vision) is not lost.

What is macular degeneration?
Macular degeneration (also known as age-related macular degeneration) occurs when cells in the macula - the central area of the retina - degenerate. The retina is a light sensitive layer that lines the interior of the eye. It is composed of light sensitive cells known as rods and cones. See Anatomy of the Eye for further information.
Damage to the macula affects central vision which is needed for reading, writing, driving, recognising people's faces and doing other fine tasks. The damage occurs at the level of the layer of cells within the retina called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).
The rest of the retina is used for peripheral vision - the 'side' vision which is not focused. Therefore, without a macula, it is still possible to get about, be aware of objects and people and be independent. However, the loss of central vision will severely affect normal vision.
Visual loss in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) can occur within months, or over many years, depending on the type and severity. There are two main types of AMD - 'wet' and 'dry'. 'Wet' AMD is the more severe but is more treatable.
Symptoms of macular degeneration
Early symptoms
The main early symptoms are:
Worsening of central vision despite using usual glasses.

AMD is painless. Symptoms of dry AMD tend to take 5-10 years to become severe. However, severe visual loss due to wet AMD can develop more quickly.
If AMD develops in one eye only, a person may not be aware of it until it's quite advanced, as the other eye will still see things normally. When both eyes are affected, symptoms become much more obvious.
Later symptoms
As the condition worsens, a 'blind spot' then develops in the middle of the visual field. This is not always initially noticeable. However, it tends to become larger over time as more and more rods and cones degenerate in the macula.
One early symptom of wet AMD is visual distortion. Typically, straight lines appear wavy or crooked. For example, the lines on a piece of graph paper, or the lines between tiles in a bathroom.
Visual hallucinations (also called Charles Bonnet syndrome) can occur with severe AMD. People see different images, from simple patterns to more detailed pictures - often they see complicated images of children or animals.
The experience can be upsetting but it does not mean you are developing a serious mental illness. If visual hallucinations do occur, they typically improve by 18 months.
Peripheral vision is not affected with AMD and so it does not cause total loss of vision.
Always see a doctor or optometrist promptly if you develop visual loss or visual distortion.
Older people should in any case have regular eye checks to check each eye separately for early AMD (and to check for other eye conditions such as glaucoma).
How common is macular degeneration?
Age-related macular degeneration only develops in older people (there are other rare types of macular degeneration which occur in younger people). AMD is the most common cause of severe sight problems (visual impairment) in the developed world. It is more common with increasing age.
It is rare under the age of 60. It usually begins in one eye. About 5 in 100 people aged over 65 and about 12 in 100 people aged over 80 have AMD severe enough to cause serious visual impairment. Women are more likely than men to develop AMD.
White people are more likely to develop AMD than those of African or Asian ethnicity. It is also more common in those who smoke, those who are overweight and those with cardiovascular disease.
Dry macular degeneration
This is the most common form of macular degeneration and occurs in 9 in 10 cases. In this type the cells in the RPE of the macula gradually become thin (they 'atrophy') and degenerate. This layer of cells is crucial for the function of the rods and cones which then also degenerate and die.
Wet macular degeneration
Wet AMD may also be called neovascular or exudative AMD. It occurs in about 1 in 10 cases. In wet AMD, in addition to the retinal pigment cells degenerating, fragile new blood vessels grow from the tiny blood vessels in the choroid into the macular part of the retina.
These vessels tend to leak blood and fluid. This can damage the rods and cones and cause scarring in the macula, causing further vision loss.
If a person has wet AMD (see below) in one eye the risk of developing wet AMD in the second eye is about 1 in 4.
Various systems exist to classify AMD. Both wet and dry AMD can be classified as early, intermediate or advanced, according to the degree of damage to the macula.
6 of every 10 cases of intermediate/advanced AMD are due to wet AMD. Wet and dry AMD are sometimes classified as early or late, and wet AMD as active or inactive.
Causes of macular degeneration
In people with AMD the cells of the RPE stop working work so well with advancing age. They gradually fail to take enough nutrients to the rods and cones and do not clear waste materials and byproducts.
As a result, tiny abnormal deposits called drusen develop under the retina. In time, the retinal pigment cells and their nearby rods and cones degenerate, stop working and die. This is the dry type of AMD.
In wet AMD, new blood vessels grow into the layers of the retina from the choroid. The reason why this happens in some cases of AMD is not known, although waste products or shortage of oxygen may be involved.
Risk factors
Certain risk factors increase the risk of developing AMD. These include:
Smoking tobacco.

Diagnosing macular degeneration
If symptoms suggestive of AMD develop, a doctor or optician (optometrist) will refer to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist). This should be done urgently, in case the diagnosis is wet AMD (which can worsen rapidly but which can be treated).
Diagnosing macular degeneration usually involves the following:
Eye examination
The Amsler grid is a tool that opticians and ophthalmologists use to detect vision problems resulting from damage to the macula (the central part of the retina) or the nerve that transmits what you can see to the brain (optic nerve). When looking at a special piece of paper with horizontal and vertical lines, if there is any section of the lines missing or distorted then AMD is a possible cause of the visual problem.
The ophthalmologist will examine the back of the eye with a slit-lamp microscope. Digital photographs can be taken of the retinae. The ophthalmologist will look for the typical changes that occur with dry AMD and wet AMD.
Ocular coherence tomography
Another test called ocular coherence tomography is becoming more commonly used. This is a non-invasive test that uses special light rays to scan the retina. It can give very detailed information about the macula and can show if it is abnormal. This test is useful when there is doubt about whether AMD is the wet or dry form, and to monitor treatment.
Fluorescein angiography
If wet AMD is diagnosed or suspected then a further test called fluorescein angiography may be done. For this test a dye is injected into a vein in the arm. Then, by looking into the eyes with a magnifier the ophthalmologist can see where any dye leaks into the macula from the abnormal leaky blood vessels. This can give an indication of the severity of the condition.
Macular degeneration treatment
Treatment for dry AMD
For the more common dry AMD, there is no specific treatment yet. Remember that in this type of AMD the visual loss tends to be gradual, over 5-10 years or so, and peripheral vision will not be lost. Intraocular lens systems (see below) are a recent development which may eventually offer hope for advanced AMD.
Treatment for wet AMD
For the less common wet AMD, a treatment called anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) may halt or delay the progression of visual loss.
VEGF is a chemical that is involved in the formation of new blood vessels in the macula in people with wet AMD. By blocking the action of this chemical, it helps prevent the condition from progressing and may partially reverse it.
Anti-VEGF medicines include:
Ranibizumab.
Ranibizumab.
Pegaptanib.
Pegaptanib.
Aflibercept.
Aflibercept.
Faricimab.
Faricimab.
Another medicine called bevacizumab is not licensed for treating AMD but is cheaper and appears equally effective.
The anti-VEGF medicines are injected using a fine needle directly into the globe of the eye. Injections are generally needed every four weeks for up to two years. Very specific criteria have been set out by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to determine which patients are eligible for treatment.
Anti-VEGF injections will improve vision in about one in three people treated. However, treatment in most people will maintain vision and prevent the condition from becoming worse. About one person in every ten treated, will not respond at all.
Intraocular lens systems
This approach may eventually benefit patients with end-stage AMD of either type.
A series of lenses (or a miniature telescope) is used to deflect the central visual image away from the diseased macula and on to a functional part of the retina. The lenses focus and enlarge the central image in this new undamaged area.
The brain appears able to adapt to using the healthy part of the retina to view central images. Patients usually require visual rehabilitation.
In studies so far, more than two thirds of patients have significant improvement in their vision. However, the complications can be serious, including:
Raised pressure in the eyes.
Raised pressure in the eyes.
Fogging of the new lenses or the cornea.
Fogging of the new lenses or the cornea.
Damage to the eye itself.
Damage to the eye itself.
NICE recommends that implanting a miniature lens system implantation can improve both vision and quality of life in the short term. However, there is insufficient evidence for short-term safety or for long-term benefit and safety. Therefore, NICE recommends that the procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research.
Older treatments
Older treatments for wet AMD are less effective than anti-VEGF injections. These included laser treatment (which is difficult close to the macula, as it causes scarring and loss of vision) and photodynamic therapy.
In photodynamic therapy, a medicine called verteporfin is injected into a vein and binds to the newly formed abnormal blood vessels in the macula, allowing them to be targeted with a type of laser. It did not work in all cases, although the success rate in preventing progression was good; however, it did not restore vision.
Low vision rehabilitation and low vision services are offered by hospital eye departments and information can be found from the Macular Society and the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB).
Does diet matter inmacular degeneration?
Whether or not there is a treatment that can prevent progression, or even reverse your condition, it is important to maximise the sight you do have.
Certain groups of people with AMD can benefit from vitamin and mineral supplements. These supplements can slow down the progression of AMD. They are thought to be most beneficial in people with intermediate or advanced AMD.
A combination of high-dose vitamins and minerals called AREDS2 has been tested and found to be most effective. These include:
500 mg vitamin C.
500 mg vitamin C.
400 IU vitamin E.
400 IU vitamin E.
10 mg lutein.
10 mg lutein.
2 mg zeaxanthin.
2 mg zeaxanthin.
25 mg zinc.
25 mg zinc.
2 mg copper.
2 mg copper.
High doses of vitamins and minerals can lead to side-effects in some people. Vitamin E has been linked with an increased risk of heart failure in people with diabetes or blood vessel (vascular) disease. Zinc may increase the risk of developing bladder and kidney problems.
Because of these potential problems, these supplements should not be started before getting advice from a GP or a consultant eye specialist (ophthalmologist).
Practical help for macular degeneration
When vision becomes poor, it is common to be referred (by your ophthalmologist) to a low vision clinic. Staff at the clinic provide practical help and advice on how to cope with poor and/or deteriorating vision.
Help may include magnifying lenses, large-print books, and bright lamps which may assist reading. Non-optical gadgets such as talking watches and kitchen aids can help when vision is limited.
Being registered as visually impaired or severely visually impaired may be helpful. An ophthalmologist can complete a 'Certificate of Visual Impairment', and a person may then be entitled to certain benefits.
What else can I do?
For smokers, try to stop. Smoking is a risk factor for many illnesses, including AMD. The NHS can provide help, support and medicines to assist stopping smoking.

Regular sight tests. An eye test can often pick up the first signs of an eye condition before any change in vision occurs. An optician (optometrist) can advise how often an eye check-up is needed, depending on general health, age, family history and other medical conditions. Early detection of problems often allows more effective treatment.

Studies suggest that varicose veins occur in 10-20 out of 100 men and 25-33 out of 100 women. Most people with varicose veins do not have an underlying disease. They often occur for no apparent reason, although they are associated with lifestyle factors in some cases.
Varicose veins do not cause symptoms or complications in most cases, although some people find them unsightly. If treatment is advised, or wanted for cosmetic reasons, a procedure to seal them off is used. There are several procedures available: heat, lasers or chemicals injected into the veins. These methods have largely replaced the old-fashioned surgical methods such as stripping the veins out.

What are varicose veins?
Varicose veins are enlarged (dilated) sections of veins which are located just under the surface of the skin - usually on the leg. They are often easy to see, as they look thick and knobbly. They may be less obvious if you are overweight, as they are hidden by fatty tissue under the skin.

Varicose veins will affect nearly one third of us at some point in our lives. For those who do develop these visible and protruding leg veins, another third will experience symptoms of depression. Unfortunately, we can't prevent varicose veins from developing, but by following five healthy lifestyle habits we can slow down their progression and minimise discomfort.

Heart health and blood vessels
Venous leg ulcers are common in older people. The most important part of treatment is for compression bandages to be applied correctly by a nurse. Keep as active as possible but elevate your leg when you are resting. Other treatments may be advised in some cases, such as a skin graft or vein surgery. After an ulcer has healed you should wear a support stocking each day, which helps to prevent it recurring.

What causes varicose veins?
Varicose vein
It is thought that the wall of the vein becomes weak in some sections. These sections then widen and become more prominent.
If this occurs near a valve then the valve may become leaky and blood may flow backwards. Once this happens at one valve there is increased pressure on the vein. This can cause more widening and more leaky valves. Blood then pools (collects) in the enlarged vein and makes it stand out.
About 10-20 out of 100 men and 25-33 out of 100 women develop varicose veins at some time in their lives. More women than men develop varicose veins. Most people with varicose veins do not have an underlying disease and they occur for no apparent reason. However, the chance of them developing is increased with:
Pregnancy. This is partly due to the baby causing extra pressure on the veins and partly because hormones you make during pregnancy tend to relax vein walls. The more babies you have, the more the risk of permanent varicose veins developing. Varicose veins tend to appear, or become worse, during pregnancy but often improve after childbirth when the pressure on the veins eases.

What are the symptoms of varicose veins?
Most people with varicose veins have no symptoms. Some people are concerned about the appearance of the veins. Larger varicose veins can ache, feel heavy or itch.
Are varicose veins dangerous?
Most people with varicose veins do not develop complications. Complications develop in a small number of cases. Complications are due to the higher pressure in the varicose veins causing changes to the small blood vessels in nearby skin.
Possible complications include:
Inflammation of the vein (thrombophlebitis).

Varicose vein treatment
Most people with varicose veins do not need any treatment. You may want to have treatment for one of the following reasons:
If complications develop - these occur in a small number of cases. If leg swelling or skin changes develop over prominent veins, treatment is usually advised to prevent a skin ulcer from developing. If a skin ulcer does occur then treatment of any varicose veins may help to cure the ulcer. If you have a varicose vein which has bled, you should be referred urgently for treatment.

Tests for varicose veins
If varicose veins are problematic, you will usually be referred for assessment by a doctor who is a specialist. You may have a type of ultrasound scan called a Doppler or a duplex scan. This helps to show how the blood is flowing in the veins. It can show whether any of the valves are damaged - which is useful to know when planning treatment. Occasionally, other tests are needed if the veins are complex.
If you have arterial disease (poor circulation, or peripheral arterial disease) in your legs, or if arterial disease is suspected, the arterial circulation needs to be measured. This needs to be done before you have treatment which puts pressure on the leg, such as compression stockings (below).
The arterial circulation is normally measured by using an ultrasound machine called a Doppler ultrasound, which is used to give a measurement called the ankle brachial pressure index. This test can be done in specialised clinics and also by some nurses and GPs.
How to get rid of varicose veins
There are several different options. Traditional operations such as vein stripping have largely been replaced by procedures which involve heat, lasers or the injection of chemicals into the vein.
Self-help methods
Avoid prolonged standing or sitting still. Try to put your feet up frequently (sit or lie down and raise the feet above the level of your hips). You can, for example, use extra pillows under your feet on a bed or footrest). This helps to reduce blood pooling in the veins. Use a moisturising cream or ointment to protect the skin in the affected area if it is dry, flaky or itchy.
Varicose vein treatment techniques have been developed which have a lower rate of complications, such as bruising, compared with traditional surgery. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that they be used in preference to traditional surgery for people who are having their veins treated for the first time. They include:
Radiofrequency ablation and endovenous laser ablation. These methods involve passing a probe into one of the longer varicose veins, using ultrasound to guide the position. The laser or radiofrequency energy makes the vein heat up, which seals it.

Foam sclerotherapy. This technique is used if heat or lasers do not work. It uses a chemical mixed with air to make foam. The foam is injected into the veins, pushing the blood away and making the veins go into spasm. After treatment, compression stockings are needed,and the veins will be hard and swollen for a while before they shrink down. More than one treatment may be needed

Surgery
Traditional surgery is recommended if treatment with heat, lasers or foam does not work. Different techniques can be used to remove the veins, depending on their site and severity.
Sclerotherapy
The vein is injected with a chemical that can close and seal (sclerose) it. It was once used as a main treatment but it became clear that it commonly causes skin staining and ulcers. It is now mainly reserved for small veins below the knee which have not been treated properly or have come back after surgery. The vein needs to be compressed afterwards, which involves wearing bandaging or compression stockings for a few days or weeks.
Support tights and compression stockings
These counter the extra pressure in the veins. They may help to ease symptoms such as ache, although there is little proof as to how well they work. They may be difficult to put on, particularly by people who have arthritis in their hands. Current guidelines do not recommend that they be used routinely unless treatments to seal the veins are not suitable or do not work.
If you do need compression stockings, below-knee class 1 (light) or class 2 (medium) are usually the most suitable. Ideally, they should be put on first thing in the morning, before you get out of bed, then taken off when going to bed at night. Compression stockings are available on prescription or you can buy them.
Note: if you have arterial disease in the legs, you will need a medical assessment of your circulation to decide if compression stockings are suitable (see above).
How to prevent varicose veins
There's little evidence for any particular ways of preventing varicose veins. However, there are ways to ease the symptoms of varicose veins, such as:
Avoid standing or sitting still for long periods.
