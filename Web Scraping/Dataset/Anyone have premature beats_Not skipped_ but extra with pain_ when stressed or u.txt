I get them, more and more now
However there are days when I don’t get 1
Today I had 5
I guess if you have less than 10% of the overall heart beats as ectopics or PVCS, then that’s benign
I know people who have 10,000/20,000 a day and they are still okay
Mine get painful(at the extra beat) when I’m especially underslept or stressed
When I’m calm and don’t think about them, they go away
It’s also possibly a vagul thing, When I work hard, don’t eat for long periods, not even a healthy meal, acid builds up and that irritates the vagus nerve, and there it goes firing off off sync/off rhythm extra beats with sharp pain
Anyone else get this sensation?

i definitely get pain with my pvcs but I can’t pinpoint why. It doesn’t happen all the time and I think the pain does occur more when I’m stressed. the heart pain I feel is extremely left sided and under the left breast. I know it’s heart pain because I felt the same pain when coming off propranolol and it coincides with the pvcs/
