There are two main types of diabetes - type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 usually first develops in children or in young adults. Type 2 usually first develops in people over the age of 40 years and is often (though not always) associated with being overweight. However, type 2 diabetes is increasingly being diagnosed in children and in young adults.

Understanding glucose and insulin
Both types of diabetes can cause serious complications. With regular monitoring and good control of the raised blood sugars these can be significantly reduced. In addition to the treatment from healthcare professionals, it is very important for people with diabetes to understand their condition and be able to manage their diabetes.
Types of diabetes
What is diabetes?
Diabetes mellitus (just called diabetes from now on) occurs when the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood is higher than normal. There are two main types of diabetes - type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. See the separate leaflet called What's the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes?
This leaflet refers to diabetes mellitus (now usually just known as diabetes); there is a separate condition called diabetes insipidus which is always called by its full name.
Type 1 diabetes
Around 10% of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition. It is not caused by someone's diet or lifestyle. It usually develops quite quickly, over days or weeks, as the pancreas stops making insulin. It usually (but not always) develops in childhood. See the separate leaflet called Type 1 diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes
Around 90% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is more common in people who are overweight or obese. It tends to develop gradually (over months or years) because the changes in the body develop quite slowly. Type 2 diabetes can be caused by the pancreas not producing enough insulin, or the body not responding properly to the insulin that is produced - and often both.
Type 2 diabetes usually starts in middle-aged or older adults but is increasingly being seen in children and in young adults. See the separate leaflet called Type 2 diabetes.
Gestational diabetes
As well as type 1 and type 2 diabetes, there are other types of diabetes. Pregnant women who have never had diabetes before but who have high blood glucose levels during pregnancy have gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after birth, but women who have had gestational diabetes are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes in future. Gestational diabetes affects about 4% of all pregnant women. See the separate leaflet called Diabetes and pregnancy.
Diabetes
Getting enough sleep is vital for your overall wellbeing - you need around 7 to 9 hours a night to support your mental and physical health. If you have diabetes, it's especially important to get enough sleep, as it can play a key role in managing your condition. In this article, we explore why sleep matters and how to incorporate healthy sleep habits into your daily routine.

Diabetes
Diabetic kidney disease is a complication that occurs in some people with diabetes. It can progress to kidney failure in some cases. Treatment aims to prevent or delay the progression of the disease. Also, it aims to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke which are much more common than average in people with this disease. To find out more about the kidneys and urine, see the leaflet called What do kidneys do?

Other types of diabetes
There are also a number of rarer forms of diabetes, including:
Secondary diabetes: diabetes can be caused by other diseases. Examples include diseases that affect the pancreas such as cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis. Diabetes can also be caused by other hormone (endocrine) diseases, such as Cushing's syndrome and acromegaly.

Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA): a slow-onset form of type 1 diabetes that occurs in adults, often with a slower onset than the usual type 1 diabetes that starts in childhood. LADA is sometimes called 'type 1.5 diabetes', because it has similarities to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is sometimes thought of as an 'in-between' condition.

What causes diabetes?
Diabetes is a condition where there is not enough insulin being produced by the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that the body needs in order to move glucose into cells to be used for energy. Insulin also helps the liver to store blood sugar to be used later. So, if insulin levels are too low, blood sugar (glucose) levels increase.
Type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes have different causes.
Causes of type 1 diabetes
Type 1 diabetes is thought to be an auto-immune condition where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas which produce insulin. There is a genetic component to type 1 diabetes (it is more common in children who have a relative with type 1 diabetes) but there is probably an environmental factor too - in some people, an event probably "triggers" the start of the diabetes. For example there was a significant increase in diagnoses of type 1 diabetes after COVID infections, even where the child had very few symptoms from COVID.
Type 1 diabetes is not caused by any type of diet or lifestyle. We don't yet know of any way to prevent type 1 diabetes from developing.
Causes of type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes can be caused by insulin not working properly (insulin resistance), or by the pancreas not producing enough insulin. Often, insulin resistance develops first, so the pancreas has to produce more and more insulin, and eventually struggles to be able to produce enough insulin for the body's needs.
Type 2 diabetes has a number of possible causes, including:
Being overweight or having obesity. This is the most common cause of type 2 diabetes.
Having excess fat stored internally around the liver and pancreas is also linked to developing type 2 diabetes, and can happen in people who are a healthy weight.

Diet. Type 2 diabetes is not directly caused by eating certain foods, but a diet with lots of high-calorie foods can lead to overweight and obesity, which can then lead to type 2 diabetes. A diet that is high in the following foods increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes:
High-sugar food and drinks, especially drinks containing added sugar, such as fizzy drinks or soda.
Red meat and processed meat.
Refined carbohydrates, such as white rice and white bread.
Ultra-processed foods.

What are the symptoms of diabetes?
The first symptoms of diabetes may include:
Being very thirsty a lot of the time.

Tiredness, weight loss and feeling generally unwell.
In people with type 1 diabetes, the symptoms tend to develop quickly, over a few days or weeks. Untreated type 1 diabetes causes people to become very unwell. Some people, especially children, with type 1 diabetes develop the disease too quickly to spot some of these symptoms.
Once diabetes treatment is started, symptoms of diabetes should go away. However, the symptoms may come back if blood glucose levels become high again.
Type 2 diabetes symptoms
Type 2 diabetes develops much more slowly than type 1 diabetes. Symptoms may not start until someone has had type 2 diabetes for a number of years. Many people with type 2 diabetes do not have any symptoms at all. This means that people with type 2 diabetes may already have complications of diabetes (see below) when diabetes is first diagnosed. Even though the symptoms of type 2 diabetes are often less severe, the condition is still very important to manage well.
How is diabetes diagnosed?
There are several ways of diagnosing diabetes. These include:
A blood test to look at the level of glucose in the blood.
A blood test to look at the level of glucose in the blood.
A different blood test for glycosylated haemoglobin (haemoglobin A1c, or HbA1c). HbA1c measures the average level of blood sugar over the last 3 months.
This is very commonly used to diagnose and monitor type 2 diabetes.
It is not suitable for the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, but is used to monitor the control of type 1 diabetes.

How is diabetes treated?
Healthy lifestyle and diet
People with diabetes should follow a healthy lifestyle with a healthy diet, maintaining an ideal body weight, taking regular exercise and not smoking.
People with type 2 diabetes can sometimes be managed by lifestyle changes alone. By losing weight and following a low-carbohydrate diet (or, with close medical supervision, a very low-calorie diet), many people can bring their blood sugar back to normal without medication.
Insulin treatment
People with type 1 diabetes always need treatment with insulin, and cannot live without it. Insulin is life-saving for people with type 1 diabetes.
Insulin is sometimes used by people with type 2 diabetes, but usually only if other medications haven't worked. See the separate leaflet called Insulins.
Medicines for type 2 diabetes
Many people with type 2 diabetes take one or more medicines if a healthy lifestyle is not enough to control blood sugar (glucose) levels.
These include tablets and injections. See the separate leaflet called Type 2 diabetes treatment for more detail.
Monitoring blood pressure and cholesterol levels
Treating diabetes is not just about managing blood glucose levels (although this is important). It is also essential to reduce the risk of the complications of diabetes (see below). It is therefore important to keep blood pressure and cholesterol levels in the normal range. Read more in the separate leaflet called Diabetes and high blood pressure.
The treatment for diabetes includes regular monitoring to diagnose and treat complications at an early stage.
When people with diabetes are unwell for any reason, even just a simple viral infection, their blood glucose control can be affected. It is therefore very important to know what to do during an illness. Read about advice for people with diabetes when unwell, in the separate leaflet called Diabetes and Illness.
Aims of diabetes treatment
Diabetes cannot usually be cured but it can be treated successfully. If a high blood glucose level is brought down to a normal or near-normal level, symptoms will ease. For many people, type 2 diabetes can be reversed (and may be considered "cured") with weight loss and exercise but will come back if weight is gained.
Complications of diabetes are a risk even without any symptoms of diabetes. Studies have shown that people who have better glucose control have fewer complications (such as heart disease or eye problems) compared with those people who have poorer control of their glucose level.
Therefore, the main aims of treatment are:
To keep blood glucose level as near normal as possible.

Healthy diet and other lifestyle advice
It is important to eat a healthy diet. This diet is the same as that recommended for everyone. It is not the case that particular special foods are needed for people with diabetes. 'Diabetic foods' still raise blood glucose levels, may contain just as much fat and calories and are usually more expensive than non-diabetic foods.
Other diet and lifestyle advice includes:
Eating a diet low in fat, salt and sugar and high in fibre, with plenty of fruit and vegetables.

It is best to try to lose weight if overweight or obese. Excess weight is also a risk factor for heart and blood vessel disease. Getting to a perfect weight may be difficult but losing some weight will always help.

There is no need to give up alcohol completely unless wanting to. Whether people have diabetes or not, healthy guidelines in the UK generally recommend a limit of 14 units a week for both men and women (government guidelines have recently been revised for men). See the separate leaflet called Alcohol and Sensible Drinking. However, drinking alcohol when you have diabetes can make an episode of hypoglycaemia (a 'hypo') more likely.
Immunisation
People with diabetes should be immunised against flu (each autumn), COVID (whenever this is offered) and immunised against infection from pneumococcal germs (bacteria). These infections can be particularly dangerous for people with diabetes.
Monitoring blood glucose levels
Anyone with diabetes who needs treatment with insulin should monitor their blood glucose levels. This is usually not necessary for people with type 2 diabetes who do not need insulin.
It is important to have regular checks as some complications, particularly if detected early, can be treated or prevented from becoming worse.
Doctors, nurses, dieticians, specialists in foot care (podiatrists), specialists in eye health (optometrists) and other healthcare workers all play a role in giving advice and checking on progress. As well as ongoing advice on diet and lifestyle, regular checks may include:
It is important to keep blood glucose, cholesterol and blood pressure levels as normal as possible. The HbA1c blood test helps to check blood glucose control. Ideally, the aim is to keep HbA1c less than 48 mmol/mol. However, this may not always be possible to achieve and the target level of HbA1c should be agreed with your doctor. For people with type 2 diabetes the aim is often to keep the HbA1c to less than 59 mmol/mol.
Eye checks - to detect problems with the back of the eye, the retina (a possible complication of diabetes) which can often be prevented from getting worse. Increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma) is also more common in people with diabetes and can usually be treated. Read more in the separate leaflet Diabetic retinopathy.

Complications of diabetes
Dehydration
If blood sugar (glucose) levels are not well controlled this may cause a lack of fluid in the body (dehydration), tiredness and drowsiness. This may progress to a serious illness which can be life-threatening, especially if you have type 1 diabetes.
Infections
A very high blood glucose level sometimes develops as a result of other illnesses such as any infections. People with diabetes who use insulin injections may need to adjust the dose of insulin to keep the blood glucose levels normal.
Ketoacidosis
For people with type 1 diabetes, high blood glucose levels can lead to acids called ketones in the bloodstream (this is called ketoacidosis). Less commonly, people with type 2 diabetes may develop a condition with very high blood glucose levels but no ketones (called hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic coma).
Either of these conditions can dangerously reduce the fluid in your body and both conditions need emergency treatment, as they can be fatal.
Hypoglycaemia
Too much insulin (or too high a dose of some of the diabetes tablets) can make the blood glucose level go too low (hypoglycaemia, sometimes called a 'hypo'). This can cause sweating, confusion or a feeling of being generally unwell; occasionally it can cause coma.
Emergency treatment of hypoglycaemia is with sugar, sweet drinks, or a glucagon injection (a hormone which has the opposite effect to insulin) followed by a starchy snack such as a sandwich. See the separate leaflet called Hypoglycaemia (Low blood sugar).
Other complications
Diabetes can cause other problems such as:
Infections may take longer to get better or be harder to treat, particularly if blood glucose levels are poorly controlled.
Infections may take longer to get better or be harder to treat, particularly if blood glucose levels are poorly controlled.
Psychological difficulties such as depression, anxiety and eating disorders.
Psychological difficulties such as depression, anxiety and eating disorders.
Routine surgical procedures (such as a joint replacement or hernia repair) will not usually be performed if diabetes control is poor. They will usually be delayed until the Hba1c is at least below 69 mmol/mol.
Long-term complications
If the blood glucose level is higher than normal, over a long period of time, it can have a damaging effect on the blood vessels.
Even a mildly raised glucose level which does not cause any symptoms in the short term can affect the blood vessels in the long term. This may lead to some of the following complications:
Furring or 'hardening' of the arteries (atheroma) which can cause problems such as angina, heart attacks, stroke and poor circulation.

Male sexual difficulties (such as erectile dysfunction) and female sexual difficulties (such as a dry vagina, yeast infections and loss of sensation) are common.
The type and severity of long-term complications vary from case to case. In general, the nearer the blood glucose level is to normal, the lower the risk of developing complications. The risk of developing complications is also reduced if other risk factors (such as high blood pressure) are managed fully.
Diabetes burnout
Caring for diabetes is extremely demanding. Diabetes burnout occurs when people feel overwhelmed by their diabetes. This can lead to feeling angry, frustrated, defeated and also worried about not taking care of diabetes well enough.
Burnout can respond well to talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). There is also good support from diabetes support groups.
Diabetes in pregnancy
Diabetes in pregnancy is associated with possible complications for the mother and baby. Women with diabetes who become pregnant need very close monitoring and specialist treatment to make sure that the mother and baby remain well with no problems. See the separate leaflet called Diabetes and pregnancy.
Some women develop diabetes in pregnancy, known as gestational diabetes. This usually resolves after the baby has been born. These women are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on and should have blood tests every year to monitor this.
Can diabetes be prevented?
There is currently no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes although many studies are looking into a number of different possibilities.
Type 2 diabetes can be prevented by following a healthy lifestyle, such as a healthy diet, regular exercise and not being overweight. This is very important for everyone. However, it is particularly important for people who are at increased risk, including those who have pre-diabetes (impaired glucose tolerance) or who have had gestational diabetes or who have a family history of type 2 diabetes.
What is the outlook for people with diabetes?
Although diabetes is associated with serious complications, these complications can be prevented or greatly reduced in severity. A healthy lifestyle, regular monitoring and taking medicines to keep the blood sugar (glucose), blood pressure and cholesterol levels as normal as possible are all very important.
Some people with type 2 diabetes are able to achieve 'diabetes in remission'. This means their blood glucose stays within normal levels without medication. The most successful way to achieve this is with lifestyle changes, including losing weight and either a medically supervised very low-calorie diet or a low-carbohydrate diet.
Understanding glucose and insulin
After eating, various foods are broken down in the gut (intestine) into sugars. The main sugar, glucose, passes through the gut wall into your bloodstream. . Other starchy carbohydrate foods such as potato, rice or breakfast cereals digest down into significant amounts of glucose too.
To remain healthy, your blood sugar (glucose) level should not go too high. So when blood glucose level begins to rise - particularly after eating - the level of a hormone called insulin should also rise.
Insulin works on the cells of the body and makes them take in glucose from the bloodstream, thus lowering the blood glucose again. Some of the glucose is used by the cells for energy. Any glucose not used up in this way is converted into glycogen in the liver or fat in the liver or abdomen.
When the blood glucose level begins to fall (between meals or when there is no food), the level of insulin falls. Some glycogen or fat is then converted back into glucose. This is released from the cells into the bloodstream to keep the blood glucose level normal.
Over time, if there is more glucose in the system than needed for energy, this can lead to central obesity (weight carried around the abdomen) and fatty liver.
Insulin is a hormone that is made by cells called beta cells. These are part of little islands of cells (islets) within the pancreas gland. Hormones are chemicals that are released by glands into the bloodstream and work on various parts of the body.
Diabetes develops if the pancreas is not making enough insulin or if the insulin that you is made does not work properly on the body's cells:
In type 1 diabetes, the body does not make any insulin at all.
In type 1 diabetes, the body does not make any insulin at all.
In type 2 diabetes, levels of insulin may be normal but the body doesn't respond properly to them. This is called insulin resistance. Over time, the body's ability to produce insulin also drops in type 2 diabetes and the blood sugar (glucose) levels therefore remain high.
In type 2 diabetes, levels of insulin may be normal but the body doesn't respond properly to them. This is called insulin resistance. Over time, the body's ability to produce insulin also drops in type 2 diabetes and the blood sugar (glucose) levels therefore remain high.

Insulin
Dealing with hyperglycaemia
Type 1 diabetes is the type of diabetes that typically develops in children and in young adults. In type 1 diabetes the body stops making insulin and the blood sugar (glucose) level goes very high. Treatment to control the blood glucose level is with insulin injections and a healthy diet. Other treatments aim to reduce the risk of complications. They include reducing blood pressure if it is high and advice to lead a healthy lifestyle.

What is type 1 diabetes?
What is type 1 diabetes?
Diabetes mellitus (just called diabetes from now on) occurs when the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood becomes higher than normal. There are two main types of diabetes. These are called type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes usually first develops in children or young adults. In the UK about 1 in 300 people develop type 1 diabetes at some stage.
With type 1 diabetes the illness usually develops quite quickly, over days or weeks, as the pancreas stops making insulin. It is treated with insulin injections and a healthy diet (see below).
Type 1 diabetes symptoms
The symptoms that usually occur when you first develop type 1 diabetes are:
You are very thirsty a lot of the time.

You pass a lot of urine.

Tiredness, weight loss and feeling generally unwell.
Tiredness, weight loss and feeling generally unwell.
How does type 1 diabetes affect your weight?
The above symptoms tend to develop quite quickly, over a few days or weeks. After treatment is started, the symptoms soon settle and go. However, without treatment, the blood sugar (glucose) level becomes very high and acids form in the bloodstream (ketoacidosis). If this persists you will become lacking in fluid in the body (dehydrated) and are likely to lapse into a coma and die. (The reason you make a lot of urine and become thirsty is because glucose leaks into your urine, which pulls out extra water through the kidneys.)
Diabetes
Teplizumab (Tzield) has been approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to help delay the onset of Stage 3 type 1 diabetes (T1D). Read on to see what this means if you are prescribed teplizumab and what it does for you.
by Lawrence Higgins
How is type 1 diabetes diagnosed?
How do you know if you have type 1 diabetes?
A simple dipstick test can detect sugar (glucose) in a sample of urine. This may suggest the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. However, the only way to confirm the diagnosis is to have a blood test to look at the level of glucose in your blood.
What causes type 1 diabetes?
Type 1 diabetes occurs when your blood glucose (sugar) level is too high because your pancreas can’t make insulin. This happens because some cells and chemicals in your blood attack and destroy the cells in your pancreas. It is not known exactly why the insulin producing cells in the pancreas are attacked, but it may be triggered by certain infections.
Is type 1 diabetes inherited?
Is type 1 diabetes hereditary?
Although type 1 diabetes is not an inherited disease, there is a genetic factor. A first-degree relative (sister, brother, son, daughter) of someone with type 1 diabetes has about a 1 in 16 chance of developing type 1 diabetes. This is higher than the chance of the general population, which is about 1 in 300. This is probably because certain people are more prone to developing autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, and this is due to their genetic make-up, which is inherited.
Why does the pancreas stop making insulin?
In most cases, type 1 diabetes is thought to be an autoimmune disease. The immune system normally makes antibodies to attack germs called bacteria and viruses, and also other germs. In autoimmune diseases the immune system makes antibodies against part or parts of the body.
If you have type 1 diabetes you make antibodies that attach to the beta cells in the pancreas. These are thought to destroy the cells that make insulin. It is thought that something triggers the immune system to make these antibodies. The trigger is not known but a popular theory is that a virus triggers the immune system to make these antibodies.
Rarely, type 1 diabetes is due to other causes. For example, severe inflammation of the pancreas, or surgical removal of the pancreas for various reasons.
Complications of type 1 diabetes
Very high blood glucose level
If you are not treated, or use too little insulin, a very high blood sugar (glucose) level can develop quite quickly - over several days. If left untreated this causes lack of fluid in the body (dehydration), drowsiness, and serious illness which can be life-threatening. A very high blood glucose level sometimes develops if you have other illnesses such as any infections. In these situations you may need to adjust the dose of insulin to keep your blood glucose level normal.
Long-term complications
If the blood glucose level is higher than normal, over a long period of time, it can have a damaging effect on the blood vessels. Even a mildly raised glucose level which does not cause any symptoms in the short term can affect the blood vessels in the long term. This may lead to some of the following complications (often years after diabetes is first diagnosed):
Furring or 'hardening' of the arteries (atheroma) which can cause problems such as angina, heart attacks, stroke and poor circulation.

The type and severity of long-term complications vary from case to case. You may not develop any at all. In general, the nearer your blood glucose level is to normal, the less your risk of developing complications. Your risk of developing complications is also reduced if you deal with any other risk factors that you may have, such as high blood pressure.
It has been found that people with type 1 diabetes are more at risk of periodontitis. This is a condition that destroys the tissues supporting your teeth. Untreated, this could lead to tooth loss. Gingivitis which is an inflammation of the gums can lead to periodontitis and further severe gum conditions if left untreated.
At your annual review, your doctor will remind you to have checks with your dentist. If you do have periodontitis, managing this illness can improve blood sugar control. Your dentist may see you more regularly to ensure this condition is managed properly to prevent complications.
Treatment of complications
Too much insulin can make the blood glucose level go too low (hypoglycaemia, sometimes called a 'hypo'). This can cause you to feel sweaty, confused and unwell; you may lapse into a coma. Emergency treatment of hypoglycaemia is with sugar, sweet drinks, or a glucagon injection (a hormone which has the opposite effect to insulin). Then you should eat a starchy snack such as a sandwich.
Type 1 diabetes treatment
Although diabetes cannot be cured, it can be treated successfully.
If a high blood sugar (glucose) level is brought down to a normal or near-normal level, your symptoms will ease and you are likely to feel well again. However, you still have some risk of complications in the long term if your blood glucose level remains even mildly high - even if you have no symptoms in the short term.
Studies have shown that people who have better glucose control have fewer complications (such as heart disease or eye problems) compared with those people who have poorer control of their glucose level.
Therefore, the main aims of treatment are:
To keep your blood glucose level as near to normal as possible.

To reduce any other risk factors which may increase your risk of developing complications. In particular, to reduce your blood pressure if it is high and to lead a healthy lifestyle.

Treatment aim 1 - keeping your blood glucose level near normal
How is the blood glucose level monitored?
It is likely you will need to monitor your blood sugar (glucose) levels by using a monitor at home. If you check your blood glucose level, ideally you should aim to keep the level between 4 and 7 mmol/L before meals and less than 9 mmol/L two hours after meals.
It may be best to measure your blood glucose level at the following times:
At different times in the day.

If you are unwell with another illness (for example, a cold or an infection).
Continuous glucose monitoring for all adults with type 1 diabetes
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has updated its guidance for people with type 1 diabetes. It recommends that all adults with type 1 diabetes should be offered a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device.
There are two types of CGM. Both involve wearing a tiny sensor inserted under your skin, usually on your tummy or arm. This sensor measures the glucose found in the fluid between the cells. The sensor tests glucose every few minutes. A transmitter sends the information to a monitor wirelessly. This allows you to have a much better idea of what your glucose levels are and whether they are going up or down.
Using CGM will mean you do not have to use finger-prick testing as often to monitor your blood glucose. Using CGM can help you keep your glucose closer to normal and reduce the risk of hypos.
Your diabetes specialist care team should discuss the options with you in detail and help you decide on, and use, a device.
Another blood test is called HbA1c. This test measures a part of the red blood cells. Glucose in the blood attaches to part of the red blood cells. This part can be measured and gives a good indication of your blood glucose control over the previous 1-3 months. This test is usually done regularly by your doctor or nurse. Ideally, the aim is to maintain your HbA1c to less than 48 mmol/mol (6.5%). However, this may not always be possible to achieve and your target level of HbA1c should be agreed between you and your doctor.
Insulin
To stay well and healthy you will need insulin injections for the rest of your life. Your doctor or diabetes nurse will give a lot of advice and instruction on how and when to take the insulin. Insulin is not absorbed in the gut (intestine) so it needs to be injected rather than taken as tablets. There are various types of insulin. The type or types of insulin advised will be tailored to your needs.
The six main types of insulin are:
Rapid-acting analogue - can be injected just before, with or after food. It tends to last between 2 and 5 hours and only lasts long enough for the meal at which it is taken.
Rapid-acting analogue - can be injected just before, with or after food. It tends to last between 2 and 5 hours and only lasts long enough for the meal at which it is taken.
Long-acting analogue - is usually injected once a day to provide background insulin lasting approximately 24 hours.
Long-acting analogue - is usually injected once a day to provide background insulin lasting approximately 24 hours.
Short-acting insulin - should be injected 15-30 minutes before a meal, to cover the rise in blood glucose levels that occurs after eating. It has a peak action of 2-6 hours and can last for up to 8 hours.
Short-acting insulin - should be injected 15-30 minutes before a meal, to cover the rise in blood glucose levels that occurs after eating. It has a peak action of 2-6 hours and can last for up to 8 hours.
Medium-acting and long-acting insulin - are taken once or twice a day to provide background insulin or in combination with short-acting insulins/rapid-acting analogues. Their peak activity is between 4 and 12 hours and can last up to 30 hours.
Medium-acting and long-acting insulin - are taken once or twice a day to provide background insulin or in combination with short-acting insulins/rapid-acting analogues. Their peak activity is between 4 and 12 hours and can last up to 30 hours.
Mixed insulin - is a combination of medium-acting and short-acting insulin.
Mixed insulin - is a combination of medium-acting and short-acting insulin.
Mixed analogue - is a combination of medium-acting insulin and rapid-acting analogue.
Mixed analogue - is a combination of medium-acting insulin and rapid-acting analogue.
Most people take 2-4 injections of insulin each day. The type and amount of insulin you need may also vary each day, depending on what you eat and the amount of exercise you do.
New types of insulin have become available called biosimilar insulins ('biosimilars'). These are biological copies of original insulins. They are cheaper than original insulins and therefore free up NHS resources to be used for other services that patients need. Your doctor may wish to discuss biosimilars with you. If you are well controlled on an existing insulin there is no need to change. However, if you jointly agree that changing to a biosimilar is appropriate, you will need to monitor your blood glucose more closely to make sure that good control is achieved.
Insulin pumps
Insulin pump therapy continually infuses insulin into the layer of tissue just beneath the skin (the subcutaneous tissue). Insulin pumps work by delivering a varied dose of fast-acting insulin continually throughout the day and night, at a rate that is pre-set according to your needs.
An insulin pump involves a lot of work and requires a high level of motivation from the person using it. These pumps are not suitable for everyone with type 1 diabetes. Your doctor will be able to discuss this with you in more detail.
Dr Krishna Vakharia, 29th January 2024
NICE has recommended hybrid closed loop (HCL) systems for managing blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetes. These are insulin pumps that automatically deliver the background insulin and vary the dose delivered by reading your CGM sensor and calculating the dose required. This means it reduces the burden for you to continuously monitor your blood glucose and work out how much insulin is needed. However, you would still need to manually calculate requirements at certain times such as meal times.
Currently, these can only be used under certain conditions and criteria. Your doctor will be able to discuss with you whether these would be beneficial for you.
For further reading on this - take a look at the further reading section.
Alternatives to injecting insulin
There has been plenty of research done in recent years to develop ways to administer insulin other than by injection. These have included insulin nasal and oral sprays, patches, tablets and inhalers. After many years of work, some of the methods being researched are showing a degree of success. However, it will be some time before any of these devices will be available to people with diabetes in the UK.
Healthy diet
You should eat a healthy diet. This diet is the same that is recommended for everyone. The idea that you need special foods if you have diabetes is a myth. Diabetic foods still raise blood glucose levels, contain just as much fat and calories and are usually more expensive than non-diabetic foods.
Basically, you should aim to eat a diet low salt and sugar and high in fibre and good fats and with plenty of vegetables. Fruit, though good for you, should be limited due to their high sugar content. However, you will need to know how to balance the right amount of insulin for the amount of food that you eat when living with type 1 diabetes. Therefore, you will normally be referred to a dietician for detailed advice.
The Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating and Exercise (DAFNE) programme is designed for people with type 1 diabetes. The programme provides information to show you how to manage your insulin doses to allow for a varied diet and for when you exercise.
Balancing insulin and diet, and monitoring blood glucose levels
Monitoring your blood glucose level will help you to adjust the amount of insulin and food according to the level and your daily routine.
Treatment aim 2 - to reduce other risk factors
You are less likely to develop complications of diabetes if you reduce any other risk factors. Everyone should aim to cut out preventable risk factors but people with diabetes have even more of a reason to do so.
Keep your blood pressure down
It is very important to have your blood pressure checked regularly. The combination of high blood pressure and diabetes is a particularly high risk factor for complications. Even mildly raised blood pressure should be treated if you have diabetes. Medication, often with two or even three different medicines, may be needed to keep your blood pressure down. See the separate leaflet called Diabetes and High Blood Pressure.
If you smoke - now is the time to stop
Smoking is a high risk factor for complications. You should see your practice nurse or attend a smoking cessation clinic if you have difficulty stopping smoking. If necessary, medication or nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine gum, etc) may help you to stop.
Do some physical activity regularly
Regular physical activity also reduces the risk of some complications such as heart and blood vessel disease. If you are able, a minimum of 30 minutes' brisk walking at least five times a week is advised. Anything more vigorous is even better - for example, swimming, cycling, jogging, dancing. Ideally you should do an activity that gets you at least mildly out of breath and mildly sweaty. You can spread the activity over the day (for example, two 15-minute spells per day of brisk walking, cycling, dancing, etc).
Other medication
Depending on your age and how long you have had diabetes, you may be advised to take a medicine to lower your cholesterol level. This will help to lower the risk of developing some complications such as heart disease and stroke.
Try to lose weight if you are overweight or obese
Excess weight is also a risk factor for heart and blood vessel disease. Getting to a perfect weight is often unrealistic. However, if you are overweight, losing some weight will help.
Some of these lifestyle issues may not seem to be relevant at first to young children who are diagnosed as having diabetes. However, as children grow, a healthy lifestyle should be greatly encouraged for the long-term benefits. See the separate leaflet called Cardiovascular Disease (Atheroma).
Treatment aim 3 - to detect and treat any complications
Most GP surgeries and hospitals have special diabetes clinics. Doctors, nurses, dieticians, specialists in foot care (podiatrists - previously called chiropodists), specialists in eye health (optometrists), and other healthcare workers all play a role in giving advice and checking on progress. Regular checks may include:
Checking levels of blood sugar (glucose), HbA1c, cholesterol and blood pressure.
Checking levels of blood sugar (glucose), HbA1c, cholesterol and blood pressure.
Ongoing advice on diet and lifestyle.

Checking for early signs of complications - for example:
Eye checks:
Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that if you are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as an adult, your GP should refer you straightaway to the local NHS eye screening service so a specialist can detect problems with the retina (a possible complication of diabetes) which can often be prevented from becoming worse.
If your eyesight suddenly becomes significantly worse, you should consult your GP or diabetes team promptly for referral to a specialist eye clinic.
Increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma) is also more common in people with diabetes, and can usually be treated. See the separate leaflet called Diabetic Retinopathy.
Urine testing - these include testing for protein in the urine, which may indicate early kidney problems. See the separate leaflet called Diabetic Kidney Disease.
Foot checks - to help to prevent foot ulcers. See the separate leaflet called Diabetes, Foot Care and Foot Ulcers.
Tests for the sensation in your legs to detect early nerve damage. See the separate leaflets called Diabetic Neuropathy and Diabetic Amyotrophy.
Blood tests - these include checks on kidney function, and other general tests. They also include checks for some autoimmune diseases which are more common in people with diabetes. For example, coeliac disease and thyroid disorders are more common than average in people with type 1 diabetes.

Immunisation
You should be immunised against flu (each autumn) and against infection from pneumococcal germs (bacteria) (just given once). These infections can be particularly unpleasant if you have diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes treatment
Type 2 diabetes diet
Type 2 diabetes can occur at any age, including during childhood, but it occurs mainly in people aged over 40. The first-line treatment is diet, weight control and physical activity.
The good news is that many people can stay well using these lifestyle measures. However if the blood sugar (glucose) level remains high then tablets to reduce the blood glucose level are usually advised. Insulin injections are needed in some cases. Other treatments include reducing blood pressure if it is high, lowering high cholesterol levels, and also other measures to reduce the risk of complications.

How do you explain type 2 diabetes to your child?
Dr. Partha Kar, FRCP
Type 2 diabetes and its symptoms tend to develop gradually (over weeks or months). This is because in type 2 diabetes you still make insulin (unlike in type 1 diabetes). However, you develop type 2 diabetes because:
You do not make enough insulin for your body's needs; or

Type 2 diabetes is much more common than type 1 diabetes.
How common is type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes develops mainly in people older than the age of 40 but type 2 diabetes is now becoming far more common in children and in young people.
The number of people with type 2 diabetes is increasing in the UK, as it is more common in people who are overweight or obese. It also tends to run in families. Type 2 diabetes is around five times more common in South Asian and African-Caribbean people (often developing before the age of 40 in this group). It is estimated that by 2025 more than 5 million people in the UK will be diagnosed with diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes symptoms
How do you know if you have type 2 diabetes?
As already mentioned, type 2 diabetes symptoms often come on gradually and can be quite vague at first. Many people have type 2 diabetes for a long period of time before their diagnosis is made.
The most common type 2 diabetes symptoms are:
Being thirsty a lot of the time.
Being thirsty a lot of the time.
Passing large amounts of urine.
Passing large amounts of urine.
Tiredness, which may be worse after meals.
Tiredness, which may be worse after meals.
The reason why you make a lot of urine and become thirsty is that if your blood sugar (glucose) rises too high (because insulin is not doing its job) the excess sugar leaks into your urine. This pulls out extra water through the kidneys.
As the type 2 diabetes symptoms may develop gradually, you can become used to being thirsty and tired and you may not recognise for some time that you are ill. Some people also develop blurred vision and frequent infections, such as recurring thrush.
However, some people with type 2 diabetes do not have any symptoms if the glucose level is not too high. But, even if you do not have symptoms, you should still have treatment to reduce the risk of developing complications.

The first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes involves making changes to your lifestyle, through diet, weight control and physical activity.
by Dr Colin Tidy, MRCGP
Type 2 diabetes diagnosis
How do you get tested for type 2 diabetes?
A simple dipstick test may detect sugar (glucose) in a sample of urine. However, this is not enough to make a definite diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, a blood test called HbA1c is needed to make the diagnosis. The blood test detects the level of glucose in your blood. If the glucose level is high then it will confirm that you have type 2 diabetes.
Some people have to have two samples of blood taken and may be asked to fast. (Fasting means having nothing to eat or drink, other than water, from midnight before the blood test is performed.)
It is now recommended that the blood test for HbA1c can also be used as a test to diagnose type 2 diabetes. An HbA1c value of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) or above is recommended as the blood level for diagnosing type 2 diabetes. An HbA1c blood test gives an average of how high your blood glucose levels have been over the preceding few months.
In many cases type 2 diabetes is diagnosed during a routine medical or when tests are done for an unrelated medical condition.
Type 2 diabetes complications
Short-term complication - a very high glucose level
This is rare with type 2 diabetes. It is more common in untreated type 1 diabetes when a very high level of blood sugar (glucose) can develop quickly. However, a very high glucose level develops in some people with untreated type 2 diabetes. A very high blood level of glucose can cause lack of fluid in the body (dehydration), drowsiness and serious illness which can be life-threatening.
Long-term complications
If your blood glucose level is higher than normal over a long period of time, it can gradually damage your blood vessels. This can occur even if the glucose level is not very high above the normal level. This may lead to some of the following complications (often years after you first develop type 2 diabetes):
Furring, or 'hardening', of the arteries (atheroma). This can cause problems such as angina, heart attacks, stroke and poor circulation.

The type and severity of long-term complications vary from case to case. You may not develop any at all. In general, the nearer your blood glucose level is to normal, the less your risk of developing complications. Your risk of developing complications is also reduced if you deal with any other risk factors that you may have, such as high blood pressure.
It has been found that people with type 2 diabetes are more at risk of periodontitis. This is a condition that destroys the tissues supporting your teeth. Untreated, this could lead to tooth loss. It can start with gingivitis which is an inflammation of the gums. Left untreated, this leads to periodontitis and further severe gum conditions.
At your annual review, your doctor will remind you to have checks with your dentist. If you do have periodontitis, managing this illness can improve blood sugar control so it is best to keep those regular reviews with your dentist.
Complications of type 2 diabetes treatment
Medications for type 2 diabetes, like most other medications, can cause side-effects in some people. You can find out more about diabetes medications and their side-effects from our separate leaflet called Type 2 Diabetes Treatment.
However, one important side-effect which can affect people taking insulin and/or certain diabetes tablets is hypoglycaemia (often called a 'hypo'). This occurs when the level of glucose becomes too low, usually under 4 mmol/L. Not all tablet medicines used for diabetes can cause a hypo - for example, metformin does not cause this.
A hypo may occur if you have too much diabetes medication, have delayed or missed a meal or snack, or have taken part in unplanned exercise or physical activity. You can find out more about the symptoms and treatments of hypos from our separate leaflet called Hypoglycaemia (Low Blood Sugar).
Until about 20 years ago, the medication options for treatment of type 2 diabetes were fairly limited. Insulin, along with a group of medicines called the sulfonylureas, can cause hypos (as well as weight gain). In the last 20 years, as newer medication has been developed, many people do not need to take sulfonylureas. In fact, more and more people never need to take insulin as newer agents offer more options for type 2 diabetes treatment.
Note: hypoglycaemia does not occur if you are treated with diet alone.
What are the aims of type 2 diabetes treatment?
If you have type 2 diabetes, you may think that keeping your blood sugar (glucose) at normal levels is all that matters. In fact, while that's important, there's more to treatment than this.
Treatment aim 1 - keeping your blood sugar (glucose) level at normal levels
Lifestyle changes are an essential part of treatment for all people with type 2 diabetes, regardless of whether or not they take medication.
Many people with type 2 diabetes can reduce their blood glucose (and HbA1c) to a target level with changes to their diet, weight and exercise levels. However, if the blood sugar (or HbA1c) level remains too high after a trial of these measures for a few months, then medication is usually advised.
Diet, weight control and physical activity
Diet. What you eat is absolutely central to your blood glucose control, as well as your general health. See the separate leaflet called Type 2 Diabetes Diet for more information. Your practice nurse or dietician can give you more information and support.

Lose weight if you are overweight. Getting to a perfect weight is unrealistic for many people. However, losing some weight if you are obese or overweight will help to reduce your blood glucose and blood pressure levels (and have other health benefits too). Recent evidence from Professor Taylor, Newcastle University, has shown that weight loss alone can put diabetes into drug-free remission in at least a third of patients.

Do some physical activity regularly. If you are able, a minimum of 30 minutes' brisk walking at least five times a week is advised. Anything more vigorous and more often is even better - for example, swimming, cycling, jogging, dancing. Ideally, you should do an activity that gets you at least mildly out of breath and mildly sweaty. You can spread the activity over the day - for example, two fifteen-minute spells per day of brisk walking, cycling, dancing, etc. Regular physical activity also reduces your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.

See the separate articles Can you reverse type 2 diabetes and How I reversed my type 2 diabetes.
Medication
Medication is not used instead of a healthy diet, weight control and physical activity - you should still do these things as well as take medication. See our separate leaflet called Type 2 Diabetes Treatment for more details.
How is the blood glucose level monitored?
The blood test that is mainly used to keep a check on your blood glucose level is called the HbA1c test. This test is commonly done every 2-6 months by your doctor or nurse.
The HbA1c test measures a part of the red blood cells. Glucose in the blood attaches to part of the red blood cells. This part can be measured and gives a good indication of your average blood glucose level over the preceding 1-3 months.
Type 2 diabetes treatment aims to lower your HbA1c to below a target level. Ideally, it is best to maintain HbA1c to less than 48 mmol/mol (6.5%). However, this may not always be possible to achieve and your target level of HbA1c should be agreed between you and your doctor.
If your HbA1c is above your target level then you may be advised to step up treatment (for example, to increase a dose of medication) to keep your blood glucose level down.
Some people with diabetes check their actual blood glucose level regularly with a blood glucose monitor. If you are advised to do this then your doctor or nurse will give you instructions on how to do it.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended that CGM should be offered to some people using insulin several times a day. They recommend that your specialist team should offer this if:
You have repeated or severe episodes of hypoglycaemia ('hypos').

Treatment aim 2 - to reduce other risk factors
You are less likely to develop complications of type 2 diabetes if you reduce any other risk factors. These are briefly mentioned below - see the separate leaflet called Cardiovascular Disease (Atheroma) for more details. Although everyone should aim to cut out preventable risk factors, people with diabetes have even more of a reason to do so.
Keep your blood pressure down
It is very important to have your blood pressure checked regularly. The combination of high blood pressure and diabetes is a particularly high risk factor for complications. Even mildly raised blood pressure should be treated if you have type 2 diabetes. Medication, often with two or even three different medicines, may be needed to keep your blood pressure down but remember weight loss and exercise can really help with this too.
See the separate leaflet called Diabetes and High Blood Pressure for more details.
If you smoke - now is the time to stop
Smoking is a major risk factor for complications. You should consult your practice nurse or attend a smoking cessation clinic - it's much easier to quit with support. As well as expert help and advice, medication or nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine gum, etc) may help you to stop.
Other medication
You will usually be advised to take a medicine to lower your cholesterol level. This will help to lower the risk of developing some complications such as heart disease, peripheral arterial disease and stroke.
Protect your kidneys
Keeping your blood glucose well controlled can reduce your risk of kidney damage. But a group of medications first developed to treat type 2 diabetes can provide added protection against developing and worsening chronic kidney disease.
These medicines, called SGLT-2 inhibitors, are now recommended for everyone with type 2 diabetes who has chronic kidney disease with protein in the urine. This is one of the reasons getting regular kidney checks (see below) is so important.
In fact, some medicines in this class are now used to protect the kidneys in people who have chronic kidney disease but who do not have diabetes.
You can find out more about the SGLT-2 inhibitors in our leaflet on type 2 diabetes treatment.
Treatment aim 3 - monitoring to detect and treat any complications promptly
Most GP surgeries and hospitals have special diabetes clinics. Doctors, nurses, dieticians, specialists in foot care (podiatrists - previously called chiropodists), specialists in eye health (optometrists) and other healthcare workers all play a role in giving advice and checking on progress. Regular checks may include:
Checking levels of blood sugar (glucose), HbA1c, cholesterol and blood pressure.

It is important to have regular checks, as some complications, particularly if detected early, can be treated or prevented from becoming worse.
Eye screening
Regular (at least yearly) eye checks can detect problems with the retina (a possible complication of diabetes), which can often be prevented from becoming worse. Increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma) is more common in people with diabetes and can usually be treated.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has updated its recommendations on eye screening and treatment in an update of its guidance on type 2 diabetes.
Eye checks usually include taking photographs of the back of your eye (retinal photography) to see whether there are any problems. This needs to be done at a specialist eye screening clinic.
The guidance recommends that:
You should be referred to a specialist local eye screening service as soon as you are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
You should be referred to a specialist local eye screening service as soon as you are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
If your eyesight suddenly deteriorates significantly without any obvious explanation, you should be referred to a specialist eye doctor (an ophthalmologist). How urgently you are referred will depend on your symptoms and personal circumstances.

Immunisation
You should be immunised against flu (each autumn) and also against pneumococcal germs (bacteria) - a vaccination just given once. These infections can be particularly unpleasant if you have diabetes.

Diabetes types
Diabetes is a group of diseases that affect how your body uses blood sugar (glucose). The scientific term for this is diabetes mellitus.
If your glucose level is high and remains high (hyperglycaemia), then you are likely to have diabetes. If the level goes too low, then it is called hypoglycaemia.
Below are the main types of diabetes and related conditions:
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: The immune system attacks the insulin-making cells in the pancreas. It usually presents in childhood and requires insulin injections.
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: The immune system attacks the insulin-making cells in the pancreas. It usually presents in childhood and requires insulin injections.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The body becomes resistant to insulin or does not make enough insulin. It usually presents in adulthood and is managed with diet, exercise, pills, and sometimes insulin.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The body becomes resistant to insulin or does not make enough insulin. It usually presents in adulthood and is managed with diet, exercise, pills, and sometimes insulin.
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM): Develops during pregnancy and usually resolves after woman gives birth. GDM increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes later.
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM): Develops during pregnancy and usually resolves after woman gives birth. GDM increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes later.
Non-Diabetic Hyperglycaemia (NDH): Blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diabetes. NDH, formerly known as prediabetes, increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes.
Non-Diabetic Hyperglycaemia (NDH): Blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diabetes. NDH, formerly known as prediabetes, increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes.
Blood glucose tests (blood sugar)
The main tests for measuring the glucose levels in the blood (blood sugar tests) are as follows.
Random blood glucose level
A blood sample taken at any time can be a useful test if diabetes is suspected. A level of 11.1 mmol/L or more in the blood sample indicates diabetes. A fasting blood glucose test may be done to confirm the diagnosis.
Fasting blood glucose levels
A glucose level below 11.1 mmol/L on a random blood sample does not rule out diabetes. A blood test taken in the morning before you eat anything is a more accurate test. Do not eat or drink anything except water for 8-10 hours before a fasting blood glucose test. A level of 7.0 mmol/L or more indicates that you have diabetes.
If you have no symptoms of diabetes but the blood test shows a glucose level of 7.0 mmol/L or more, the blood sugar test should be repeated to confirm you have diabetes.
If you have symptoms (such as increased thirst, frequent urination, and feeling very tired) and the blood test shows a glucose level of 7.0 mmol/L or more, the diabetes test doesn't need to be repeated.
Please see the separate leaflets called Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes for more details.
Oral glucose tolerance test
This test may be performed to check if a woman has developed diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes). It is also used when it is suspected that you have high blood sugar but not high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes. This condition is known as NDH.
The oral glucose tolerance test is not commonly used to diagnose diabetes anymore.
For this test, you fast overnight. In the morning you are given a drink which contains 75g of glucose. A blood sample is taken two hours later. Normally, your body should be able to deal with the glucose and your blood level should not go too high. A glucose level of 11.1 mmol/L or more in the blood sample taken after two hours indicates that you have diabetes. See the separate leaflet called Glucose tolerance test for more details.
The HbA1c blood test
If you have diabetes, your doctor or nurse may test your HbA1c levels every 3-6 months. This test measures your recent average blood glucose levels. Because it is an average measurement, you do not need to fast on the day of the test.
The test measures a part of the red blood cells. Glucose in the blood attaches to part of the red blood cells. This part can be measured and gives a good indication of your average blood glucose over the previous 2-3 months.
In the UK, HbA1c results are expressed in mmol/mol. This is in line with the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry. The non-diabetic, HbA1c 'normal' range is 20-42 mmol/mol.

For people with diabetes, treatment aims to lower the HbA1c level to below a target level, which is usually agreed between you and your doctor at regular check-ups.
Your HbA1c level should ideally be less than 48 mmol/mol (6.5%). However, this may not always be achievable, and the target level of HbA1c should be agreed upon individually by you and your doctor. This could involve increasing the dose of medication, improving your diet, and other measures.
The usual HbA1c target is 53 mmol/mol (7%) if the treatment includes a drug that causes hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The target may be adjusted based on factors such as potential side effects, other medical conditions, age, general health, and frailty.
The HbA1c test can also be used to diagnose diabetes. An HbA1c value of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) or above is the blood level for diagnosing diabetes. People with an HbA1c level of 42-47 mmol/mol (6.0-6.5%) are at increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This is called NDH). See the separate leaflet called Pre-diabetes (Impaired glucose tolerance) for more details.
Home monitoring
A drop of blood from a finger prick is placed on a test strip, which contains a chemical that reacts with glucose. The blood glucose level can be measured quickly using a colour chart or a small glucose meter machine. Home glucose monitoring is crucial for anyone with diabetes who needs insulin treatment. In this situation, checking the blood glucose several times a day is usually recommended.
Home monitoring is not available upon request in the NHS and is provided under certain circumstances, including the use of insulin therapy, having evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes, or taking a drug that may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia while driving or operating machinery.
New devices called flash glucose monitors or continuous glucose monitors can be worn by diabetics. Continuous glucose monitoring allows those with diabetes to check their blood glucose frequently without pricking fingers.
Urine test for glucose
Urine, produced by the kidneys, does not normally contain glucose. The kidneys filter our blood, retaining substances the body needs while eliminating waste products. Your kidneys constantly reabsorb glucose so that it does not enter the urine. However, if blood glucose levels rise above a certain threshold, the kidneys cannot reabsorb all of it. This means some glucose will 'spill' through the kidneys into the urine.
A simple urine dipstick test can detect glucose in a urine sample. In a dipstick test, a doctor or nurse uses a special chemical strip that they dip into a sample of your urine. Colour changes on the strip show whether there is glucose in the urine sample. If you have glucose in your urine, you are likely to have diabetes.
However, some people have kidneys that are more 'leaky', allowing glucose to enter the urine even with normal blood glucose levels. Therefore, if your urine contains any glucose, you should have a blood test to measure your blood glucose levels to confirm or rule out diabetes.
