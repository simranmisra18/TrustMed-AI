My 19 year-old daughter began having a racing pulse a couple of months ago (college student - didn't tell me at first). Her pulse can jump to 180/190 for no reason. Last weekend, her pulse spiked on Friday, then went down. On Saturday, she went for a walk, about 4mph, and her pulse was 132, then 96 while resting on Saturday, then in the 80s on Sunday. She also has chest pain. Last night, after walking a mile on the treadmill, she stopped because her chest hurt. She will be home for the three day weekend, so I made an appointment with her doctor on Monday. In the meantime, her pulse is normal today, but she says her chest hurts. My question is whether, with SVT, chest pain can happen while the pulse is normal, or only when it is elevate? She has a history of feeling like she is going to black out, but never has; light headedness upon standing (way more than I ever experience it); headaches. Thank you. I'm beside myself, as you can imagine.

Are you sure it is SVT? Chest pain and feeling lightheaded could also be lung related. Does she have any problem with her breathing? Is she on birth control pills? Does she smoke?

I’m not sure she has SVT , but am trying to sort through her symptoms to see if it matches.
She has had shortness of breath and chest pain when she tries to run for a long time. We went to the doctor about it 1.5 years ago. She did and EKG and chest xray. Also sent in for asthma testing. All asthma tests were normal, but still thought it could be exercise induced asthma and did not pursue heart further. Albuterol has never helped her breathing, as she would get shortness of breath periodically as a child.
She doesn’t smoke and is not on birth control pills.
I read that chest pain/tightness can be a symptom of SVT, but I’m assuming it is only while having an episode of racing pulse, not when pulse is normal.

I had SVT in 2015 with a resting heart rate of 230, but I don’t recall chest pains. I do get some now and again but I’ve put it down to a smoking connection. Get your doc to give a 24 hour ECG and see what comes up.
