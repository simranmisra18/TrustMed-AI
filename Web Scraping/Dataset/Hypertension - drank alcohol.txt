I have hypertension and my meds are “Candesartan 16mg” and “Iterium 1mg”.
I have been drinking alcohol with friends and now have 160/73 bloodpressure. (Which is elevated. My average would probaly be 140/something (diastolic value is normal most of the time)
Should i be taking my meds to calm my bloodpressure?
