I thought it was anxiety but knowing my 90 yo mom has afib i thought to test myself. sure enough i was 165 on Kardia mobile & then went down to 145. This all started about 3 hours ago. I just took another reading. I'm at 145 but I dipped briefly down to 123. So I'm hoping my heart is slowing down. How long does it take? can i drive?
