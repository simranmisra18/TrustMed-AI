Hi there, ive been experiencing breathing difficulties for the past year. before that i was living a very healthy lifestyle, running and going to the gym. i was sent for a ct angiogram a few months ago but it came back clear thankfully, but im still suffering with being out of breath even walking the dog ten mins is a challenge. My question is if i go for a private ct scan. how does this differ from the ct angiogram do they look for different things or would it be a waste of time. just need to know if a ct scan of my chest is the same as an ct angiogram
many thanks
chris
