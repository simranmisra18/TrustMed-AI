Hi
I’m a 34 YO guy who has been experiencing a bit of discomfort from Veins varicose on my feet.
For the context, I’m 1.84 cm tall, 72 kg and in reasonably good shape.
Since I was young I’ve always had the veins on my feet a bit pronounced (like bigger than the average), as the time went by tho these veins have grown and now I’m starting feeling a bit of discomfort (not pain but like the feeling of slightly tingling).
NOt sure about the root cause but when i was young like 15 YO I used to work as waiter in restaurants and pizzeria doing long hours (8 to 10) and having the bad habit of not drinking much water. i did this every weekend until i finished University.
In the last 10 years I’ve been working 8-5 in front of computers but I keep myself fit as much as i can. I don’;t smoke.
What would you suggest? is possible to remove varicose veins from the feet? I don’t have much problems on my legs, it’s manly my feet.
Thanks for your time and support
