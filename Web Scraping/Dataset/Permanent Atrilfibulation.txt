Hello, after having my aortic valve replaced 4 years ago my heart keeps going in and out of AF. I have a cardioversion and I’m ok for a while then it slips out of sinus again. My times in sinus have been 2.5 years, 6 months, 4 months and 6 weeks. I’m 58 , retired and have an active lifestyle. I love my running and being outdoors but being in AF puts an end to this. i can run about 50 m before I’m so out of breath i just have to stop. I’ve also had one ablation that lasted 4 months and have a second scheduled at the end of October. Really finding this depressing that I may be in AF for the rest of my life and just have to manage it. can anyone give me any hope here and if a node ablation and pacemaker may help.
thanks, Graham.
