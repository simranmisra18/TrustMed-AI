Holy crap, had some chest pain while working(as a Paramedic) and thought i was having an MI. Emerge found nothing of acute natural but recommended my to the heart clinic. I’m 51 male and run alot even though i smoke…weird i know. No family history and have always had high LDL since my early 20s. i also have severe anxiety and previous substance abuse history. Did stress test(pass), ECG(pass), Holter(pass), heart ultrasound( both ventricles slight dilation but valves and pump action all normal) nuclear CT heart teat(areas of decreased circulation) which led to a heart heart CT Angiogram with contrast which came back with 20-30% blockage in multiple arteries but the big one was the calcium score was 1200!!! my heart is literally turn into a bone. i’m so f’k s scared. i pick up heart attacks everyday at work. cardiologist said the plagues are stable and is in no rush to take immediate action. I’m on a statin, ASA and betablocker . my cardiologist doesn’t seem overly concerned which kinda pisses me off. FML
