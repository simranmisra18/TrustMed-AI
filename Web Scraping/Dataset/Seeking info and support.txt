Since I was a teenager, every few weeks/months I had this unpleasant sensation like my heart skips the beat. Often quite paralysing sensation.
Im 38 years old, over last year palpitations increased dramatically. On bad day I will have them every couple of hours, on good one maybe 3 times. I’m a dad and I’m worry about it a lot to be honest.
My doctor said my ECG is fine and 24 holster didn’t show anything worrying.
Any advice?
Thank you
