Hi everyone
I am 34 male, social smoker & drinking occasionally.
I am also overweight with a BMI of about 26.
Recently, my left chest is feeling compressed every now and then, and also shortness of breathe.
My BP is also slightly high most of the time.
I am very worried if it is heart condition. Anyone have any views of this?
