Hypoparathyroidism
If you have an underactive thyroid gland, the condition is called hypothyroidism. In hypothyroidism, there is a reduced level of thyroid hormone in the body. This can cause various symptoms, the most common being tiredness, weight gain, constipation, aches, dry skin, lifeless hair and feeling cold.
Treatment usually involves taking a daily tablet of thyroid hormone to replace the missing thyroxine. Treatment works very well for most people with hypothyroidism but is required for life.

What is hypothyroidism?
Neck cross-section showing the thyroid gland
The thyroid gland is located in the neck and produces thyroid hormones. These are called thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) and are carried round the body in the bloodstream. They help to keep the body's functions (the metabolism) working at the correct pace.
Many cells and tissues in the body need thyroxine to keep them going correctly. Thyroid hormones are released when the thyroid gland is stimulated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). This is a hormone released by another gland, in the brain. See the separate leaflet called Thyroid and parathyroid problems for further information about the thyroid gland.
Underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) results from the thyroid gland being unable to make enough thyroid hormones, so that many of the body's functions slow down. Thyroid hormone levels are lower than normal. So some people call it having a 'low thyroid'. Hypothyroidism may also occur if there is not enough thyroid gland left to make thyroxine - for example, after surgical removal or injury.
Hypo- means not enough and hyper- means too much. If you have hyperthyroidism, you make too much thyroxine. This causes many of the body's functions to speed up. See the separate leaflet called Overactive thyroid gland (Hyperthyroidism) for more information.
Hypothyroidism symptoms
Many symptoms of having an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) can be caused by a low level of thyroxine. Basically, many body functions slow down. Not all symptoms develop in all cases.
Symptoms and signs that commonly occur include:
Tiredness.
Weight gain.
Constipation.
Aches.
Feeling cold.
Dry skin.
Dull or coarse hair.
Fluid retention.
Mental slowing.
Depression.

However, all these symptoms can be caused by other conditions and sometimes the diagnosis is not obvious. Symptoms usually develop slowly and gradually become worse over months or years as the level of thyroxine in the body gradually falls.
What are the possible complications of hypothyroidism?
If you have an untreated underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism):
You may feel generally unwell due to the symptoms above.

Who develops hypothyroidism?
Having an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) is ten times more common in women than it is in men. In the UK, around 1-2 in 100 people have hypothyroidism. It most commonly develops in adult women and becomes more common with increasing age. However, it can occur at any age and can affect anyone.
What causes hypothyroidism?
Autoimmune thyroiditis - the most common cause in the UK
The most common cause of having an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) is an autoimmune disease called autoimmune thyroiditis. The immune system normally makes antibodies to attack bacteria, viruses and other germs. If you have an autoimmune disease, the immune system makes antibodies against certain tissues of your body.
If you have autoimmune thyroiditis, you make antibodies that attach to your own thyroid gland, which affect the gland's function. The thyroid gland is then not able to make enough thyroxine and hypothyroidism gradually develops. It is thought that something triggers the immune system to make antibodies against the thyroid. The trigger is not known.
Autoimmune thyroiditis is more common than usual in people with:
A family history of hypothyroidism caused by autoimmune thyroiditis.

Down's syndrome. Hypothyroidism develops in 1 in 3 people with Down's syndrome before the age of 25 years. Symptoms of hypothyroidism may be missed more easily in people with Down's syndrome. Therefore, some doctors recommend that all people with Down's syndrome should have an annual blood test to screen for hypothyroidism.

Some people with autoimmune thyroiditis also develop a swollen thyroid gland (goitre). Autoimmune thyroiditis with a goitre is called Hashimoto's disease. Also, people with autoimmune thyroiditis have a small increased risk of developing other autoimmune conditions such as vitiligo, pernicious anaemia, etc.
Surgery or radioactive treatment to the thyroid gland
If the thyroid gland has been damaged or destroyed by treatment (for another thyroid disorder, or for other problems in the neck), it may not produce enough thyroid hormone.
Other causes
Other causes of hypothyroidism include:
Worldwide, iodine deficiency is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. (Your body needs iodine to make thyroxine.) This affects some countries more commonly than others, depending on the level of iodine in the diet.

A pituitary gland problem is a rare cause. The pituitary gland that lies just under the brain makes a hormone called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This stimulates the thyroid gland to make thyroxine. If the pituitary does not make TSH then the thyroid cannot make enough thyroxine. This is called secondary hypothyroidism.

How is hypothyroidism diagnosed?
A blood test diagnoses an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). A normal blood test will also rule it out if symptoms suggest that it may be a possible diagnosis. One or both of the following may be measured:
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This hormone is made in the pituitary gland. It is released into the bloodstream. It stimulates the thyroid gland to make thyroxine. If the level of thyroxine in the blood is low, then the pituitary releases more TSH to try to stimulate the thyroid gland to make more thyroxine. Therefore, a raised level of TSH means the thyroid gland is underactive and is not making enough thyroxine.

Therefore, a raised level of TSH means the thyroid gland is underactive and is not making enough thyroxine.

Thyroxine (T4). A low level of thyroxine confirms hypothyroidism. Test results might be described as having 'low thyroid levels' or a 'low thyroid'.
A test for thyroid antibodies may be done to confirm the diagnosis if the cause is thought to be autoimmune. Other tests are not usually necessary unless a rare cause of hypothyroidism is suspected.
For example, tests of the pituitary gland may be done if both the TSH and thyroxine levels are low. If you have a swollen thyroid gland when the doctor examines you (a goitre), you would usually have an ultrasound scan.
Subclinical hypothyroidism
Some people have a raised TSH level but have a normal T4 level. This means that you are making enough thyroxine but the thyroid gland is needing extra stimulation from TSH to make the required amount of thyroxine. In this situation you have an increased risk of developing hypothyroidism in the future.
Your doctor may advise a repeat blood test to see if you do eventually develop hypothyroidism. In many people, the blood test returns to normal on its own without treatment. So usually the test is repeated in three months rather than starting treatment straightaway. See the next section on hypothyroidism treatment for recommendations on treatment.
Hypothyroidism treatment
The treatment of underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) is to take levothyroxine (thyroxine) tablets each day. This replaces the thyroxine which your thyroid gland is not making. Most people feel much better soon after starting treatment.
Ideally, take the tablet on an empty stomach (at least half an hour before breakfast). This is because some foods rich in calcium or iron may interfere with the absorption of levothyroxine from the gut. (For the same reason, don't take levothyroxine tablets at the same time of day as calcium or iron tablets.)
Caffeine can also interfere with absorption of levothyroxine so avoid tea and coffee for half an hour after taking the tablet also.
Some other medicines can also affect thyroxine levels so ideally do not take levothyroxine with any other tablets. Check with your pharmacist if you do need to take another tablet at the same time.
What is the dose of levothyroxine?
Most adults need between 100 and 200 micrograms daily. A low dose is prescribed at first, especially in those aged over 60 or with heart problems. The dose is then gradually increased over a period of time. Blood tests are usually taken regularly and the dose may be adjusted accordingly. It may take a few months for you to start to feel better.
The blood test measures TSH (see above). Once the blood TSH level is normal it usually means you are taking the correct amount of levothyroxine. It is then common practice to check the TSH blood level once a year.
Women who are planning a pregnancy may need to adjust their dose of levothyroxine; as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, they should increase their levothyroxine dose by 25-30%. Speak to your doctor if you have an underactive thyroid and are planning a pregnancy.
Also, as you get into late middle age and older, you may need a reduced dose of levothyroxine.
Missed a tablet?
Everyone forgets to take their tablets from time to time. Don't worry as it is not dangerous to miss the odd forgotten levothyroxine tablet. If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember if this is within two or three hours of your usual time.
If you do not remember until after this time, skip the forgotten dose and take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses together to make up for a missed dose. However, you should try to take levothyroxine regularly each morning for maximum benefit.
Other dosing routines have been studied. However these have only been explored in small studies and are not routinely recommended. It may be that levels will not be as steady if the medicine is not taken in a daily dose.
The best advice based on currently available evidence is to take the tablet once a day regularly. If you are having problems with this, discuss it with your doctor or pharmacist.
How long is the treatment for?
For most people, treatment is for life. Occasionally, the disease process reverses. This is uncommon, apart from the following:
Children. Sometimes hypothyroidism is a temporary condition in older children. (This is not so for children who are born with an underactive thyroid gland.)
Children. Sometimes hypothyroidism is a temporary condition in older children. (This is not so for children who are born with an underactive thyroid gland.)
Pregnancy. Some women develop thyroid imbalance after having a baby. If it occurs, it typically happens about three to six months after the birth. Often this lasts just a few months and corrects itself. Treatment is needed only in a small number of cases. However, afterwards it is wise to have a yearly blood test, as there is an increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroiditis and long-term hypothyroidism in the future.

What if it doesn't work?
Most people feel better once their blood tests have returned to normal with levothyroxine. In a small percentage of people, however, the blood tests go back to normal but they don't feel any better. If this is the case, you would normally be referred to a specialist (an endocrinologist).
The specialist doctor may do some more tests to check your symptoms are definitely due to hypothyroidism rather than something else. They will also check there is nothing interfering with your levothyroxine (such as other medication).
What is liothyronine?
Liothyronine is a manufactured form of triiodothyronine (T3).
UK guidelines recommend that T3 and combinations of T4 and T3 should not routinely be prescribed. The Royal College of Physicians does not recommend that T3 should ever be prescribed.
It says there is not enough evidence that it helps patients and not enough evidence to be sure it is not harmful. Clinical practice guidelines worldwide do not recommend or support the routine use of combination (LT4 and LT3) therapy.
The NHS recommends that:
Treatment with liothyronine should never be started in primary care (by a GP).
Treatment with liothyronine should never be started in primary care (by a GP).
Patients who are currently taking liothyronine should be reviewed by a consultant NHS endocrinologist with a view to switching to levothyroxine if appropriate.
Patients who are currently taking liothyronine should be reviewed by a consultant NHS endocrinologist with a view to switching to levothyroxine if appropriate.
The British Thyroid Association states that a small number of patients have symptoms which do not improve on levothyroxine. For these, a consultant NHS endocrinologist may recommend a carefully monitored trial of liothyronine.

You can find out more from the further reading links to CKS hypothyroidism and NHS England guidance.
Treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2019 guidelines recommend giving levothyroxine replacement therapy even if your T4 level is normal, as long as your TSH level is raised over 10 mIU/L on two separate occasions three months apart. This blood result picture - normal T4 but raised TSH - is called 'subclinical hypothyroidism'.
These guidelines also suggest that a six-month trial of levothyroxine for adults aged under 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism should be considered, if you have a TSH lower than 10 mlU/L on two occasions three months apart, and also have some symptoms of hypothyroidism.
Treatment for hypothyroidism in pregnancy
Pregnant women taking levothyroxine should be monitored by a specialist (endocrinologist). Pregnancy can affect the amount of medication needed, and it is very important that levels do not get either too high or too low.
Are there any side-effects or problems from treatment?
Levothyroxine tablets replace the body's natural hormone, so side-effects are uncommon. However, if you have angina, you may find that your angina pains become worse when you first start levothyroxine. Tell a doctor if this happens.
If you take too much levothyroxine it can lead to symptoms and problems of an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) - for example:
The sensation of a 'thumping heart' (palpitations).

This is why you need blood tests to check that you are taking the correct dose.
Other medicines may interfere with the action of levothyroxine - for example, carbamazepine, iron tablets, phenytoin, and rifampicin. If you start any of these medicines, or change the dose, you may need to alter the dose of the levothyroxine. Your doctor will advise. Also, if you take warfarin, the dose may need to be altered if you have a change in your dose of levothyroxine.
Free prescriptions
In the UK, if you have hypothyroidism, you are entitled to free prescriptions. This is for all your medicines, whether related to the hypothyroidism or not. Ask at your GP surgery for a form to fill in (form FP92A) to claim this benefit.
What is the outcome (prognosis)?
Most people get better on levothyroxine treatment, although they usually have to stay on it for ever. If you are treated for hypothyroidism, a blood test each year is needed to make sure you are still on the right dose. As above, about 5 or 10 in 100 people will not feel any better on levothyroxine, even though their blood tests go back to normal. This may be more difficult to treat (as discussed above).
People who have subclinical hypothyroidism may or may not need treatment. In nearly 4 out of 10 people with subclinical hypothyroidism, the blood tests go back to normal on their own, without treatment ever being needed.
Very rarely, people who have not had their hypothyroidism treated develop a serious complication called myxoedema coma. This is rare but is very serious and can cause death.

Hyperthyroidism is an uncommon condition where your thyroid gland (which is in your neck) goes into 'overdrive'. It produces too much of a chemical called thyroxine. We all have a certain amount of thyroxine in our bodies to keep us working at just the right 'energy level'. If too much thyroxine is made, you can become very ill with tiredness, a fast heartbeat and weight loss.
Initially the symptoms can mimic lots of other conditions. However, the diagnosis is usually made with a simple blood test. A number of treatments are available which makes hyperthyroidism fairly easy to treat: tablets are the mainstay of treatment, followed by radiotherapy. Occasionally surgery is needed.

What is hyperthyroidism?
Neck cross-section showing the thyroid gland
Hyperthyroidism means an overactive thyroid gland. When your thyroid gland is overactive it makes too much thyroxine.
The extra thyroxine causes many of your body's functions to speed up. In contrast, if you have hypothyroidism, you make too little thyroxine; this causes many of the body's functions to slow down. See the separate leaflet called Underactive thyroid gland (Hypothyroidism) for more information.
Thyroxine is a body chemical (hormone) made by your thyroid gland. It is carried around your body in your bloodstream. It helps to keep your body's functions (your metabolism) working at the correct pace. Many cells and tissues in your body need thyroxine to keep them going correctly.
Thyrotoxicosis is a term that may be used by doctors instead of hyperthyroidism. The two terms mean much the same.

Most people with hyperthyroidism do not have all the symptoms but a combination of two or more is common. Symptoms usually develop slowly over several weeks. All the symptoms can be caused by other problems and so the diagnosis may not be obvious at first. Symptoms may be mild to start with but become worse as the level of thyroxine in your blood gradually rises.
How common is hyperthyroidism?
About 1-2 in 100 women and 2 in 1,000 men in the UK develop an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) at some stage of their lives. It can occur at any age but it is more common as you become older.
What are the causes of hyperthyroidism?
There are various causes of having an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). They include the following:
Graves' disease
This is the most common cause. It can occur at any age but is most common in women aged 20-50 years. It can affect anyone but there is often a family history of the condition. There may also be family members with other autoimmune diseases (for example, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia gravis).
Graves' disease is also an autoimmune disease. The immune system normally makes tiny proteins (antibodies) which travel in your bloodstream to attack bacteria, viruses and other germs.
In autoimmune diseases, the immune system makes antibodies against tissues of your body. If you have Graves' disease, you make antibodies that attach to your thyroid gland. These stimulate your thyroid gland to make lots of thyroxine. It is thought that something triggers your immune system to make these antibodies. The trigger is not known.
In Graves' disease the thyroid gland usually enlarges, which causes a swelling (goitre) in the neck. See the separate leaflet called Goitre (Thyroid swelling). The eyes are also affected in about half of cases. If they are affected, your eyes are pushed forwards and look more prominent (proptosis). This can cause discomfort and watering of your eyes.
Problems with eye muscles may also occur and lead to double vision. It is not clear why eye symptoms occur in some people who have Graves' disease. They may be due to the antibodies affecting the tissues around the eye. See the separate leaflet called Thyroid eye disease for more details.
Thyroid nodules
This is a less common cause of hyperthyroidism. Thyroid nodules are lumps which can develop in your thyroid gland. It is not clear why they develop. They are usually non-cancerous (benign) but contain abnormal thyroid tissue.
Some thyroid nodules are non-functional (don't produce any thyroid hormone) but some do, and those are the ones that can rarely cause hyperthyroidism. The abnormal thyroid tissue in some thyroid nodules does not respond to the normal controlling system which normally ensures that you make just the right amount of thyroxine. Therefore, if you have a thyroid nodule, you may make too much thyroxine.
Sometimes only one nodule forms. This is called a toxic solitary adenoma. This most commonly occurs in people aged between 30 and 50 years.

Note: the word toxic above, relating to adenomas or multinodular goitres, does not mean poisonous. It is just one of those medical words which refers to the hyperthyroidism.
Other causes
There are several other rare causes of hyperthyroidism. For example, some people who take the medicines amiodarone and lithium develop hyperthyroidism. There are various other rare conditions which result in excess thyroxine being made.
How is hyperthyroidism diagnosed?
A blood test can diagnose having an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). A normal blood test will also rule it out if symptoms suggest that it may be a possible diagnosis. One or both of the following may be measured in a blood sample:
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This chemical (hormone) is made in the pituitary gland in the brain. It is released into the bloodstream. It stimulates the thyroid gland to make thyroxine. If the level of thyroxine in the blood is high then the pituitary gland releases less TSH. Therefore, a low level of TSH means that your thyroid gland is overactive and is making too much thyroxine.

If the level of thyroxine in the blood is high then the pituitary gland releases less TSH. Therefore, a low level of TSH means that your thyroid gland is overactive and is making too much thyroxine.
Thyroxine (T4). A high level of T4 confirms hyperthyroidism.
Thyroxine (T4). A high level of T4 confirms hyperthyroidism.
Sometimes the results of the tests are borderline. For example, a normal T4 but with a low TSH. Other tests are sometimes done to clarify the situation and the cause. For example, another blood test that measures T3 is sometimes helpful and an ultrasound scan of the thyroid gland or a thyroid scan may be done if you have a nodular goitre.
Also, if tests are borderline, one option is to repeat the tests a few weeks later, as sometimes borderline tests are due to another illness. Other tests may be done if a rare cause of hyperthyroidism is suspected.
In people with Graves' disease a blood test may detect specific autoantibodies which are commonly raised. However, these can also be raised in some people without Graves' disease so this is not a specific test for Graves' disease.
See the separate leaflet called Thyroid function tests for more information.
Hyperthyroidism treatment
The main aim of treatment of an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) is to reduce your level of thyroxine to normal. Other problems, such as a large thyroid swelling (goitre) or associated eye problems, may also need treatment.
Factors such as the underlying cause of the problem, your age and the size of any goitre are taken into account to decide on the best treatment plan.
Treatment options include the following:
Antithyroid medicines
Antithyroid medicines can reduce the amount of thyroxine made by the overactive thyroid gland. The most common medicine used in the UK is carbimazole.
Carbimazole does not affect the thyroxine which is already made and stored but reduces further production. Therefore, it may take 4-8 weeks of treatment for your thyroxine level to come down to normal. The dose of carbimazole needed to keep the thyroxine level normal varies from person to person. A high dose is usually given initially which is then reduced as your thyroxine levels come down.
Carbimazole is usually taken for 12-18 months at first. After this, in about half of cases, the condition will have settled down and the carbimazole can be stopped. If the condition flares up again some time in the future, a further course may be needed. However, in these cases an alternative treatment (for example, radioactive iodine) is often recommended.
In about half of cases, carbimazole needs to be continued long-term to control symptoms. A different treatment may then be a better option if you do not want to take carbimazole long-term.
Warning: carbimazole can, rarely, affect your white blood cells which fight infection. Whilst taking carbimazole, you should see a doctor urgently for a blood test if you develop any of the following:
A high temperature (a fever).
A high temperature (a fever).
A sore throat.
A sore throat.
Mouth ulcers.
Mouth ulcers.
You should also stop taking carbimazole until you receive further instruction from your doctor.
Taking carbimazole in early pregnancy slightly increases the risk of certain birth defects in the baby. An alternative medicine, propylthiouracil, is safer, and usually used instead for women who are planning a pregnancy, or become pregnant. Carbimazole is safe to take if you are breastfeeding. If you are planning a pregnancy, speak to your endocrinologist about the options for medication.
Radio-iodine
This involves taking a drink, or swallowing a capsule, which contains radioactive iodine. The main use of iodine in your body is to make thyroxine. Therefore, the radioactive iodine builds up in your thyroid gland.
As the radioactivity is concentrated in your thyroid gland, it destroys some thyroid tissue which reduces the amount of thyroxine that you make. The dose of radioactivity to the rest of your body is very low and is not dangerous. However, it is not suitable if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. In addition, after treatment, women should not become pregnant for at least six months and men are advised not to father children for at least four months.
Following radio-iodine treatment, you should avoid prolonged contact with others for a specified time. This may be for 2-4 weeks, depending on the amount of radio-iodine you receive. The aim is to limit the exposure of radioactivity to others. For the specified period you will be advised to take precautions such as:
Limit close contact with babies, children or pregnant women. Close contact means being within one metre; so, for example, don't cuddle children or allow them to sit on your lap.

Your specialist will give more detailed advice regarding these precautions.
Surgery
This involves removing part of your thyroid gland. It may be a good option if you have a large goitre which is causing problems in your neck. If too much thyroid tissue is removed then you will be given thyroxine tablets to keep your thyroxine level normal.
It is usually a safe operation. However, as with all operations, there is a very small risk of complications.
Thyroid replacement therapy
It can be difficult for a doctor to judge just the right dose of carbimazole, or just the right amount of radio-iodine, to give in each case. Too much treatment may make your thyroxine level go too low. Not enough treatment means your level remains higher than normal. Regular blood tests are needed to check on the thyroxine level.
One option is to take a high dose of carbimazole each day deliberately, or to receive a one-off high dose of radio-iodine. This stops your thyroid gland making any thyroxine. You will then need to take a daily dose of thyroxine tablets to keep your blood level of thyroxine normal. This over-treatment and then taking replacement thyroxine is called 'block and replace'.
Treatment for eye problems
You may need to see an eye specialist if you develop the eye problems of Graves' disease. Relatively minor symptoms affect the eyes in about half of people with Graves' disease. Measures such as artificial tears, sunglasses and eye protectors whilst you sleep may be sufficient to help.
However, about 1 in 20 people with Graves' disease have severe eye changes. Treatment can then be more difficult and may include surgery, radiation treatment or steroid tablets.
If you smoke then it is important that you try to stop. Smoking can actually make your eye problems worse.
Beta-blocker medicines
Some people are given a beta-blocker medicine (for example, propranolol, atenolol) for a few weeks whilst the level of thyroxine is reduced gradually by one of the above treatments.
Beta-blockers can help to reduce symptoms of tremor, the sensation of having a 'thumping heart' (palpitations), sweating, agitation and anxiety.
Complications of hyperthyroidism
If you have untreated hyperthyroidism:
You have an increased risk of developing heart problems such as abnormal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), a weak heart (cardiomyopathy), angina and heart failure.

You have an increased risk of developing fragile bones (osteoporosis).
With treatment, the outlook (prognosis) is excellent as most of the symptoms and risks of complications go.
Follow-up
Regular checks are recommended, even after you finish a successful treatment for an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism).
It is very important to have a regular blood test (at least every year) to check that you have the right level of thyroid hormone (thyroxine) in your blood. Your GP may do this test. This is because some people become hyperthyroid again at some time in the future.
Others who have been treated successfully develop an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) in the future. If this occurs, it can usually be treated easily with thyroxine tablets.

This leaflet gives a brief overview of the pituitary gland and the hormones it makes. The pituitary gland is found at the base of the brain and is 'pea-sized'. The pituitary gland is an overall controller of a number of other glands in the body, overseeing the function of these organs through hormones.

Some of the pituitary gland disorders
Pituitary disorders generally occur when the pituitary gland is either too active or not active enough. Often there is a discrete piece of pituitary gland which leads to the problems, this is called a pituitary adenoma (if it is large it may be called pituitary macroadenoma). These are usually benign, non-cancerous tumours. Pituitary adenomas can cause problems through:
Releasing excess of one or more hormone.
Releasing excess of one or more hormone.
Not releasing any hormones but pressing on the normal pituitary tissue and thus interfering with normal function; and/or

How are pituitary gland disorders diagnosed?
The diagnosis usually involves hormone blood tests and also brain scans. Hormone blood tests can be taken randomly for some hormones, but others may require specialised testing with substances that should provoke the release or prevent release in certain conditions.
This may require attendance at a day unit and having several hormone blood tests throughout the day. Usually an MRI scan of the pituitary gland is undertaken to look for pituitary abnormalities - eg, pituitary adenoma or cysts.
What is the treatment for pituitary gland disorders?
This will depend upon the cause. If there is hormone deficiency then this may need replacement with tablets. If a tumour is discovered as the cause of the problems then pituitary surgery may be required.
This is usually via the nose. If there is a pituitary tumour which is found to be cancerous then radiotherapy may be needed after surgery. There may also be a need for lifelong hormone replacement following any treatment.
What is the pituitary gland?
The pituitary gland is located in the brain and is an endocrine gland. This means that it produces chemicals called hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers which help different organs in the body communicate with each other. The pituitary gland is one part of a messenger system.
The pituitary gland helps to control the body's functions by releasing hormones into the bloodstream. These hormones are transported in the blood to their target. Here they usually cause the release of a second hormone.
The target can either be specialised endocrine glands or other types of body tissue such as groups of cells.
The pituitary gland is sometimes called the master gland because it controls several other hormone-releasing glands. Some of the glands the pituitary gland controls are the thyroid gland, the ovaries, the testicles (testes) and the adrenal glands.
Where is the pituitary gland located?
About the size of a pea, the pituitary gland is found at the base of the brain, behind the bridge of your nose. The pituitary gland is very close to another part of the brain, called the hypothalamus.
The pituitary
The pituitary gland has two main parts:
The part of the pituitary gland at the front, called the anterior pituitary.
The part of the pituitary gland at the front, called the anterior pituitary.
The part of the pituitary gland at the back, called the posterior pituitary.
The part of the pituitary gland at the back, called the posterior pituitary.
These two parts release different hormones which are aimed at different parts of the body.
There is also a section between the two main parts, called the intermediate part, which releases a single hormone. The final part of the pituitary gland is the stalk, which connects the posterior pituitary to the hypothalamus.
How does the pituitary gland work?
The body is in a constant state of change. Heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature all change in response to what you do and your surroundings. The body has systems that constantly monitor these and other vital functions. Not only must these systems monitor changes, they must also respond to the changes and help the body to restore balance.
Some of these systems involve the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. The hypothalamus and the pituitary gland are part of several loops or circuits. The loops include other glands. The hormones produced by each gland complete the loops by travelling in the bloodstream between them.
The hypothalamus receives information from many sources about the basic functions of the body. It uses the information it receives to help regulate these functions. One of the ways the hypothalamus does this involves controlling the pituitary gland. The hypothalamus does this by using its own hormones to communicate with the pituitary gland.
Among the information monitored by the hypothalamus is the level of various hormones in the blood. The hypothalamus has special cells which receive information from the body indicating how much of each hormone is present in the bloodstream.
When these hormones drop below a particular level this stimulates the hypothalamus to release hormones. These hormones travel to the pituitary gland, acting as the signal to the pituitary gland to produce one or more of its hormones.
The hormones produced by the pituitary gland are released into the bloodstream. The bloodstream transports the pituitary hormones to other endocrine glands, such as the thyroid gland.
The pituitary gland hormones may then stimulate their target endocrine glands to produce their own hormones. These locally produced hormones do the actual work of regulating your body.
Take the example of the control of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland in the neck. The hypothalamus produces a hormone called thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TRH travels to the pituitary gland and stimulates it to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).
TSH travels to the thyroid gland and stimulates it to release thyroid hormones, T3 and T4. When levels of T3 and T4 get high enough, levels in the bloodstream are detected by the hypothalamus.
The hypothalamus then knows to stop releasing more TRH. This last part of the loop is called negative feedback and prevents hormone levels from rising too high.
Regulation of thyroid hormones
The anterior pituitary produces hormones that regulate a wide range of bodily activities, from growth to reproduction. Whether a hormone is released by the anterior pituitary is governed by the hypothalamus. There are at least seven different hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary produces just two hormones.
Hormone released
Main target
Function
Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)
Adrenal glands
Stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. Cortisol is important in controlling your metabolism, blood sugar levels and blood pressure. It is also an anti-inflammatory agent and helps your body to resist certain stresses such as bleeding or fasting.
Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
Ovaries -women
Testicles (testes) - men
Stimulates the ovaries to produce an egg (ovum) for fertilisation. Also causes an increase in the hormone oestrogen.
Stimulates the testicles to produce sperm.
Growth hormone (GH)
Many different cells of the body
The most well-known effect in children is to increase height. In adults and children it helps to control the amount of muscle and fat in the body. It also helps to heal injuries and it promotes your immune system.
Luteinising hormone (LH)
Ovaries - women
Testicles - men
Triggers ovulation - the release of an egg (ovum) ready for fertilisation.
Stimulates cells in the testes to produce testosterone.
Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH)
Brain (not known for sure)
The exact role in humans is unknown. It may influence brain activity. When too much is present, it may cause darkening of the skin.
This is also produced in the intermediate part of the pituitary gland.
Prolactin
Breasts
Together with other hormones, prolactin stimulates the breasts to produce milk. It is also found in women who aren't pregnant. Men also have prolactin but its function is not understood well.
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
Thyroid gland
TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to produce its own hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4).
These hormones help to control many bodily functions, including heart rate, temperature and metabolism.
Hormone released
Main target
Function
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
Kidneys
Decreases urine production. (It causes more water filtered by the kidneys to be returned to the blood. This reduces the amount of urine.)
ADH also causes a rise in blood pressure.
Oxytocin
Breasts and womb (uterus)
Stimulates contraction of the womb during childbirth. Helps breasts to release milk.

Synacthen test
Peer reviewed by Dr Toni Hazell, MRCGPLast updated by Dr Philippa Vincent, MRCGPLast updated 27 Jul 2023
Meets Patient’s editorial guidelines
A synacthen test checks the function of the adrenal glands. It can help to see whether the adrenal glands are producing enough steroid hormone (cortisol).
Note: the information below is a general guide only. The arrangements, and the way tests are performed, often vary between different hospitals. Always follow the instructions given by your doctor or local hospital.
In this article:

How does a synacthen test work?
What happens during a synacthen test?
What is a synacthen test used for?
What are the adrenal glands?
Where are the adrenal glands found?

Are there any side-effects or complications from a synacthen test?
Who cannot have a synacthen test?
What is a synacthen test?
A synacthen test uses a special chemical to test how well the adrenal glands make a chemical (hormone) called cortisol. It involves stimulating the adrenal glands and then checking to see if they respond. Synacthen is another name for tetracosactide, the chemical used in the test.
How does a synacthen test work?
During the synacthen test a chemical called tetracosactide is given (synacthen is the commercial name of this chemical). Tetracosactide is a chemical copy of ACTH.
ACTH is the chemical (hormone) released by the pituitary gland which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. If the adrenal glands are working properly they should respond to the tetracosactide by producing cortisol. Levels of cortisol are checked by taking a blood sample.
If levels of cortisol remain low, despite the tetracosactide injection, this suggests there is a problem with the function of the adrenal glands. See the separate leaflet called Addison's Disease for more details.
What happens during a synacthen test?
A synacthen test can be carried out in several different ways. Your local hospital will tell you how the test is to be carried out.
It is usual to be asked to come into hospital first thing in the morning. Here a sample of blood will be taken to see how much cortisol is present before the adrenals are stimulated. A small needle called a cannula may be put into a vein in the back of your hand. This allows doctors to take blood samples and give the tetracosactide.
An injection of tetracosactide will then be given, either into a vein via the cannula or sometimes into a muscle.
In the so-called 'short synacthen test' (which is the usual test), a sample of blood will be taken again approximately 30 minutes after receiving the injection of tetracosactide. This is to measure the levels of cortisol in the blood to see if the adrenals have responded to the tetracosactide.
Less commonly, a 'long synacthen test' is used. In this type of test, a blood sample is given at the start of the test. After the injection of tetracosactide, blood samples are taken at regular intervals over a 24-hour period.
What is a synacthen test used for?
A synacthen test is used to check the function of the adrenal glands. It can also give doctors information about how your hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal glands work together. The test may also be used to diagnose Addison's disease.
A one-off measurement of blood cortisol is not accurate enough to diagnose Addison's disease as it may be low from time to time in normal people.
What are the adrenal glands?
The adrenal glands are endocrine glands. This means they make and release (secrete) hormones. Hormones are chemicals which are released into the bloodstream. They act as messengers, affecting cells and tissues in distant parts of the body. The adrenal glands produce hormones which help to control a number of the body's functions.
Where are the adrenal glands found?
There are two adrenal glands, one of which is found just above each kidney. About the size of a walnut, each adrenal gland has an outer part (adrenal cortex) and an inner part (adrenal medulla). Cells in different parts of the adrenal glands make different chemicals (hormones).
What do the adrenal glands do?
Cells in the outer part of the adrenal glands (the adrenal cortex) make the chemicals (hormones) cortisol, aldosterone and androgens.
Cortisol is a steroid hormone and is vital for health. It has many functions which include:
Helping to regulate blood pressure.
Helping to regulate the immune system.
Helping the body to respond to stress.
Helping to balance insulin in regulating blood sugar (glucose) level.

Androgens are hormones such as testosterone. These hormones contribute to growth and reproduction in men and women.
How do the adrenal glands work?
Each adrenal chemical (hormone) is controlled in a different way.
The release of cortisol is controlled by hormones produced by two parts of the brain - the hypothalamus and the pituitary. The hypothalamus receives input from the body about the state of many different bodily functions.
When the hypothalamus senses levels of cortisol are low, it releases a special hormone called corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). CRH travels to the pituitary gland via the connecting blood vessels. CRH stimulates the pituitary gland to release (secrete) adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
ACTH is released into the bloodstream and travels to the adrenal glands. Here ACTH causes cells within the outer part of the adrenal glands (the adrenal cortex) to make more cortisol.
High levels of cortisol stop the hypothalamus and pituitary gland from secreting more of their hormones. This system ensures that cortisol should only be made when the level of cortisol in the body is too low.
Pituitary and adrenal glands
What should I do to prepare for a synacthen test?
Usually there is very little preparation needed for a synacthen test. Your local hospital should give you more information if you need to do anything specific.
Are there any side-effects or complications from a synacthen test?
There are usually no side-effects from a synacthen test apart from a small bruise which may appear at the place where the needle was inserted. Rarely, the vein used to take the blood may become swollen; this usually settles within a few days.
Who cannot have a synacthen test?
This test cannot be used in someone who is pregnant or has had a reaction to synacthen in the past. It is usual to have to wait at least six weeks after having an operation on the pituitary gland before having this test.
Someone taking the oral contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy is usually asked to stop this six weeks before having the test. Steroid tablets should not usually be taken for 24 hours before this test. Topical steroids (via inhalers, nasal sprays or creams) should be discussed with the doctor requesting the synacthen test.
