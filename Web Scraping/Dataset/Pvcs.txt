i am a 53 year old female and have suffered with PVcs for probably 30 years, doc first put it down to anxiety and prescribbed antidepressents which i was on for over 10 years didnt help so took myself to a cardiologist, had all the tests and they picked up several pvcs actually couldnt beleive the amount, tested for Afib fine and just said I had a happy heart, mmm…been on medication Cardicor 2.5mg and propafenone 300mg twice a day did calm them down but still had them,.
Been vaccinated 5 times all Pfizer no problem but contracted covid in Feb 23 and the PVCs have not stopped every single day, anxiety unbeleivable as I think I’m going to die, currently having bloods and ecg in the next couple of weeks. I feel for all of you because these are so scary and and no one can find anything wrong. see what happens this time fi gers crossed

hi lisa.
I’m sorry you are suffering with these horrible palpitations too. Mine are everyday aswell somedays not so bad other days horrendous sometimes with multiple in a row which scare me so much. I’ve had 2 24hr ecgs and an echocardiogram which was normal I’m currently waiting for a 7 day ecg which I’ll have put on in 10 days.
its just so hard to believe that they aren’t dangerous they are really taking over my life I really hope you start to feel better soon and find relief from these horrible things.
