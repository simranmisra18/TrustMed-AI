I noticed that when I’m stressed or anxious, or have had sodium or coffee(even decaf) as too much of that even since it contains some caffeine..I get ecopics but mine are NOT skipped beats but extra beats and they are sometimes less noticeable, then some are more noticable and then some are painful… and I notice the number/frequency is related to the amount of stress my body is in and how much lack of sleep I experience..I have no other symptoms. I never get them while working out ot active, which is a good sign. Only when I’m sitting, standing and in a tense mood and also underslept. I guess I’m not the only person on the planet with this reaction to stress or caffeine or am I?

no you’re not alone. Everyone’s experience is different. Theyre real make you feel sad or depressed in my case because they can’t be explained. We must try to deal with anxiety and not be super aware of our bodys responses. Much easier said than done. Good luck with your feelings. They’re so much harder to get a hold on
