Hello to all,
to the people who have already an ablation, i assume that it is normal to have heart palpitations during the first weeks, no ? I read that the first period is not counted to properly determine if the operation has succeeded or not.
I had my ablation last week and sometimes, i feel that the palpitations are more severe than before. I guess that it depends on the recovery of every person (at least i hope).
And for athletes, when do you resume your sport activities ? I am taking 2 weeks as a full rest but I am planning to begin one week from now.
I am a gym guy; I heard that weight training isn’t the best option for people suffering from arrhythmia since the heart doesn’t like to work under intervals.
Please share your experience.
Thanks in advance
