On March 25th, I had a cardiac MRI, which showed no abnormalities. I wanted to make sure that I could resume sports activities. Six weeks later, I felt very tired without any apparent reason and went to the hospital, where blood was drawn, including Troponin T hs, EKG, CK, and BNP tests upon my request. The EKG was normal, but the Troponin T hs showed slightly elevated values of 16 (reference range: 0-14). The doctor explained that it was of no significance and discharged me. A week prior, I had already undergone a cardiac ultrasound and EKG at a cardiologist’s, which also came back normal. Due to fear of a possible myocarditis due to the slight Troponin elevation, I have refrained from doing any sports since then. The Troponin level normalized after just one day and has remained within the normal range since. Three months later, I underwent another cardiac MRI and stress EKG, both of which showed normal results. The radiologist ruled out the presence of myocarditis.
However, I have read that a rest period of 3-6 months is recommended for myocarditis. Despite receiving assurances from all cardiologists that I could resume sports, I am still unsure if it’s a good idea to do so, considering that the Troponin elevation occurred just three months ago, and theoretically, myocarditis could have been present at that time.
i just felt fatigue during the minimal elevation but since then i dont have any symptoms. i had 1 MRI,3 heartultrasounds and 16 times blood drawn since then with normal troponin t hs. i have strong cardiophobia thats why i repeated this examinations
(Doctors Tell me that Sport could have caused the minimal elevation but the Last Time i did exercises was 1 week prior) male 24
