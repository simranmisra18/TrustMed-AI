Hello Everyone, i have recently diagnosed with ASD. i have a hole in my heart which they accidentally found. I didnt have any symptoms. They heard a murmur and did TOE to find out the size of the hole. As the size of the whole is big they recommended open heart surgery. i am waiting to hear from the surgeon who will go though with me the open heart surgery procedure. I have been very stressed and anxious. I have never had any major op done so really scared and finding hard to sleep.
Has anyone had a similar surgery? what is recovery like? please share your experience

Hi martin23
I’ve never had any major surgeries either and I sympathize with you. I have a lot of chronic autoimmune illness. One thing I do know is that stress and anxiety does not help. Try to stay strong- I know it is difficult. I wish you the best.

The exam period is a stressful time. For young people sitting their SATs, GCSEs, A-levels or university exams, it’s common to feel overwhelmed and anxious. And watching your child experiencing stress as they sit exams can be very hard too. However, there are steps you can take to help them cope.
