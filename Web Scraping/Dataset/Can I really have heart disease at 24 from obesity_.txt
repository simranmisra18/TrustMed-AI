So I'm a 24 year old guy 6'1" and 310 lbs. 53" waist. my diet is pretty bad with mostly fat and sugars, no protein. A lot of trans fat too from frying my chicken in shortening. I also have hypertension at 170/90. don't exercise at all, sitting all day. Is it really a possibility that i will develop heart disease anytime soon?
