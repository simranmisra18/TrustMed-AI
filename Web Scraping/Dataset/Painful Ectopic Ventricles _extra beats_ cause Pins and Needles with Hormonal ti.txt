hi guys, 31 year old female, began experiencing regular ectopic beats about a year ago. the first day they were happening regularly enough to panic me and I got an ambulance to ER. they recorded "ectopic ventricles". i have had a 24 hour halter that didn't catch any, but I knew that as the timing in my cycle was wrong. they are problematic and more frequent around ovulation and as period starts. the halter showed some anomalies so referred to cardiologist who requested stress echo. whole Corona thing happened so they did my consult over the phone. stress echo showed "extra beats" but nothing to concern them. I am willing to accept it's just something I'll have to live with but I still occasionally get a scary episode. it always Happens in bed at night, again very related to where I'm at in my cycle. I'll have a super forceful ectopic that makes my head SPIN and a rush of pins and needles all over my body. sometimes a Sharp stabbing pain in left breast at same time. have had ones so violent I jolt upright grasping my chest completely uncontrolled. afterwards I am sort of overcome by a warm and calm sensation. very different to the normal extra beats I feel sometimes over the course of the day. does anyone else have similar?

I’ve had two very violent ones that knocked me off my feet. Once I hit the floor and the other time landed on my bed as I was getting undressed.

wow! and you’ve had medical opinions that they’re just ectopics and not a danger?

Hi Megan, i haven’t had all my tests, but Dr. listened to my heart, heard extra beat. Ekg showed extra beat, Blood work was ok. Have to have echocardiogram, and 24 monitor. I have those sensations too. It’s so miserable and scary.

yes! I’ve experienced this! same timing, worse during ovulation and cycle, painful, and sometimes makes me grasp my chest. I also get a hollow feeling in my chest and neck and shoulder pain. I have also had many other symptoms in addition to these.
