Hello everyone,
I wanted to share my story and see if anyone here has experienced something similar (i saw a similar topic but i feel like its differents)
Around 2015 (10 years ago), I suddenly began having severe burning / needle-like pain all over my skin
These painful “crises” were always triggered whenever my body heated up: exercise, hot environments, sneezing, laughing, even strong emotions.
The pain was so intense that my first instinct was to use cold water to get relief.
At first, doctors told me it might be cholinergic urticaria, so I tried countless antihistamines, but none of them ever worked. Over time, I realized my condition was very different from the usual urticaria cases I read about.
The situation became disabling:
The pain was unbearable, I could not go outside, I had to stop my studies, and I was unable to do any physical activity.
I also noticed that I had almost completely stopped sweating, except for a little bit under my armpits. Even when I tried to heat up my bathroom, put on a rain jacket, and force exercise, I only felt the terrible pain but no sweat at all.
A specialist in internal medicine later prescribed me high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone) combined with methotrexate (Metoject). After about a month of treatment, something incredible happened: while laughing hard at a funny video, I had no pain crisis for the first time in years, and instead I noticed sweat on my back. From that moment, the crises disappeared whenever I could sweat. It felt like a miracle after 10 years of suffering.
The big issue is that steroids cannot be used long-term. Each time the dose is reduced, the crises gradually come back. Now, when I exercise, I sometimes have to go through a very painful crisis first, before sweat finally comes and the pain stops. But as the steroid doses got lower, the crises have been returning more and more, and recently (after a year without strong steroids), it feels like I am going backwards again.
My main question:
Has anyone here experienced this combination of excruciating skin pain triggered by heat + inability to sweat (anhidrosis / hypohidrosis), that improved when sweating was restored (e.g. with steroids or other treatments)?
This condition has been life-changing and stopped my life completely. I would really like to know if someone found a long-term solution or treatment.
I didn’t go into detail about the whole 10 years before, but it was basically treatment after treatment with no results, until this particular treatment about a year ago finally gave me some relief.
