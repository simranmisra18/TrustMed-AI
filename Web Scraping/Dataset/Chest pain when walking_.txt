I have not been diagnosed yet and waiting for heart scan but Dr not convinced it is Angina but i get a pain when walking even after a few minutes . can start in stomach, goes through to chest and back and sometimes neck - feels like have run too far, kind of burn/press. If i stop it goes. started in Jan but stopped with diet and medication like asprin and statin - cholesteol is 3.3 and BP is fine - I generally feel fine but not sure what this could be and annoyed it has come back. anyone else had it where it comes on everytime you do something even a little physical?
