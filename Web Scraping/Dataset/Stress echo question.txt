I had a stress echo all looked good but I am questioning the following results. Measurements Aortic valve Value Mean v, S 0.8 m/sec Mean grad, S 3 mm Hg Ascending aorta Value AAo AP diam, S 3.2 cm AAo AP diam/bsa, S 1.4 cm/m 2 Legend: (L) and (H) mark values outside specified reference range
Thank you in advance for any thoughts
