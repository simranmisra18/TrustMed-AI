Hi, I’m Yusif. I’m 17 years old.I am from Russia myself.I’m from a small village, I live without mom and dad, I only have grandparents.4 months ago, I began to suffer from an anxiety personality disorder.But that’s not the point , extrasystoles appeared against the background of the disorder , I’m quite used to them , they are usually single from 300 to 2000 thousand a day .I was diagnosed with polymorphic extrasystoles of 3 degrees Down on the halter half a year ago..But recently a terrible thing happened, if it was an ordinary extrasystole, the heart stopped fluttering in different directions, some kind of somersault, then with pain and an ordinary blow .In general, I felt very well the strongest coups in my chest, I do not know how many of them there were, but it felt like it was ventricular tachycardia or ventricular tachycardia in a different way it feels like heartbeats with normal tachycardia if yes, then no, I had something else, then the knock of extrasystole fluttering in different directions, I could not understand what a steam room is extrasystole if it feels like 2 blows to the chest , then I understand , but I had exactly a shaking of the heart without tremors , the jolt was only then with pain in another part of the chest it lasted 3-4 seconds .I am very afraid that it was a CT scan of the heart that is healthy and an IVF ECG too.I cry for 2 days, I’m afraid to eat what to do , I take 5-10 mg of propranol per day.After that, I was thrown into a sweat , the usual tachycardia and fear of death began .I don’t know, I didn’t understand something, but I’m very scared it’s been 2 days and so far it hasn’t happened all the time, hand on heart.Help me sort out my feelings.
