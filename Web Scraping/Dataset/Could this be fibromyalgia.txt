No one seems to know what is wrong with me! I have had so many blood tests and am waiting for a 24 hour heart monitor but meanwhile I feel terrible on many days. Two months ago I had a stomach infection which resolved in about a week. However, since then I am lightheaded and have pains and weakness in my lower legs and sometimes in other parts of the body, including headaches from time to time. I feel I am living in a fog physically as my head never feels totally clear. Some days I feel I am getting better only to have a bad following day. I cannot identify any triggers. All my blood tests are Ok though I do have a form of blood cancer that affects the platelets. But I have had that for 4 years and never had any symptoms, only since the stomach infection. I will have to speak to my GP again but both she and my hematology team are baffled. I realize no one here can diagnose me but just wondering if anyone else can relate.
