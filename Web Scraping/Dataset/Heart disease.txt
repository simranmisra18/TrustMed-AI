I have a family member that is paranoid about developing heart disease at a very young age, despite not being a smoker and not being largely overweight and having no immediate family risk factors!
They think this because they describe feeling typical textbook angina-like symptoms when they get worked up after an argument or when doing a stressful task (hoovering a car out, putting a flat pack furniture together).
The relative is only 29, a non smoker, weighs around 85kgs and is a moderate drinker with absolutely zero immediate family heart disease. Because of the paranoia, the relative has had in excess of 35 ECG tracings at random intervals and a stress test on the treadmill and an echocardiogram. All the tests were normal BUT being in the medical field myself I do know that the only way of visualising the arteries is with a contrast CT or an angiogram.
Is there any wisdom you guys can give to help them relax a little about it all? Of course NOTHING is impossible in life and I’m sure there has been previous cases in the world where heart disease has been misdiagnosed BUT I would like to think in that very, very small group of unfortunate people they would not have been so focused on the heart as my relative and were CERTAINLY unlikely to have had so many random ECG tests .. therfor making early detection impossible for them.
