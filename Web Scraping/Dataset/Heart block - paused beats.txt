hi,
I have been experiencing what feels like pauses in my heart beat. It was extremely bad last night with a pause every 3-6 beats continiously.
I had an echo a few months ago which was normal but the 24hr ecg showed signs of heart block on 9 occassions.
I was also diagnosed with high blood pressure at the same time which is now under control.
this has been going on for about 8 months but nothing was as bad as last night and now I am worried. I have been referred to the cardiologist just over a month ago and still waiting for an appointment.
Has anyone experienced similar?
