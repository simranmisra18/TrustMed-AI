The results of the four independent clinical studies on Peak Performance. Now we invite you to put the pack to the test. The studies showed results in participants in as little as 60 minutes and even greater results over time.* Now is your time to create your own personal proof of their effectiveness! Simply request a blood draw and lab work from your physician and record your numbers in the BEFORE section of this worksheet. Then take any Peak Performance Pack (including Peak Performance Heart Health, Peak Performance Bone & Joint, Peak Performance Brain Health, and Peak Performance Total Health) consistently (AM and PM packs daily) for 90 days. Revisit your physician for a follow-up blood draw. Record those numbers on the AFTER section of this worksheet. (This challenge was specifically created for those who have never taken the Peak Performance Pack or have not taken it in the last 12 weeks.)
If someone would like to try the test let me know, so I could send you more info.
