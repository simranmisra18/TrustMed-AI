Hello i had a heart attack in September 2022 and since then have had eptopic beats on and off. Sometimes they are so bad day and night over 2,000 i’m getting really scared and depressed over them. They are scaring me to the point i am struggling on a daily basis. Is anyone else experiencing the same thing
