Missed periods can happen for many reasons. Most of the time there is no worrying cause. As long as you are sure you are not pregnant and you feel well in yourself there is no need for concern if you miss one or two periods.
If you don't have a period for 3-6 months, or have other symptoms then you should consult a doctor. Sometimes periods in teenage girls start later than in others. If your periods haven't started by the time you are 16 (or 14 if you have not started developing in other ways such as getting pubic hair and breasts) then contact your doctor.
Periods can also be infrequent, erratic or irregular. If you bleed between your periods or after sex, or after the menopause, you should discuss this with your doctor.

Causes of a missed period
Often there is nothing to worry about when periods stop, and no serious cause. There are certain times when it is normal not to have periods. These include:
Before puberty. Girls start to go through puberty from around the age of nine years and their periods start a year or two later. Up until that point girls do not have periods.

After menopause. The menopause is the time in your life when your ovaries stop producing eggs and you stop having periods. The average menopause is around the age of 51. You will be classed as having gone through the menopause a year after your last period. However, it is extremely common for your periods to become less regular in the years leading up to the menopause. See the separate leaflet called Menopause (including HRT) for more details.

If you are using certain types of contraception. Some types of contraception may stop periods. They do not do so in all women; however, it is normal not to have periods (or to have very light periods) if you are using:
The contraceptive progestogen-only pill (POP, or mini-pill).
The levonorgestrel intrauterine device - sometimes called a coil.
A progestogen contraceptive injection.
A progestogen contraceptive implant.

Stress
Stress affects the chemical messengers called hormones which are released from your brain. These hormones then go on to affect other hormones released from your ovaries which normally trigger your periods. Stress or a sudden shock can stop your periods in this way. Usually if this is the case, they resume naturally over some time.
How much stress can cause a late period?
Low body weight
Losing weight may result in periods stopping. This can occur if your body mass index (BMI) goes below 19. If you have an eating disorder called anorexia nervosa, losing too much weight can result in your periods stopping.
It may also happen to athletes, gymnasts, long-distance runners and people who do an excessive amount of exercise. There is a condition called RED-S (Relative Energy Deficiency in Sports) which occurs in athletes and can cause missed periods along with other symptoms.
What does weight have to do with missed periods?
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
PCOS is a common condition which can cause periods to be very infrequent or sometimes stop altogether. Women with PCOS may have other symptoms such as difficulty losing weight, spots (acne) and too much body hair. See the separate leaflet called Polycystic ovary syndrome for more details.
Hormone problems
A number of conditions which affect hormone levels may cause missed periods. This includes:
A condition where a hormone called prolactin is too high. This is called hyperprolactinaemia. The most common cause of this is a non-cancerous (benign) growth in the brain, called a prolactinoma.
A condition where a hormone called prolactin is too high. This is called hyperprolactinaemia. The most common cause of this is a non-cancerous (benign) growth in the brain, called a prolactinoma.
Conditions affecting a gland in your neck, called the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland produces hormones which may affect periods. If you are producing either too much hormone (hyperthyroidism) or too little (hypothyroidism), your periods may be affected.

Genetic problems
Genes are the building blocks of our cells and give us our individual characteristics. Genetic conditions are due to abnormal genes. In rare cases, abnormal genes can be a cause of not having periods. In most of these, there will be primary amenorrhoea (ie periods never start).
One example of this is Turner syndrome. In this condition, girls tend to be short, have particular features and have ovaries which do not work properly. They often do not start periods when other girls of their age do. See the separate leaflet called Turner syndrome for more details.

Other genetic conditions may cause differences in genitals and female organs. For example, in a condition called androgen insensitivity syndrome, the child has female genitals outside but no female organs on the inside. With no ovaries or womb (uterus), these children will not have periods.

Occasionally babies do not develop normally in the womb before birth and may be born with problems which will prevent periods. For example, rarely a girl may be born without a vagina, or with a blockage in the vagina. Sometimes the first time this is apparent is when she does not start to have periods as expected.
Early menopause
The average time for women's periods to stop in the UK is at the age of 51. However, there is quite a wide range. If periods stop before the age of 40, this is very early and is said to be premature menopause. If periods stop between 40 and 45 years of age, it is called early menopause. At the menopause, periods stop and there are usually other symptoms of menopause such as hot flushes.
Medicines and medical treatment
As discussed above, a number of contraceptive treatments can stop you having periods. Other medicines can affect periods too. Examples are some medicines for schizophrenia (antipsychotic medicines), an anti-sickness medicine called metoclopramide and strong painkillers called opiates.

A number of operations may result in absent periods. For example, after a hysterectomy you will not have periods. A hysterectomy is an operation where the womb is removed. As the blood during a period comes from the womb, you will never have periods again afterwards.
Another operation (called endometrial ablation), which is sometimes done for heavy periods, also causes periods to stop. In this operation the lining of the womb is removed. This is not usually permanent and periods start again in time.
Treatments for cancer, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy, can also damage the ovaries and result in absent periods. Recreational drugs such as heroin may also cause periods to stop.
Getting back to normal after stopping contraception
When you have been on the combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill or an injection form of contraception, it can take a while for your periods to restart once you stop the contraception. It can take a few months for your body's own cycle to restart and it can take several months before you have a period.
What should I do if I have not started my period?
Girls start their periods at a very variable age. So it may be that your friends have been having periods for a while but you have not. Usually this will be normal variation and nothing to worry about. Ask your doctor's advice if:
You are 16 years old or older and still have no periods.

What should I do if I have missed my period?
Don't panic! In most cases there is nothing serious going on. The most important thing to do is to do a pregnancy test if there is any chance at all you could be pregnant. If you otherwise feel well in yourself, and you are not pregnant, then the chances are your periods will start up again in due course.

Will I need any tests for a missed period?
If you go to see a doctor about your periods stopping, first of all the doctor will ask you some questions. For example, the doctor will want to know:
If you have ever had periods and whether they were regular.

If you have any other symptoms, such as hot flushes or milk leaking from your breasts. (Hot flushes may suggest an early menopause; milk leaking from your breasts suggests high levels of the hormone prolactin, discussed above.) The doctor may also ask about signs of pregnancy such as morning sickness or tender breasts.
If you have any other symptoms, such as hot flushes or milk leaking from your breasts. (Hot flushes may suggest an early menopause; milk leaking from your breasts suggests high levels of the hormone prolactin, discussed above.) The doctor may also ask about signs of pregnancy such as morning sickness or tender breasts.
Your doctor may then wish to examine you. The doctor may want to check your weight and height and then work out your BMI. They may also want to feel your tummy. They may want to look for signs of possible causes. (For example, excess body hair suggesting PCOS, or a lump in the neck suggesting a problem with the thyroid gland.) In some cases an internal examination may be needed.

Whether further tests are needed will depend on what has been discovered from talking to you and examining you. You may not need any tests at all. Tests which may be needed include:
A pregnancy test (usually checked from a sample of urine).
A pregnancy test (usually checked from a sample of urine).
Blood tests. These are done to check out a number of possible causes. They may be done to check hormone levels (such as thyroid hormones and prolactin as discussed above, or the levels of hormones coming from the ovary). Occasionally tests for gene abnormalities may be needed.

How are absent periods treated?
This depends on the cause. In many cases no treatment is needed. See the specific leaflets about the various causes for information on how each is treated.
Are there any complications of missed periods?
In the short term, there are no complications of missing a few periods. However, if it goes on for a longer time, it may cause some problems.
Infertility
Women who are not having periods may not be producing eggs from their ovaries (ovulating). This would mean they would not be able to become pregnant naturally. For some women this may be an issue. However, for many causes, there is treatment to help with this, so discuss it with your doctor if you want to become pregnant. See the separate leaflet called Infertility for more details.
Weak bones (osteoporosis)
When the absent periods are combined with low levels of the female hormone oestrogen, there may be a risk of bones weakening. Oestrogen helps keep bones strong, and they start to weaken after menopause.
If they become excessively weak and break (fracture) easily, this is called osteoporosis. This only applies to women who have not had a period for a long time (a year or more). It is particularly a risk for women whose periods have stopped due to early menopause, weight loss, anorexia nervosa or excessive exercise.
Heart disease
It is suspected that low oestrogen levels also put a woman at risk of heart disease. Also women with PCOS are more likely to develop risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and diabetes. A healthy diet is particularly important for women with PCOS to reduce the risk.
Irregular periods
Other patterns of periods which are different to normal may also occur, as follows.
Infrequent or erratic periods
Having periods less often than normal is called oligomenorrhoea. The causes of this are much the same as the causes of absent periods discussed above. The most common cause is PCOS.
Bleeding between periods
There are many causes for bleeding between periods. It is common in the first 2-3 months after starting the combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill.
In all other circumstances, contact your doctor if you have bleeding between your periods or bleeding after sex. You will need an examination and possibly some tests to find out the cause.

What is pruritus vulvae?
'Pruritus vulvae' simply means itching of the vulva. The vulva consists of the external female sex organs, including the labia, clitoris, Bartholin's glands and the area of skin just outside the vagina. Pruritus vulvae is also often associated with vaginal irritation or itchiness.
Most women experience a slightly itchy vulva from time to time. However, pruritus vulvae means the itch is persistent and causes distress. The itch may be particularly bad at night and may disturb sleep.
About 1 woman in 10 sees a doctor about a persistently itchy vulva at some stage in her life. Vulval itching can affect any woman, at any age. It can lead to scratching and rubbing which can break the skin and can lead to soreness, bleeding and skin infections. It can also affect a woman's sex life, making sex uncomfortable.
Itchy vulva causes
An itchy vulva (pruritus vulvae) can be caused by many different conditions.
Causes of an itchy vulva tend to differ slightly between adults and children. However, they can include the following:
Infections
Thrush. This is a common cause of vulval and vaginal itching in women from the age of puberty to the menopause. It is very uncommon in younger girls and also less common in older women. It is often caused by antibiotic use. It can be associated with a thick white discharge, typically described as appearing like cottage cheese.

Threadworms. This very commonly causes itchiness of the vulva and vagina, particularly at night. It can also cause a sensation of needing to pass urine. This is very common in children but also occurs in adults.

There is also an increased chance of vaginal discharge and thrush during pregnancy, which may also cause itch.
Breastfeeding
Women who are breastfeeding have lower oestrogen levels than normal (similar levels to women in the peri-menopause and menopause) and this can cause an itchy vulva and vaginal itching. Local oestrogen can be prescribed if needed (as described above). The oestrogen levels return to normal by about 6 months or sooner if breastfeeding is stopped earlier than this. Symptoms resolve once the oestrogen levels have returned to normal.
Generalised body itch
Any cause of generalised body itch may also cause an itchy vulva. For example, a generalised body itch may be a side-effect of some medicines or due to some blood disorders, thyroid problems or kidney or liver disease. Some people describe a generalised body itch for which no cause can be found.
Diabetes
Can cause an itchy vulva, particularly if the diabetes is not well controlled and sugar levels are tending to run high.
Cancer of the vulval skin
This is an uncommon cause.
This is an uncommon cause.
Usually there is a lump or growth that can be seen alongside the symptoms of itchiness.
Usually there is a lump or growth that can be seen alongside the symptoms of itchiness.
Precancerous changes such as vulval intraepithelial neoplasia -VIN - can also cause itchiness. You can read more about this condition.
Stress
Stress can cause an itchy vulva. An itchy vulva or vaginal itching which is due to another cause can also persist longer (even when the other cause has been treated) due to stress.
Unknown causes
In some cases, including some severe cases, no cause can be found for an itchy vulva.
When should I see a doctor for an itchy vulva?
Medical advice should be sought for an itchy vulva or vaginal itching that is persisting and not settling.
Thrush is easily treated with medication bought over the counter (tablets, pessaries or cream) but, if the symptoms are not settling within a week, medical advice should be sought.
Do I need to be examined for an itchy vulva?
Usually a pelvic examination will be needed after a description of the symptoms. Examination will probably involve a medical professional looking at the skin of the vulva and may also involve an internal (vaginal) examination.
They may need to ask you quite personal questions about sexual practices and will usually suggest that swabs should be taken from the vulva and/or vagina to look for infection.
Sometimes symptoms will suggest a particular condition which can be treated without an examination, with advice to come back if the symptoms do not resolve. This is typical of threadworms and can also be the case with thrush.
Pre-pubertal girls will often not need to be examined and will never need an internal examination. If they do need to be examined the healthcare professional will usually just look at the area and not need to touch it. Vulvovaginitis is a very common cause of an itchy vulva or vaginal itching in young girls and the vulval skin can look red and sore. The advice will usually be to avoid any products (including soap or bubble bath) and to avoid washing hair in the bath so that the vulva does not come into contact with shampoo in the water. It is best to avoid using wet wipes and to use toilet paper gently but ensuring that the area is dry and clean.
Other tests
Sometimes, other tests may be suggested, including blood tests - for example, to look for diabetes, or thyroid, kidney or liver problems.
Referral to a dermatologist or gynaecologist with a special interest in dermatology may be suggested in order to arrange skin patch testing to determine if there is something that may be sensitising and causing irritation of the vulval skin. This may be a type of contact dermatitis.
Rarely, a doctor may need to examine the vulval skin in detail using a type of microscope called a vulvoscope. Taking a sample (biopsy) of the vulval skin may be suggested. This would usually be done by a gynaecologist.
This is usually done by punching a small hole in the skin of the vulva and removing a small piece of skin. Local anaesthetic cream or injection is used to numb the skin first so that it doesn't hurt. The sample of skin is then examined in a laboratory.
Itchy vulva treatments
Treatments for an itchy vulva (pruritus vulvae) and vaginal itching vary, depending on the cause. For example:
Avoid irritants. Identifying and stopping the use of anything that may be sensitising the vulval skin.

Young girls should be encouraged to wipe gently from front to back, and to wash and rinse well and dry even when showering (when the vulva can be missed or left soapy).

Vaginal moisturisers and lubricants can also be very helpful, especially if the itch is on the inside as well as the outside.
Occasionally, some people become sensitised to various ingredients that are in some emollients. This can make an itch worse. However this is unusual and, in most people, bland moisturisers without added perfumes do help to reduce symptoms.
Aqueous cream is best used simply as a soap substitute and not as a moisturiser. Other emollients can be used for both.
Try to avoid the itch-scratch cycle
The itch-scratch cycle occurs when scratching causes more itching - which causes more scratching - which causes more itching - etc.
Scratching may make the itch worse.

General vulval skin care and other advice
The following may also help ease an itchy vulva, whatever the cause.
Clothes
Wear loose fitting, 100% cotton underwear. Avoiding nylon or synthetic underwear material which tends to block fresh air and causes increased sweating.

Avoiding wearing tight-fitting clothes such as cycling shorts or leggings. Skirts and dresses are probably better than trousers. Stockings are probably better than tights. The aim is to allow some air to get to the vulva, and not to allow it to become too sweaty.

Washing
The vulva should be washed gently, once a day. It is best to avoid using a sponge or flannel to wash with. Over-cleaning often makes symptoms worse. Using a bland, unscented moisturiser as a soap substitute can help as using water alone may dry out the skin and make symptoms worse.

It is best to avoid putting on underwear until the vulva is fully dry. The skin can be dried gently by dabbing it with a soft towel but a hairdryer - on a cool setting and held well away from the skin - may be useful to dry properly.

Other general advice
Sometimes soaps, perfumes, bubble baths, deodorants, scented creams, the dye in toilet tissue, etc can irritate (sensitise) the delicate vulval skin - these should not be used in bathwater or the shower. Plain, non-coloured toilet tissue. Non-perfumed sanitary towels and panty liners should be used when necessary but it is best to avoid using them on a regular basis. Plasticised 'one-way' top sheets on sanitary products can cause sweating and reduce air circulation and therefore may make an itchy vulva worse.

Is there anything that can help me sleep?
An antihistamine medicine at bedtime may help if sleep is affected by vulval or vaginal itching.
What is the outlook for an itchy vulva?
Most of the time, when a cause can be found, the cause is treated and the itch improves. However, depending on the cause, treatment is sometimes prolonged or may need to be repeated.
What if no cause for my itchy vulva is found?
In most cases, a cause can be found for an itchy vulva (pruritus vulvae). Treatment is then aimed at dealing with the underlying cause. However, in some cases no cause can be found. The general advice on clothes, washing, etc will usually help.
Topical oestrogen may help and is usually safe to try.
A mild steroid ointment such as hydrocortisone may be advised for a week or so. This often settles the itch within a few days and may also help to break any itch-scratch cycle that has developed.
However, steroid ointment should not be used regularly on the vulva, unless medically advised for a condition such as lichen sclerosus, as it can have a thinning effect on the skin with long-term use.

Possible long-term problems of polycystic ovary syndrome
Women's health
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a health condition that affects some women from their late teens onwards. Though PCOS is sometimes managed with medicine, its symptoms can be reduced through a combination of healthy lifestyle habits - especially your diet.
by Victoria Raw
Women's health
Premature ovarian insufficiency is sometimes called premature ovarian failure. The condition occurs when your ovaries no longer work properly when you are under the age of 40 years. Your ovaries no longer produce normal amounts of oestrogen and therefore may not produce eggs. This means that your periods stop (or become irregular) and you may experience symptoms of the menopause. In the majority of women, this occurs around the age of 51 years and is called the menopause. The term early menopause is usually used if you go through the menopause when you are between 40 and 45 years of age. With premature ovarian insufficiency your ovaries are not working properly and have stopped producing eggs early. In some women, however, this loss of function is temporary and their ovaries work and function again in the future. This means that you may find that your periods return at some stage in the future. Therefore premature ovarian insufficiency is not necessarily the same as premature menopause, which means the irreversible loss of ovarian function before the age of 40 years. Around 4 in 100 women under the age of 40 years have premature ovarian insufficiency. About 4 in 100 women have premature menopause.

What is PCOS?
Polycystic ovaries
What is PCOS?
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition which has previously been thought to be gynaecological (associated with women's reproductive health), but is now understood to be mainly metabolic (associated with the way that the body handles insulin and other hormones).
Genetic factors and obesity cause insulin resistance (changes in the way that the organs in the body respond to the hormone insulin) - this increases the levels of insulin in the body, which causes the following changes in the female hormones:
Overproduction of luteinising hormone (LH) prevents the rapid increase in LH mid-way through the menstrual cycle, which is necessary for ovulation. This means that an egg is not made every month, causing a reduction in fertility.
Overproduction of luteinising hormone (LH) prevents the rapid increase in LH mid-way through the menstrual cycle, which is necessary for ovulation. This means that an egg is not made every month, causing a reduction in fertility.
The increase in LH causes the ovaries to preferentially make testosterone (the male hormone) rather than oestrogen (the female hormone).

Hormone changes stop eggs from fully developing in the ovary and therefore reduce ovulation (making an egg each month).
Hormone changes stop eggs from fully developing in the ovary and therefore reduce ovulation (making an egg each month).
How common is PCOS?
PCOS is common. It is difficult to know exactly how common, as figures vary depending on the definitions used and the countries studied.
Research studies of women who had an ultrasound scan of their ovaries found that up to a third of young women have polycystic ovaries (ie ovaries with many small cysts). However, many of these women were healthy, ovulated normally and did not have high levels of male chemicals (hormones). Having polycystic ovaries does not mean that you have polycystic ovary syndrome.
It is thought that around 1 in 10 women have PCOS (at least two of: polycystic ovaries, raised male hormone levels, reduced ovulation). However, the true figure may be higher, possibly up to 1 in 4 women, because some women with mild symptoms do not seek any assessment or treatment.
See the separate feature 8 common myths about PCOS for more details.
PCOS symptoms
Period problems occur in about 7 in 10 women with PCOS. You may have irregular or light periods, or no periods at all.

Depression or poor self-esteem may develop as a result of the other symptoms.
Symptoms typically begin in the late teens or early 20s. Not all symptoms occur in all women with PCOS. For example, some women with PCOS have some excess hair growth but have normal periods and fertility. Some may have irregular periods or no periods, but have no other symptoms.
Symptoms of PCOS can vary from mild to severe. For example, mild unwanted hair is normal, and it can be difficult to say when it becomes abnormal in women with mild PCOS. At the other extreme, women with severe PCOS can have marked hair growth, infertility and obesity.
Symptoms may also change over the years. For example, acne may become less of a problem in middle age but hair growth may become more noticeable.
What causes PCOS?
The cause of PCOS as far as we understand it is explained in the section 'What causes PCOS'. It is a condition that isn't yet fully understood. PCOS does not have a clear pattern of inheritance as is the case for some other conditions, but it may run in families.
Whilst many women with PCOS have obesity, this is not the case for everyone, and some may have insulin resistance without having obesity. However, it is definitely the case that for anyone with PCOS who also has obesity, losing weight will be beneficial and may make ovulation more likely.
Are any tests needed to diagnose PCOS?
Tests may be advised to clarify the diagnosis and to rule out other hormone conditions.
Blood tests may be taken to measure certain chemicals (hormones). For example, a test to measure the male hormone testosterone and luteinising hormone (LH) which tend to be high in women with PCOS.

An ultrasound scan of the ovaries may be advised. An ultrasound scan is a painless test that uses sound waves to create images of structures in the body. The scan can detect the typical appearance of PCOS with the many small cysts (follicles) in slightly enlarged ovaries.

Screening for diabetes or non-diabetic hyperglycaemia (NDH, also known as pre-diabetes)
You may be advised to have an annual screening test for diabetes or non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, also known as pre-diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. A regular check for other cardiovascular (heart disease) risk factors such as blood pressure and blood cholesterol, may be advised to detect any abnormalities as early as possible.
Exactly when and how often the checks are done depends on your age, your weight and other factors. After the age of 40, these tests are usually recommended every five years, or more often if an abnormality is found.
PCOS treatment
There is no cure for PCOS. However, symptoms can be treated and your health risks can be reduced.
Losing weight and taking exercise
Losing weight helps to reduce the high insulin level that occurs in PCOS. This has a knock-on effect of reversing some of the hormone changes associated with PCOS, and improving the chance of you ovulating. Periods will then be more likely to be regular and fertility will improve. Hair growth and acne may also resolve or improve and the increased risks of long-term problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, etc, are reduced.
Losing weight can be difficult. Whilst it would seem obvious that 'eat less and move more' will result in weight loss, obesity is more complex than that, involving long-term changes in the hormones which affect hunger and the feeling of fullness. Exercise has also been shown to help with PCOS, probably by increasing sensitivity to insulin.
Advice from a dietician may increase your chance of losing weight, or you could be referred to a weight loss clinic for consideration of medication (such as orlistat or injections of medications known as GLP1 agonists) or surgery to help with weight loss. Access to these clinics on the NHS varies significantly by area.
Even a moderate amount of weight loss can help - losing 10% of your body weight has a significant chance of helping you to ovulate and so increasing your fertility.
The best foods for someone with PCOS to eat are likely to be those which are slowly absorbed keeping blood sugar levels steady. These are said to have a low glycaemic index (low GI).
This means avoiding white bread, pasta and rice, and choosing wholemeal alternatives, or avoiding bread, pasta and rice entirely Potatoes and sugary foods and drinks are also best avoided. Most fruit, vegetables, pulses and wholegrain foods are both healthy and have a low GI.
Treating hair growth
Hair growth is due to the increased level of the hormone testosterone. Unwanted hair can be removed by:
Shaving.

Waxing.

Hair-removing creams.

Electrolysis.
Electrolysis.
Laser treatments.
Laser treatments.
These need repeating every now and then, although electrolysis and laser treatments may be more long-lasting (but are expensive and are often not available on the NHS).
There are also some medicines which may be helpful. A cream called eflornithine may be prescribed for removing unwanted facial hair. It works by counteracting a chemical (an enzyme) involved in making hair in the skin. Some research trials suggest that it can reduce unwanted hair growth, although this effect quickly wears off after stopping treatment.
Medicines taken by mouth can also treat hair growth. They work by reducing the amount of testosterone that you make, or by blocking its effect. Medicines used include:
Cyproterone acetate - an anti-testosterone medicine. This is commonly combined with oestrogen as a special oral contraceptive pill called Dianette®. Dianette® is commonly prescribed to regulate periods, to help reduce hair growth, to reduce acne and as a good contraceptive.

Other anti-testosterone medicines are sometimes advised by a specialist if the above treatments do not help.
All types of combined oral contraceptive pill, including Dianette and Yasmin, increase the risks of blood clots in the veins - they are unlikely to be suitable if your body mass index (BMI) is greater than 35, as the risk of blood clots will be considered to be too high. If your BMI is greater than 30 and you have other risk factors for blood clots then again this class of medicine may not be suitable for you.
Dianette and Yasmin were the first brands of these particular pills available in the UK, but other brands are now available - your GP may prescribe generically (using the names of the hormones rather than the brand) and so the brand that you are given may vary with each prescription. This is helpful if there are shortages of a particular brand as your pharmacist can just dispense a different one rather than going back to the GP for a new prescription.
Medicines taken by mouth to treat hair growth take 3-9 months to work fully. You need then to carry on taking them, otherwise hair growth will come back (recur). Removing hair by the methods above (shaving, etc) may be advised whilst waiting for a medicine to work.
Treating acne
The treatments used for acne in women with PCOS are no different to the usual treatments for acne. The combined oral contraceptive pills, especially Dianette®, often help to improve acne. See the separate leaflets called Acne and Acne treatments which covers topical treatments and antibiotic tablet treatment for acne.
Treating period problems
Some women who have no periods, or have infrequent periods, do not want any treatment for this. However, your risk of developing endometrial cancer (cancer of the womb/uterus) may be increased if you have no periods for a long time. Regular periods will prevent this possible increased risk to the uterus.
Therefore, some women with PCOS are advised to take the contraceptive pill, as it causes regular withdrawal bleeds similar to periods. If this is not suitable, another option is to take a progestogen hormone, such as medroxyprogesterone for several days every few months.
This will cause a monthly bleed like a period. Sometimes, a levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG-IUD), previously known as the intrauterine system (IUS), which releases small amounts of progestogen into the womb, preventing a build-up of the lining, can be used. If none of these methods is suitable, your specialist may arrange a regular ultrasound scan of your uterus to detect any problems early - this is not commonly done.
Fertility issues
Although fertility is often reduced, you still need contraception if you want to be sure of not getting pregnant. The chance of becoming pregnant depends on how often you ovulate. Some women with PCOS ovulate now and then, others not at all.
If you do not ovulate but want to become pregnant then fertility treatments may be recommended by a specialist and have a good chance of success. Tablets such as clomifene can cause you to ovulate.
But remember, you are much less likely to become pregnant if you have obesity. If you have obesity or overweight, losing weight is advised in addition to other fertility treatments; in many areas, fertility treatment is only offered under a certain BMI.
Metformin and other insulin-sensitising medicines
Metformin is a medicine that is commonly used to treat people with type 2 diabetes. It makes the body's cells more sensitive to insulin. This may result in a decrease in the blood level of insulin which may help to counteract the underlying cause of PCOS - see above.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), in its clinical knowledge summary page, advises that metformin only be started after a specialist opinion for those with PCOS. However, in its guideline on reducing the risk of diabetes, NICE advises that metformin be considered for people whose blood sugar has got worse despite intensive lifestyle change, or if they cannot take part in intensive lifestyle change, particularly if their BMI is greater than 35. The PCOS guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says similar.
You might want to talk to your doctor if this applies to you. The European guidelines on PCOS say that metformin 'should be considered' in adults with PCOS and a BMI of 25 or more, if the decision to take it is shared between the doctor and the patient, but this it not currently common practice in the UK.
Possible long-term problems of polycystic ovary syndrome
If you have PCOS, over time you have an increased risk of:
Developing type 2 diabetes.

Being overweight, particularly around the tummy.
Being overweight, particularly around the tummy.
These problems in turn may also increase your risk of having a stroke and heart disease in later life. These increased health risks are due to the long-term insulin resistance.
A sleeping problem called sleep apnoea is also more common than average in women with PCOS.
Other possible problems in pregnancy include more chance of having premature babies or having high blood pressure in pregnancy (pre-eclampsia). There may be twice the risk of developing diabetes in pregnancy if you have PCOS so you would be checked for this regularly.
If you have no periods, or very infrequent periods, you may have a higher-than-average risk of developing cancer of the womb (uterus). However, the evidence for this is not conclusive and, if there is a risk, it is probably small and can be prevented.
Preventing long-term problems
A healthy lifestyle is important to help prevent the conditions listed above in 'Possible long-term problems of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)'. For example, you should:
Eat a healthy diet.

Exercise regularly.

Not smoke.

Healthy lifestyle advice applies to everyone, whether they have PCOS or not. However, it is particularly important for women with PCOS, as they may have extra risk factors for health problems in later life. These risks are much reduced if you are not overweight and do not smoke.
Dr Hazell has an interest in women's health and has been involved in writing and reviewing educational materials on PCOS for a variety of organisations, including, but not limited to, the RCGP, the PCWHF and Cambridge University Press.

Premature ovarian insufficiency
The menopause is the time when your ovaries stop working to make an egg each month - it occurs 12 months after your last period. The perimenopause is the time when your periods are getting less regular and you are said to be in the postmenopause when your last period was more than 12 months ago, and this is not due to your periods stopping for another reason such as the use of a contraceptive that stops your periods.

Menopause is a natural part of ageing that happens when oestrogen levels drop, but it can be a challenging time. Officially defined as the time when your periods stop, the menopause - and the stage leading up to it - can cause various physical and mental symptoms, such as anxiety.
by Victoria Raw
Women's health
Perimenopause refers to the transitional phase that occurs before menopause. It typically begins several years before menopause, although the exact duration can vary from woman to woman. During perimenopause, a woman's body undergoes hormonal changes as the ovaries start producing less oestrogen. Symptoms include hot flushes, night sweating, mood changes, vaginal dryness, and changes in libido.
by Dr Hayley Willacy, FRCGP
What is menopause?
A natural menopause occurs because as you age your ovaries stop producing eggs and making oestrogen (the main female hormone). This represents the move from the time in your life when you can have children (the reproductive years) to the time when you can no longer conceive. The fall in oestrogen levels can cause various symptoms, discussed later in the leaflet.
What age does the menopause happen?
The average age of the menopause in the UK is 51. Your menopause is said to be early if it occurs before the age of 45.
Menopause symptoms
The menopause is a natural event. Every woman will go through it at some point. You may have no problems; however, it is common to develop one or more menopause symptoms which are due to the dropping level of oestrogen. About 8 out of 10 women will develop menopausal symptoms at some point. Around a quarter of women have very severe symptoms.
Hot flushes
These will occur in about 3 in 4 women. A typical hot flush (or flash) lasts a few minutes and causes flushing of your face, neck and chest. You may also sweat (perspire) during a hot flush.
Some women become giddy, weak, or feel sick during a hot flush. Some women also develop a 'thumping heart' sensation (palpitations) and sudden feelings of anxiety during the episode.
The number of hot flushes can vary from every now and then, to fifteen or more a day. Hot flushes tend to start just before the menopause and can persist for several years.
Sweats
This commonly occurs when you are in bed at night. In some cases they are so severe that sleep is disturbed and you need to change your bedding and nightclothes.
Other symptoms

Changes to your periods
The time between periods may shorten in some women around the menopause; in others, periods may become further apart, perhaps many months apart.
See the separate article called How menopause can affect you at work.
How long do symptoms last?
Menopause symptoms may only last a few months in some women. However, for others symptoms can continue for several years. Some women may have early menopause symptoms that start months or years before their periods stop (peri-menopausal symptoms).
More than half of women have symptoms for more than seven years.
What causes early menopause?
There are certain things such as some medical conditions that may cause an early menopause - for example:
If you have surgery to remove your ovaries for some reason, you are likely to develop menopausal symptoms straightaway.

If you have had your womb (uterus) removed (hysterectomy) before your menopause, your ovaries will still make oestrogen. However, it is likely that the level of oestrogen will fall at an earlier age than average. As you do not have periods after a hysterectomy, it may not be clear when you are in 'the menopause'. However, you may develop some typical symptoms (see below) when your level of oestrogen falls.

If your menopause occurs before you are 40, it is due to premature ovarian insufficiency (also known as primary ovarian insufficiency). Read more about premature ovarian insufficiency.
How does menopause affect your body?
Following the menopausal transition, a woman's body may change in several ways:
Skin and hair
You tend to lose some skin protein (collagen) after the menopause. This can make your skin drier, thinner and more likely to itch. See our feature on How to manage skin problems at menopause.
Genital area
Lack of oestrogen tends to cause the tissues in and around your vagina to become thinner and drier. Learn more about vaginal dryness (atrophic vaginitis), also known as genitourinary syndrome of the menopause (GSM). These changes can develop months or years after menopause:
Your vagina may shrink a little and expand less easily during sex. You may experience some pain when you have sex.

Your vulva (the skin next to your vagina) may become thin, dry and itchy.

You may notice that you need to pass urine more frequently and may even leak.

'Thinning' of the bones (osteoporosis)
As you become older, you gradually lose bone tissue. Your bones become less dense and less strong. The amount of bone loss can vary. If you have a lot of bone loss then you may develop osteoporosis.
If you have osteoporosis, you have bones that will break (fracture) more easily than normal, especially if you have an injury such as a fall. Women lose bone tissue more rapidly than men lose it, especially after the menopause when the level of oestrogen falls. Oestrogen helps to protect against bone loss.
Cardiovascular disease (heart disease)
Your risk of disease of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), including heart disease and stroke, increases after the menopause. Again, this is because the protective effect of oestrogen is lost.
Oestrogen is thought to help protect your blood vessels against atheroma. In atheroma, small fatty lumps develop within the inside lining of blood vessels. Atheroma is involved in the development of heart disease and stroke. You can reduce this risk by looking at other risk factors - don't smoke, stay at a healthy weight and eat a healthy diet.
Is there a test for menopause?
Hormone blood tests
Your doctor can usually diagnose the menopause by your typical symptoms. Hormone blood tests (hormone levels) are not needed to confirm that you are going through the menopause. However, they may be helpful in some cases - for example, in women aged under 40 years if a premature menopause is suspected. The test done in primary care is usually follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) which is raised in the menopause. Anti-Müllerian hormone is not tested for the diagnosis of the menopause and is mainly used in secondary care fertility clinics; GPs cannot usually request this blood test.
Other blood tests or scans may be undertaken in some women, but these are generally to look for other causes of symptoms rather than to diagnose the menopause.
It is important that you keep up to date with the national cervical screening programme and breast cancer screening programme, if you are in the age ranges for these programmes.
Menopause treatment
Without treatment, the symptoms discussed above last for several years in most women.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
HRT is a very effective treatment for the symptoms of the menopause. It replaces the oestrogen hormone that your ovaries stop making once you are menopausal. It has benefits and risks. Find out more about hormone replacement therapy (HRT).
If your main symptoms are in your vagina and genital area or if you are getting urinary incontinence symptoms, you are likely to benefit from using treatment that is inserted into your vagina or just applied to your genital area as a cream or used inside the vagina as a ring. Read about treatment for vaginal dryness and urinary symptoms. This vaginal HRT can be used alone, or with systemic HRT that is taken as a patch, spray, gel or tablet.
Systemic HRT is available as:
Tablets.
Tablets.
Skin patches.
Skin patches.
Gels to apply to the skin.
Gels to apply to the skin.
Sprays.
Sprays.
There are several brands for each of these types of HRT. All deliver a set dose of oestrogen (with or without progestogen) into your bloodstream.
HRT alternatives
There are treatments other than HRT for menopausal symptoms. As a rule, they are not as effective as HRT but may help relieve some symptoms. See the separate leaflet called Alternatives to HRT for menopause symptoms.
See our feature on How to make the menopause a little easier.
Can you get pregnant after the menopause?
Although women become less fertile as they get older, it is still possible to get pregnant around the time of the menopause. So, if you are sexually active and don't want to become pregnant, you will need to consider contraception:
Until a year after your last period if you are 50 or over.
Until a year after your last period if you are 50 or over.
Until two years after your last period if you are under 50.
Until two years after your last period if you are under 50.
Assessing when to stop contraception is more difficult if your periods have stopped due to your current contraception. For example, the implant, the hormone coil and some pills can cause your periods to stop.
If this applies to you then you have two choices. You can either continue contraception until the age of 55 (at which time all women can stop), though you may need to change the type of contraception at age 50. Or you can have a blood test at the age of 50 - if this shows that you are in the menopausal range then you can stop your contraception one year after the blood test.
See the separate leaflet called Contraception for women over 40.
