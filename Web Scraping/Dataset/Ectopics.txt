Hi am new to this site. i have been having ectopic heart beats, had ecgs and ecg monitor for 24 hrs . Which discovered ventricular and atrial ectopics. Arrthythmia nurse said they are benign and not to worry. Easy said than done. i get them daily , and it really occupies your mind. ive been having them since my 40s and now 60 so you would think get a grip. Its very hard somtimes. Any answers welcome . thank you

There are no answers except to be busy with your brain and mind positively unthink them. If i get down . There they are. We do make them ourselves to some extent. Hate them and do something positive. Even go for a wet walk,a trip into town,something that takes time and listen to a podcast. a funny one or a life lesson. There are LOTS of us
