I am a 52 year old woman. I started having missed heart beats, fast heart beats last July. I also get episodes of chest tightness, through to my back, neck and dizzyness at times. I never get the missed beats and tightness together. I attended my GP last August for something else, thankfully my heart was all over the place. He said i had an irregular heartbeat that i had to go straight to A&E. Unfortunately, by the time I was seen my heart went back to normal. I also ended up with really bad chest pain, etc at work in November for which an ambulance had to be called. I have had bloods, ECG, 24hr ECG and two weeks of using the Kardia ECG. Report from hospital came back that I have extra beats, but no concerns, no further investigation needed. My question is, do I accept this report because some people have asked why I have not had any more tests as these episodes etc still happen. Someone mentioned angina. Can I ask if anyone on here has the same symptoms which resulted in their diagnosis of angina?
