Hi everyone. I have a loop recorder to monitor my minimal svt. i’ve only developed that this year. But it’s really only 10 seconds or less every month or so. What I have been getting our atrial ectopics. Sometimes it’s a few thousand a day and sometimes it’s none but today I’m having between 20 to 30 a minute. My nurse practitioner said that even though it feels like a lot it’s not dangerous. I’m very symptomatic, I know some people walk around with a lot and don’t feel anything, but I do. Im thinking about a beta blocker but I already have low bp so idk Does anyone have experience with so many thousands a day?

hi
i suffer from both pvc’s and pac’s every day. some days are easier, but some days are much much worse this summer has been terrible and sometimes every other beat is a pvc/pac (can’t tell which ones, but have had of them both while wearing a monitor).
today for example i tried to count these but i quit at 1000 …feels like they are here to stay
so yeah..you’re not alone.

Jesse, I know you posted 3 months ago but I’ve just joined. have you had any answers? I have 25% burden of PACs and am worried. Magnesium has been suggested and if that doesn’t help then Flecainide which terrifies me. how are you?
