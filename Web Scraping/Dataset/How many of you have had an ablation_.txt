I was having 4000 PVCs a day about 4 years ago. My electrophysiologist said he would do an ablation. I was symptomatic like everyone here and decided to do it. I was still having a few here and there but no big deal. Then, several months ago I started feeling them come back with a vengence and went back to the cardiologist thinking they had come back and had echo again and Holter monitor. It turns out I was only having 40 PVCs a day and the new issue was PACs, which feel pretty much the same to me. I have never really had PACs before that I know of so I find it odd I’m having almost the exact same amount that I had of the PVCs a few years ago. I’m more afraid of these than I was the PVCs. I’m so worried it will turn into a more serious abnormal rhythm. He told me they don’t really do ablations for PACs but didn’t really tell me why. If I could get one I absolutely would. I can’t stand living like this again. I thought I was over all of this just to have it come back as something else now. Ugh! I’m afraid, like others here, to do much of anything. I can feel several in a row a lot of the time. It’s just insane.
Have any of you had an ablation and had them come back or get a new kind of abnormal rhythm?
