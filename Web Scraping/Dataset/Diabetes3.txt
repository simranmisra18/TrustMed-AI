What is diabetes type 1?
Type 1 diabetes, usually diagnosed in children and young adults, can occur at any age when the pancreas does not produce insulin, a hormone needed to control the body's blood sugar levels. It requires daily monitoring of blood sugar, insulin therapy, diet modification and exercise.

What is gestational diabetes mellitus?
Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that is first seen in a pregnant woman who did not have diabetes before she was pregnant. For most women with gestational diabetes, the diabetes goes away soon after delivery. When it does not go away, the diabetes is called type 2 diabetes.

15 years doing 1500cal Insulin Resistant diet. Now: 2 eggs, 4 bars, 3 salads daily
Back in 2005, after a year of experimenting with an Insulin Resistant diet I posted this question: Does an "Insulin Resistance" diet improve blood pressure? Link: https://www.healthboards.com/boards/high-low-blood-pressure/242229-does-insulin-resistance-diet-improve-blood-pressure.html

Back then, I had almost no knowledge of Insulin Resistance or Diabetes. I only knew that my blood pressure was dangerously high ALL THE TIME! I did not realize the link between blood sugar metabolism and high blood pressure.

Now after 15 years of not taking any diabetes medications, such as Metformin, and religiously adhering to a strict, 6 small meal, low calorie, low carb diet, year after year after year, at 75 years of age, my health has significantly improved, my blood pressure reading are always at healthy levels all day and night, and my blood sugar is also at very good levels, either fasting, or two hours after eating.

I didn't recover overnight. My recovery was very slow and gradual. Very slow! Year after year, month after month my health improved. Just wanted to pass on my experience with the powerful curative powers of a healthy, small meal, low calorie, low carb diet.

Diabetes Calculating Chart


This chart is used to show how your blood sugar numbers reflect to your A1c.

I see many folks asking the question of what do their BS numbers mean. This shows how your BS numbers would calculate to your A1c. I asked HealthBoards if I could post it and was told yes. Hopefully this is a useful tool especially to newbies.

http://www.diabeteschart.org/bloodsugarchart.html

This is preapproved by Administrator.

BTW...to the right of the website is a place you can sign a guestbook, join or contact them and I would strongly suggest if you use any, do not use your real name. To me, that is how you can get spam. This chart was posted for people to just be able to see what their numbers mean...Thanks...JJ

Is a glucose tolerance test indicated for a pre-diabetic?
My cardiologist had blood work done on me last week. My fasting glucose was 118 and my A1c was 5.7. I asked if a glucose tolerance test would be of any use. He said he couldn't order it, I'd have to get that from my PCP. I emailed her the results and she said the only thing she'd recommend was to start a GLP1 regimen. I looked up GLP1 and am concerned about bad side effects, but my main question is why both doctors shied away from the GTT.


Dexcom and Smart Watch
I'm using Dexcom G7 using there receiver. and I've been thinking about getting a android watch to check glucose levels. Is anyone using a smart watch and if so do you like it? What brand do you have. I don't know much about this.

Monthly Cost of Insulin
Yesterday I was in an informal discussion at our senior living complex when one participant complained about the high price she was paying for insulin.

I was surprised, as the Inflation Reduction Act caps the monthly cost of insulin for Medicare patients at $35, and Eli Lilly, the largest US provider of insulin, reduced its insulin price by 70% to match that $35 cost, as I understand the news releases.

I'm curious whether patients are now actually paying no more than $35 for a month's supply of insulin in the US.

understanding meter compared with A1c
Hello everyone

I need some help understanding my meter readings, my average blood sugar over the last 3 months was 122 but my A1c came back as 6.3 which doesn't seem to correlate, if I look at the A1c charts an average reading of 122 is 5.9 A1c, any insight to this would be appreciated.

Thx

Thoughts on these numbers?
My last A1C was 2 years ago and it was 4.7. However, since then I have been gaining some weight. Working on losing it.

A few weeks ago I was at the doctors (wasn’t feeling well) and she checked my blood sugar. It was 151. This was 2 - 3 hours or so after eating a big breakfast burrito but I was also stressed out, fast heart rate, etc. She ordered a blood test which I got a few hours later and it was 111. She did not check my a1c at that time since I have an upcoming physical.

I am at a friends house who has a glucose monitor today and after telling him my story we checked it. The last time I had anything to eat was 2 hours prior. It was 96. Granted I worked out this morning and went for a long run.

I then drank half a glass of lemonade and had half a bagel with cream cheese and he offered to take it 30 minutes later - the first reading was 122 and the second right after was 129.

He said we could take it again 2 hours from now but I’ll be gone by then.

I know random blood sugar tests aren’t science and there’s a lot that goes into diabetes in general. My mom got it in her 30s and I am 39 so I’m trying to stave it off as long as I can.

My next physical isn’t until June and I’ll get my a1c checked then. But curious on what people think of these numbers. Should I buy a meter and keep randomly testing to see if I get anymore 151 readings?

Postprandial Adrenergic Syndrome Very strange symptoms ,been healthy my whole life.
I have some new data. I feel I've found something that I researched that more or less fits the description of what is happening to me but still no solutions. Im hoping someone on here can lead me to freedom of this horrible feelings I get after eating, its keeping from a functioning normal life. The residual feeling just doesn't really go away. Something called Postprandial Adrenergic Syndrome. Its like a fake hypoglycemia BUT happens after eating food. Your hormones go wacky adrenaline spikes to make you feel like you have anxiety for no reason. Shaky, confusion , dizzy , lightheaded all kinds of weird BP and heart rate stuff, etc. But blood glycose readings are in always in normal range. Help.


Very strange symptoms ,been healthy my whole life then this happned.
I was using the general message board and a nice fellow was answering some of my questions. He felt it sounded like insulin resistance problem that may be occurring with me. Though I asked him even when I was borrowing a neighbors glucose reader and the numbers looked fine all the time.
He said to reach out over here for more expert advise.

So this is what is happening, Im going to copy and paste something I saved on email if I ever get to a badly needed doctor to show them.

Started Dec 11th at about 3 am. Got up to use bathroom, dizzy off balance. Througout the period I was lightheaded feelings of going to faint. Felt high blood pressure and heart rate, shaking sweating, panic feeling. I felt if I laid down I was going to die so I started walking for miles till the sun came up and came home fell asleep sitting up. For 3 days I laid mostly in bed dizzy feeling. on the 3rd day I decided to drink alot of water ( which I hadn't been) and this seemed to help a lot. After the few days I felt 100 % again. Went to the gym, long bike rides, etc. felt good.

3 weeks later it recurred after eating, dizzy shaking, high blood pressure ,heart rate, high anxiety, confusion . After this time I was not feeling normal going ahead. It has happened numerous times now but oddly can skip days and though I still feel lightheaded through out the day but not as much until it happens again after I eat, only happens after I eat, I'm afraid to eat, losing weight quickly. Lately I can not function and have been bed ridden or mostly just weak feeling and lightheadedness.
Headaches in different areas of head, some in front some in back of head ( I never have headaches.)

Dizzy, light headed, off balance
Lower lip becomes numb.
Tingling in hands, feet become cold.
confussion.


Ear infection that I've had since summer.

Blood pressure and heart rate skyrocket sometimes, other times normal or lower than normal.

Face flushing.
Shaking uncontrollable
Anxiety,
Weakness

Fever sometimes
Chills sometimes
right side pain down near ribcage.

Prior to all this I gave blood 2 times once in Oct and Dec after the second time I did not feel right. I see they took blood when iron was still low. Also I have had an Ear infection that I've had since summer.

Fast forward this week, for the majority of the week its not happend, very very weird. Please advise , thank you.


Fiber one whole wheat buns
Hello
Has anyone tried the Fiber one 100% whole wheat buns?
If so how was your blood sugar after it.

Last night I had a salmon portion with some summer slaw and afterwards toasted the fiber one bun and added whipped cream cheese.

2 hrs later I tested and my BS was 168, I was surprised as I thought the fiber and it being 100% whole wheat it would have been lower.

Thx
My blood sugar tests are always at healthy levels. Am I no longer a diabetic?
I have never taken any medication for diabetes or insulin resistance. I eat six low carb meals which consists of four romaine, broccoli and cheese salads (with one tablespoon of home made honey mustard dressing); two eggs; four protein bars and tons of decaf coffee. My blood sugar levels are always at very nice levels and so it my health.

Once in a while I get rebellious and attempt something like another protein bar, or I substitute one of my protein bars with a higher sugar bar, or I'll take extra salad dressing, and my blood sugar levels rise to somewhat unhealthy levels, I'll have increased sweating and my heartbeat will become less stable. So... I just back it down to my normal diet, and voila, back to good blood sugar levels and reduced symptoms!

That said, it just shows that, after 16 years of dieting, without having to take any diabetic medications, I still have to greatly limit my carbs. My blood sugar levels are always at very healthy levels, but I have to still consider myself diabetic! It just seems odd, having healthy blood sugar levels, but still being a diabetic!

Never cured, but always controlled!

Why is this a big deal to me? Well... in 1987 I suffered from nasty, debilitating heart failure along with persistent AFib and Diabetes, all of which greatly improved through a diet targeting insulin resistance. I've wondered if my diabetic problems would eventually go away! Not yet!

Lower cost for test strips?
Where can I find a place to buy test strips at a better price than the usual list price? The strips I am using now are very expensive and I am soon to lose the insurance that covers them at a much lower cost, about 70%. I do know about other meters with lower costs but was hoping to find some for my meter.

Metformin XR
I am pre diabetic and my doctor wants to start me on Metformin XR. I've always heard bad stories about this drug but wondering what experience people have had with it here.. does it work for you or does it cause horrible stomach issues? Does it really help to lower your a1c without bad side effects?


Re: Metformin XR
Even identical twins could get different results from the same drug - any drug. Identical twins often die many years apart, and from different diseases. That's because everyone ages differently from different environmental experiences and/or exposures. So if no two people have exactly the same health status, that means taking a drug is always a gamble.

Ask your doctor if Metformin XR is a cure or if it only helps to manage blood sugar levels. It may be that you really need to make some adjustments to your diet.

Being that you are pre-diabetic, this is a good time to work on your diet before it gets worse.

Re: Metformin XR
Yeah I've been doing that with diet. She said it will control my blood sugar to prevent any kidney problems and hopefully prevent me from developing diabetes but she also said that some people have horrible side effects and some people don't. So I just thought I would come here and see what the consensus is on people that do take it. Obviously I know that I could react differently to anyone. But I just like to hear people's experiences.

How to quickly lower A1C in prediabetic
Just a question. How can I lower my A1C within the next month? My last A1C result was 6.4 so doc told me I am prediabetic. She is going to retest in 4 to 6 weeks and if still high...she wants to start me on metformin. I don't want to have full blown diabetes and I do not want to take metformin because of all the horror stories I have heard. Obviously I know I need to cut out carbs and sugar ..junk food and fast food but I don't think I can just quit completely 100% cold turkey today . I'm going to do my best to eliminate things from my diet within the next week or two and find other replacements that work. Besides cutting out carbs and sugar and increasing exercise, what else can I do to get this number down within the next few weeks? I know it's a lifestyle change and I'll need to continue but I'm trying to avoid getting put on medication. My biggest downfall is sweets. And I know fruit isn't always the answer. What are some good things that diabetics or pre-diabetics can eat for the sugar cravings? Also, I know an A1C is a calculation of a 3-month Time frame, so since my last test was about a month ago. I'm hoping starting diet changes now will make my number lower for my next test in another 6 weeks.



Re: How to quickly lower A1C in prediabetic
Hi, these are all great ways to start lowering your blood sugars. It really is a lifestyle change that needs effort, so its great you're starting to do that. You can always tell the dr your feelings that your not ready to start meds yet and want to keep trying to lower your blood sugar naturally. You do have a say in your treatment, but just make sure you follow through if you do this, because untreated diabetes is no joke.

They do have sugar free sweets, as an alternative, but frankly, fruit is better for you. Just eat 1 apple with some cheese to slow down the sugar absorption. Eat your fruit with a protein such as egg or cheese.
The other thing is, what causes diabetes in the body after further research isn't just simple carbohydrates and refined sugar. That contributes to it. I don't know how to exactly explain it, but simply put, the cells have to be able to receive the insulin, but if the cells are clogged with fat/plaque the insulin can't penetrate the cell wall, and so causes insulin resistance. in other words, fat in our diet is just as bad as sugar. So the combo of the two causes all kinds of problems. Not just diabetes, but causes stones to form in the body, other autoimmune diseases can develop, etc.
So the diabetes can be under more control with less carbs, but really we need to avoid the grease/plaque blocking the cell walls. The only way to do this is to really stop eating meat and go vegetarian for awhile. Drinking lots of water helps feel full and helps body to process toxins. There are other ways to get rid of the plaque (bbut that's another subject) it helps to lose weight, and then you start to see some of these diseases just seem to disappear.
This has been the experience I've had and some of my family has had. This is the best and long term way to keep yourself healthy. But, I understand about the cravings too. Just do what you can, start sooner than later, don't be hard on yourself if you slide backwards, and just keep trying and one day you'll find you are doing it.

Symptoms and normal test
Hello
Ive been having quite a lot of diabetes symptoms.

I had a fasting glucose test with results of 33mmol.

Is this normal? I've been looking online and it seems it could be too low?

Is that possible?

All advice welcome

Metformin question
Has anyone had insomnia on Metformin?

I’m newly diagnosed with Type ll and just started 500 mg ER
Questions anyone can post to...
2015 A1C was determined to be pre-diabetic, 2022 still not on any medicine because A1C still below 7. In the last few months, my feet have become unbearable. Gabapentin 3x's @ day with 2-500mg. every 4 hours. I feel like my feet are dying and going up into my ankles. Is this normal for others? My eyesight has gone down more this year too, anyone else feeling these symtons?

Questions to ask...
I'm going to start attending doctor appointments with my brother. He is 75, diagnosed with uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes, congestive heart failure, high cholesterol, and has had a stroke. He is on a blood thinner, meds for his other conditions and take Metformin for the diabetes. His last A1C was 8.2. He has a prescription for insulin but I don't know how much or even if he takes it. My impression is that he eats something sweet when his blood sugar is low and possibly ignores high readings. Cognitively he seems to fade out quite a bit and probably needs to be in a place where he can get daily care.

This is not a pretty picture and I understand he may not have much time left. What I am looking for is suggestions on what to ask the doctor to focus on while trying to shift him towards increased compliance. It may be a losing battle and it is ultimately his choice but I do have to put in an effort. I don't think it is realistic to improve all of his health issues but I think a priority should be trying to stabilize his blood sugar.

Any suggestions on simple steps I can suggest towards this goal?
I am 77, and I've had to deal with type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, heart failure and high cholesterol and chronically high blood pressure since 1987, but amazingly, I haven't had a stroke. All of those health issues are basically in my past.

I do about two hours of weight lifting, knee bending, stationary bike, power walking exercise each day and feel great!

The secret to my significant recovery has been diet! I went on a small meal, low glycemic carb, low calorie diet of around 6 meals since 2005. I started this diet Jan 2005, and was amazed at how fast my numbers came down to healthy levels and my health started to improve. A simple thing like a very healthy diet was the best "medication" and surprised the hell out of me! I totally ignored something as simple like that for many years!

The only medication I take is a tiny 6.25mg Coreg (Carvedilol).

I wish you luck with your brother and hope that he can get the help that he needs!

I had the courage to get a blood test (my last blood test was 14 years ago, im 34 years old). I'm terrified of needles and it was a traumatic experience for me getting blood out. That was the positive news. Unfortunately the bad news is that I have been diagnosed with prediabetes within the last few hours.

As I am unable to see my doctor due to COVID restrictions in my country, I came across this group in search of support groups and places I can learn more about this condition.

I quit drinking alcohol 5 months ago however I still smoke. I have been slightly overweight for 2 years but have packed on 4kg since being in COVID lockdown (gyms for instance are closed). I had been fairly active but I must admit, I have been eating a lot of junk food. Chocolate is my weakness.

I respectfully wanted to ask the following questions as I am extremely nervous with what lies ahead. If I have offended anyone, I genuinely apologise and do not intend to offend anyone.

Questions:
1/ Is it possible to get my sugar levels back to a normal level for good if I make some changes to my lifestyle? Or has the damage already been done?


****Answer/1. Yes. You can reverse course. Here is what I did. Stopped all sweets including,fruits and starches. This includes any of flour grain pasta, breads rice etc. When you get under prediabetic range easily with this.


2/ With a diagnosis of prediabetes, even if I get my sugar levels back to a normal level, does this mean that I can never eat chocolate again? If I were to eat a whole block (that is 180g) if I get back to a normal level, would I then go straight back into the prediabetes level?

****Answer/2. You should never go back to eating large or moderate deserts or candy at all! It will create cravings and you could put yourself back in a situation that could spiral out of control. You must control your portions and promise to not eat foods that create monster cravings. This is for your future health.


3/ Thinking about the long-term and if my condition does not improve and I get Type 2 Diabetes: If the answer is YES for question 1, is it also possible for someone with Type 2 Diabetes to get their sugar levels to a normal level too just as a diabetic can? If not, why not? Surely if you make changes to your lifestyle with Type 2 diabetes, you will also be able to get your sugar levels to a normal level and totally get rid of Diabetes? Or am I missing something here?


****Answer/3. All,you need to do is stop eating all junk carb ridden craving producing foods. It will take several months to overcome this. Your choice. Replace foods with fresh veggies in moderation as Well. The more you put food into your mouth no matter how healthy it will be harder. If you change yes your eating choices you will be back to normal in no time. But you cant ever go back. You will find yourself worse. If you do be strong and and responsible and get back with the healing program. And your new way of eatinf will be so much easier.


4/ If a person manages to reverse prediabetes, is it possible that they can live the rest of their life without developing Type 2 Diabetes? Or will it still inevitably cause Type 2 Diabetes?

****Answer/4. Yes, very possible people do this everyday. However you cant ever go back to your old way of eating. Remember this is about making life changing habits for LIFE not short term so you cant go back to eating junk and carb foods.


5/ I'm still coming to terms with my diagnosis. From my understanding, basically you can have no problems with blood sugars levels or if you do, you have the condition Type 2 Diabetes, right? In terms of prediabetes, do I or don't I have diabetes yet? Is there something wrong with my pancreas as a prediabetic or is my pancreas more like someone with no diabetes OR someone with diabetes? Is it correct in saying that prediabetes just a term used to say that our pancreas arent screwed yet AND to give us a warning that if we dont change our ways we will develop problems such as Diabetes?


****Answer/5. I dont know what condition your pancreas is in no one does. May e ask your doctor. But if you were in,bad shape Id hope he would have told you so. So dont worry about the pancreas. Just change your life time eating habits, add in exercise and drink plenty of water. And YES this is a warning sign for you. I vowed I would never be on insulin like my brother. And after 10 years Im still doing great and lost 30 pounds.

Ive found amino acid supplements worth really good for me and give me energy. Do,some research on L Tyrosine, L-phenylalanine and N Acetylcyeine known as NAC. This is about as much as I can give you.
So, do your own research. You can do it, your health is your choice and responsibility.

Lots of Luck


Sorry for the long questions. I really appreciate people going out of their time to answer these questions. I hope you are all safe and doing well.

Hi dyara!

I have never taken any medication for diabetes or insulin resistance. I eat five low carb meals which total two romaine, broccoli, carrots, tomatoes and cheese salads (with one tablespoon of home made honey mustard dressing); two eggs; three protein bars, about 3 tablespoons of chocolate ice cream (each meal) and tons of decaf coffee. My blood sugar levels are always at very nice levels and so is my health.

Once in a while I get rebellious and attempt something like another protein bar, or I substitute one of my protein bars with a higher sugar bar, or I'll take extra salad dressing, and my blood sugar levels rise to high normal, I'll have increased sweating and my heartbeat will become less stable. So... I just back it down to my normal diet, and voila, back to good blood sugar levels and reduced symptoms!

That said, it just shows that, after 17 years of dieting, without having to take any diabetic medications, I still have to greatly limit my carbs. My blood sugar levels are always at very healthy levels, but I have to still consider myself diabetic! It just seems odd, having healthy blood sugar levels, but still being a diabetic!

Never cured, but always controlled!

Why is this a big deal to me? Well... in 1987 I suffered from nasty, debilitating heart failure along with persistent AFib and Diabetes, all of which greatly improved through a diet targeting insulin resistance. I've wondered if my diabetic problems would eventually go away! Not yet!

Just wanted to give you some things to think about and to compare to!

Thanks for the replies pilly2 and Machaon. Very inspiring stories by the two of you - really enjoyed reading your responses.

Please correct me if I am wrong but I guess at the end of the day it doesn't matter whether you are Type 2 Diabetic or prediabetic, or in the normal blood sugar range - Healthy eating and regular exercise is important. Without trying to sound disrespectful, I guess for Type 2 Diabetics it is more important than say someone with normal blood sugar range to eat healthy. But in saying that, if a person with a normal blood sugar range begins to eat unhealthy over a long period of time, they too could find themselves to be a diabetic.

Furthermore, it seems like a healthy diet, regular exercise and ensuring your waist line minimizes are the unofficial cure to getting rid of Type 2 Diabetes and Prediabetes, right?

I've learnt more about fasting glucose levels and my Hba1c results. If I told you that I haven't exercised (except go for morning walks) whilst eating junk and fast food regularly and 180g of chocolate every 2 days, it didn't surprise me that I was in the prediabetes stage. However, given that these are the worst 3 months of my life in terms in inactivity and unhealthy eating, I would have thought my results to be worse than they are? How bad would you say my results actually are? What is a good Hba1c range to work towards?

Glucose Fasting: 5.8 mmol/L (3.6 – 6).
Insulin Fasting (Abbott Architect Method): 8 mU/L (0-20)
HbA1C (IFCC): 40 mmol / mol ( 20-38)
HbA1C (NGSP): 5.8% (4.0-5.6)

It seems that my fasting glucose levels seem to just fall within the normal range, however my Hba1c results were slightly over the normal range and into the prediabetes stage.


I was able to eat unhealthy for decades! I drank beer every day. I ate two chocolate candy bars daily. I ate plates of potato chips daily. For meals it was a half a large pizza, or a meatball and cheese sub, or a huge plate of spaghetti and meatballs. I could eat nonstop and never fill up! I was 5'9" and 180 pounds, which wasn't too bad, in my mind. My blood sugar was around 180, but I didn't feel too bad, so I ignored it.

But... as I approached age 50, my health deteriorated badly. I had to sit straight up to watch tv or to sleep. I couldn't recline at all or I wouldn't be able to breath. My heart would go nuts, beating fast and hard, or fast and weak, or very erratic. I felt so bad that I had to do something about my very poor diet. In other words, the pain got so bad that I had no other choice but to go on a very healthy diet!

I started a small meal, frequent eating (6-7 times per day), low glycemic carb "insulin resistant" diet of less than 1500 calories.

I learned that, over the years, I had caused my body to become diabetic and Insulin Resistant, damaging my pancreas. For a long time I consumed more carbs than my body could handle, causing my pancreas to overwork and weaken, producing more and more insulin, that was being rejected by my body.

The purpose for the small meals is so that it takes less effort and stress for my metabolism to handle the calories. The reason for the frequent eating is because I still had to consume a minimum of calories for each day.

Very slowly, over the years, my pancreas recovered, without having to take any medication. I would often try to eat more carbs, but either my blood sugar would get too high, or I would feel ill. But... over the years, I was able to consume more carbs.

So... even after decades of abuse, my pancreas and my metabolism have managed to become healthy again.

I really feel that Diabetes type two and it's kissing cousin, Insulin Resistance, can both be turned around through diet, and with exercise kicked in for good measure! The diet doesn't have to be as extreme as mine. Most working people or students can't eat 6-7 times per day and probably don't have to, just eat healthier!

If I could go back and enjoy eating unhealthy again, I would do so without question. But, I can't!

Hi there. Actually from my experience your A1c tells the story. So its not a horrid number but its not good either. Like the other person said youve got to control it by diet, exercise. And maybe even supplements. I know I got frustrated with it. Its a personal journey and struggles to gain back control. You are on the right track. Food choices are your number 1 beast youve got to conquer. You can do this.
Ive learned how to make chaffles which takes the place of bread for me. Finally ate a sandwich a couple years ago after I found out about them. Just use your search engine for the chaffle. Its simple fast and stores well. I also have hypothyroidism . When i decided not to let the doctors mess around with me on how much to medicate me. I did a ton of research. The amino acids have really helped me with cravings subsiding and excisive sweating. I take L -Tyrosine, L Phenyalamine along with N Acetylcysteine also known as NAC.

Not only was I successfully able to stop my thyroid meds my blood sugar stays between 95 and 110. No more excessive sweat, mu,ti trips at night to the bathroom or mood swings. So, you many want to look into these. Who knows it may help. I wish i had known about the amino acids before all my struggle. But, they play a big part in hormone conversion for the thyroid. And its all connected. I sleep a lot better at night too. I used to get up at least 5 times a night even on low carb and controlled food intake. Somewhere in my experience I have come to learn what helps me. Its taken a lot of research. But I am doing very well. Good luck with your journey.

Remember, take initiative to research instead of asking questions when you can use a search engine. Im saying asking a lot of questions will not give you a full understanding. Its like studying for an exam. And I found this out the hard way. You will discover you will understand better and one link will lead to another. If you are the kind of person that is a DIY person. I am. Many arent. Btw: i have never ran across anyone that connected the dots for thyroid, blood glucose with amino acids. I learned the difficult way. But now you know.


It seems (based on my research and please pull me up if I am wrong) that unfortunately for some, genetics is a too strong of a force for some and will really result in Type 2 Diabetes regardless of how much they exercise or what they do. For the rest, whether a T2 Diabetic, prediabetic or someone with normal sugar levels, diet and exercise are extremely important in helping to prevent T2 Diabetes.

If someone had T2 Diabetes and they were able to get their sugar levels to a normal level by exercising and eating healthy whilst maintaining a healthy body weight range. On the other side of the coin, a completely normal person who generally eats healthy, exercises and is within the healthy body weight range. If both of these people went on a holiday and had no choice but to eat a McDonalds Big Mac Meal, would the former Diabetic get a bigger sugar rise than the healthy person? In other words, would that meal alone put them back into the Diabetic range or would they need to go back to their previously unhealthy lifestyle for the T2 Diabetes to creep back up? I don't plan to return to my old ways, but just want to understand this condition better and secondly, be realistic - If I am away on a holiday and have no choice other than to eat something unhealthy or starve, I may need to eat unhealthy for a day or two before returning to eating healthy and exercising again. What long-term impact would this have on my blood sugar levels?



These were my results:

Glucose Fasting: 5.8 mmol/L (3.6 – 6). On the test, it says 3.6 – 6 is NORMAL.

Insulin Fasting (Abbott Architect Method): 8 mU/L (0-20). Apparently this is NORMAL too.

HbA1C (IFCC): 40 mmol / mol ( 20-38)
HbA1C (NGSP): 5.8% (4.0-5.6)

Here it seems as though I am SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL. Is 5.8mmol/L a terrible score to have?

It seems as though in my country a HbA1C score of 5.8% is indicative that I have pre-diabetes. However, I was looking on the internet and it seems that a British scientific organisation (Viapath) claims that a HbA1c range of 4.0-5.9 is normal and not indicative of prediabetes. Regardless, my score is very close to this and it is concerning nevertheless but it isn't extremely bad either.

Viapath also claims that for Diabetics a good score is 6.5-7.5. Can I respectfully ask why isn't it lower than 6.5? Or is this the score that they recommend for Type 1 Diabetics.

Thank you for allowing me to learn more about this condition. God bless and I hope you are all doing well.



Alot of good info here. Yes exercise and diet. And do research. In fact, I can't stress this enough, ask your dr about diabetes classes. My insurance covered it. But even if yours doesn't, pay the money and take it. It will be much cheaper and easier then managing diabetes for the rest of your life.

Having nerve damage from it is no fun. I get pain in my feet every night that keeps me up and leg jerks when trying to sleep. Having a healthy fear of it will motivate you in the right direction. Your lucky that you have prediabetes that can be reversed. But I think you will always want to be mindful and watch your diet as you can get it again.

Also, get yourself a meter if you haven't yet. You can then see what's happening with your sugar levels.

type 2
I was diagnosed T2 diabetic about 20 years ago. I am now 79 and recently had a blood test which showed ''Hb Alc 8.5% HB Alc 69 mmol '' The reference values are 4.8 to 5.9 and 29 to 42, so my readings are too high.
I can't see my doctor for three weeks but can anyone explain these figures and suggest the cause and remedy?


Low platelet count, Raised MPV/PDW
Hi, my father is around 70 years old. He is Indian and diabetic but has controlled his sugar well. He also had a cyst (possibly malignant) in prostate a couple of years back, from which he recovered well with BCG therapy.

Recently, he underwent some routine hematology and pathology tests. Most of his indicators were good, but he had a low platelet count (74000 per microliter) and high blood sugar F. (207 mg%). Also, his MPV (10.8 fL) and PDW (16.2%) were raised too. My father is also fully vaccinated against Covid19.

I read somewhere about research indicating that diabetes is correlated to high platelet reactivity, low platelet count and high MPV. But I also read that many other factors can cause low platelet count including infections, cancerous cells, etc. and with his history of cyst, we are worried.

What is your recommendation? Did anyone have similar experience?

What is a good blood sugar level though.
I have some anxiety about the diabetes condition though. I did a blood sugar test though. It was a 101 blood sugar level though. Is that mean that I may have the diabetes condition though. I have some anxiety about getting the diabetes condition. Can someone give me some advice on this. Thanks.


Can you eat before doing a blood sugar test though.
I will have to take a blood sugar test though. I have some anxiety about it. Does anyone know if you can eat before doing a blood sugar test though. Any advice would be nice. Thanks.

Morning highs
Hello
I need some help with morning highs, I started on 500 mg of metformin once a day it's been 3 weeks which I know it not a long time, my morning highs range from 130 to 150.


Home monitor readings and how to take them.
I recently bought a monitor because I was getting attacks of fatigue. One or two of these were quite worrying needing to take it easy. On woke me up early hours and I had to get up. Have not had any for couple of weeks and only six or seven in tha last month. This all came on when last Feb I have a series of bloody stools followed by a yellow stool but his has not reoccurred but left me with slightly lighter brown stools so I suspect a degree of malabsorption.

The values I am getting with the monitor is 5.5 min and 6.1. I tried after waking just having water and it was 6.1.The chart with the monitor says I am in the normal range.

Does this mean pre diabetes or should I take more readings?



Has anyone ever heard of anyone being allergic to Metformin?
I'm pre-diabetic, and I've been this way many years. So as a precaution my Dr gave me Metformin 500 mg. On the 3rd day, I had an allergic reaction. I was itchy all over, and I felt slightly short of breath for several hours. I've stopped taking it and those symptoms are gone. One relative said she never heard of anyone being allergic to Metformin, and the pharmacist is also skeptical. The Dr is out of town until next week. Has anyone ever heard of anyone being allergic to Metformin? I'm also highly allergic to any form of Sulfer.




Re: Has anyone ever heard of anyone being allergic to Metformin?
I found the info readily that medical care should be sought if there is an allergic reaction such as itching; swelling of the face, tongue and/or throat; severe dizziness, or trouble breathing.

I would classify you having all over body itching and shortness of breath as an allergic reaction...unless you have liver disease or bile duct blockage, which all over body itching can be a symptom.

One would figure a pharmacist would look it up as per your enquiry.

I suggest you do your own research and stay off the medication until you see or talk to your doctor. Do you have an appointment?

keep us updated,
q

Anything to do to not get the diabetes condition though.
I have some anxiety of getting the diabetes condition. I like to eat sweet things though. I like to eat carbs kind of foods ya. Can eating these kind of things cause me to get diabetes though. Is there anything I can do to not get the diabetes condition though. Any advice would be nice. Thanks.



Lab Results: Do I have Diabetes or Pre diabetes?
Hi - I visited with my primary care physician today.

Lab results:
Fasting glucose: 121
A1C: 6.3

I am overweight. Blood pressure under control with meds.

Doc said I have "a touch of diabetes" or "mild" diabetes. He wants to start me on what he calls a low dose of metformin (500mg once a day).

I asked doc if I should see an endocrinologist and he said no because the numbers "aren't that high" and he can manage it. That said, I made an endocrinologist appointment anyway.

QUESTION: Everything I read suggests my fasting glucose and A1C are right on that border of pre-diabetes / diabetes so given how close I am to the thresholds, with a focus on weight loss, diet/exercise, can this go away?

Thanks for any insights you can share.
Re: Lab Results: Do I have Diabetes or Pre diabetes?
I believe 6.4 is pre diabetic. I take Merforim 500 mg twice a day. That’s was started when my A1C was 7.0. It was recently, 6.4 but she kept me on. I guess she wants to see the same or better result .Dr must have given you meds so it doesn’t get any higher. Although, I’m my opinion, the Dr should have given you 90 days to see if diet could bring down numbers on own. If not, then start meds. The A1C test 3 months of your blood for diabetes. The 121 is probably your average number daily for the past 3 months. On the high side. In the old says it was almost normal and then they changed the guidelines to 99 I think.

Get a copy of your blood work. You should always have a copy anyway. That will show you what your result is and normal range. Most labs and doctors have portals you sign up for so you can go in and see results etc.

Please reply regarding random test of diabetes
Iam 44 years old iast January. Iam over weight. Usually my blood sugar is 70-80. Yet earlier there is a random test at d supernarket and they were marketing a product for diabetes. Its so happened that I just took 2 cans of soda 2 hours ago ate 1 cup of rice, chicken and pork. The result turned 220. Is that accurate? I am really nervous.


Re: Please reply regarding random test of diabetes
Random testing is meant to be a screening test. As such, though results may not represent your true glucose handling ability, imho your numbers are high enough to seek more accurate testing.

I can understand why you're nervous. I recently was classed as prediabetic. But that said, diabetes is treatable and type 2 diabetes can be controlled, sometimes with proper diet and weight loss alone. It's in your best interest to investigate this a little more and see your doctor. You really have nothing to lose and much to gain health wise.

Pre-diabetes
I have a doctors appointment in a week to go over a blood test I had done, but I already have seen the results myself. The report says Fasting: N, which I take to mean that it was a not a fasting test, but it actually was. The last meal I had was over 12 hours before I had my blood drawn.

My last physical showed a blood glucose of 99mg, which the doctor had circled as being something I should lower. I have really watched my diet since then and I exercise 5 days a week, both cardiovascular and weightlifting. I at least appear to be very fit. But my glucose level this time was 120 mg, so that has me really worried. All my other blood numbers, cholesterol, tryglycerides and such appear to be excellent.

If eating properly and exercise are the two main ways to prevent diabetes, I just don't know what else I can do. One thing I saw is that stress can elevate blood sugar. But can it spike it? I left my house the morning of the blood test and I had forgotten something at my house that I had to turn around and retrieve. This made me stressed about making the appointment on time on top of the fact that doctor office visits don't generally calm me anyway. Could this have caused a higher than normal blood glucose level for that morning?
 	

I saw your 3 month old, unanswered post, and figured I'd respond. 

Back 20+ years I suffered from Diabetes 2 and also Insulin Resistance (both of which go hand in hand). My Insulin Resistance was so bad that I had to severely limit carbs, especially those with a high glycemic index.

I couldn't eat fruits, or tomatoes, or potatoes, rice or pasta; and I had to eat very small, low calorie, low carb meals.

As my Insulin Resistance and Diabetes 2 and pancreas slowly improved over the years, I was able to increase the amount, quality and tastefulness of the carbs in my diet.

That said, my point is: My diet was dictated by my blood sugar readings and the severity of my symptoms. So, it just begs the question of, "What does eating properly mean" when it comes to Insulin Resistance and Diabetes 2?


Victoza or Trulicity
My new doctor want to change my Current diabetes medicine Byetta to Trulicity or Victoza. I was wondering if anyone is one them drugs and if so does it help? and any side effects? Thanks for any input. Ken

Special diet for diabetes
My boyfriend has diabetes & it runs in his family. His diet is terrible & I'm shocked with what I see him eating. He eats Mexican food a lot, and I love Mexican food also but I don't eat it very often. I'm not diabetic, but I've been told by my Dr. to watch my carb intake because my numbers were high. Since that time I've changed my diet & got my numbers down. I have asked my boyfriend why he's not watching his diet & he said he doesn't need to. (???) I questioned if his Dr. told him to clean up his diet & he said no. He's either lying or he has a bad Dr. Don't all diabetics have to watch their diet? I'm concerned for him, but he just keeps telling me I'm being silly & tries to get me to eat as bad as he does. Another friend of mine was diagnosed as a diabetic & he drank a six pack of cokes everyday even after being told he had it. He didn't watch his diet & acted like it was OK to not change it. Unfortunately he ended up having a stroke & was bedridden for two yrs. & then died. I believe this wouldn't have happened to him if he'd of paid attention & cleaned up his diet. I tried to get him to stop drinking cokes & start drinking water but he wouldn't do it. I don't think diabetes is anything to mess around with. When my Dr. told me my chlosterol was too high I paid attention. It's not always fun to eat healthy, but I'm so used to it now I can feel the difference, plus I lost 10 pounds from doing it.


Just over max glucose but A1C is normal
Visited my cardiologist and had blood work done. Everything normal except HDL (very low), LDL, (slightly elevated) and fasting glucose which was 115 mg/dL. A1C was 5.6. How can I have such a high glucose level and normal A1C? Should I tell my PCP?

U-500 Insulin
My Dr is putting me on Humulin R U-500 insulin because of a few things. #1 I'm taking 228 units a day now. #2 I'm on cancer medication that is causing a 100++ increase in my numbers every day. My question is does the U-500 make a difference? I know it's concentrated but I need my numbers to go down. I can't stop the cancer meds.

Greatly concerned about medications, need help!
My husband has type 2 diabetes, diagnosed about 20 years ago. He is 72 and no other health problems. His diabetes has been under control with an A1C of around 7, taking Metformin twice a day and Junivia and Glipazide. Since he retired last year and became less active, his numbers have increased and his A1C was 10 during his last exam. His Doctor placed him on Ozempic .25 once a week, and continue the
Junivia, and Metformin and stop the Glipazide. His numbers have came down a little from 350s to 250s in the past 3 weeks, but still too high plus he’s lost 13 pounds on Ozempic and he doesn’t need to loose weight. He’s weak, tired, can’t eat. He has a follow up appt this week and the doctor mentioned placing him on a “long acting insulin shot” once a night. What? Another shot? We are both greatly concerned at the thought of 2 shots and 2 meds for diabetes. What are your thoughts? Do people do insulin with Ozempic? Does the weight loss slow down to a halt? Please reply with your experience with these drugs. Thank you so so much for your help.

Re: Greatly concerned about medications, need help!
Hi ChunkyChick! Sorry to hear about your husband's diabetic and health problems.

I was diagnosed with Heart Failure, Persistent AFib and Diabetes 2 in 1987.

I did not want to take diabetes medications. Instead I researched diets dealing with Insulin Resistance and then completely changed my diet to deal with Insulin Resistance and Diabetes 2. It was the best thing that I could ever do for my health.

I learned that, when we weaken our pancreas by consuming too many high-glycemic carbs, our body's handling of insulin and blood sugar gets messed up and can do all kinds of harm to our body and our health. Too much insulin or blood sugar is like poison to our body. It can create all kinds of nasty health problems.

The most powerful medication that we can take is a small meal, low calorie, low glycemic, frequent eating diet, IMHO.

Mostly through my diet, at 76 years old, I am feeling better and doing better than I was at age 50!

Has your husband's diabetes doctor ever suggested an Insulin Resistance Diet?
