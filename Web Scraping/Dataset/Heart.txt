My cardiologist recommended I get on metropolol. My blood pressure, cholesterol and pulse are all normal and I have no chest pains, shortness of breath or other heart problem symptoms. My EKG showed some irregularity, and an ultrasound showed mild Plaqueing in one carotid artery. I have read that once you start a beta blocker you're on it for the rest of your life. Also, there can be some pretty serious side effects. Any thoughts?

Hi, its been a while since you posted and i hope you’ve now been reassured that beta blockers can be stopped if you no longer need them. There are side affects, but for some, the benefits far outweigh things like fatigue and bradycardia.
