Hi everyone,
After seeking advice from an A&E doctor and my own GP, I recently halved my 1.25mg tablets of Bisoprolol as I was finding that my heart rate was going into the 50s in the day whilst resting and the lower 40s at night when asleep which was making me feel tired and fatigued whilst at my desk at work.
I originally started the 1.25mg dose in September of 2022 after I was diagnosed with ectopic ventricular and atrial beats. A 24 hour ECG showed only 1 - 2% of my beats are ectopics and so it is quite a low frequency overall. An Ultrasound scan showed that I have a completely healthy heart and I am not taking any other medications at the moment. Blood tests have shown nothing out of the ordinary, including heart-specific ones that were done in A&E when I recently attended with ectopics. As far as the professionals are concerned, the only thing they can see is bradycardia on the ECG and the presence of some ectopic beats.
I am 29 years old, male from the UK standing 5ft 3 inches tall and weighing around 13 Stones 10 Pounds. I don’t do drugs or smoke, and only occasionally drink alcohol on a weekend.
Is it normal for me to still be getting bradycardia and for my resting heart rate to go down to around 55bpm after I’ve been taking a reduced dose (0.625mg) now for around a week? I have also noticed an increase in anxiety levels too, but never any chest pains, fainting or anything like that.
Cheers!
