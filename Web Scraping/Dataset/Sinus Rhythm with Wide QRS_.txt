Last year I had a severe problem with AFib with RVR. It has been helped with two cardioversions and one ablation though I still have it from time to time.
My Kardia Mobile shows a ton of PVCs and a lot of SVEs. Yesterday, for the first time it’s starting to show Sinus Rhythm with Wide QRS. I really don’t know much about QRS. Is this something I should notify my doctor of or wait until my next appointment?
The last few days I have felt horrible, similar to when my AFib was out of control. Extremely weak.
Thanks for any insight,.
