I have so many questions I need to ask anyone who is very knowledgable in the subject of Iron Overload

Hi Annrosie,
Well its a long story how long have you got lol! Thankfully I’m a lot more chilled about stuff now than I was when I posted this message - It feels like such a long time ago to be honest.
Ok, so for an awful long time (maybe 2? 3 years or so I had been feeling very run down, so I guessed I had anaemia and started taking multi vitamins with Iron). By the time I was diagnosed with Haemochromatosis my iron store was way way off the scale!! Its still pretty high tbh and the treatment is not pleasant to say the least. So you see I wasn’t taking “too much iron” as such, it was the correct daily dose for a “regular person”, but with haemochromatosis it builds up year after year and your body can’t deal with it.
I hope that answers your question and thank you for asking.
take care,
Bart

Yeah that’s good, glad I managed to clear it up for you.
So what brings you to this bizarre and empty place?
And out of interest what music are you into?
