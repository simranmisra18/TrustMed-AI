Any idea which vein this is that comes over/around the knee cap? I have a varicose vein that has flared up quite a few times but recently it became very inflamed. Not sure if it is at a point where surgical intervention may be required and I am in between GP’s at the moment due to moving house and not being able to get registered yet.
