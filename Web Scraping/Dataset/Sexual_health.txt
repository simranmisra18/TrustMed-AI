What are the main STIs?
The ten most common STIs in the UK are:
Anogenital warts.

There are some other STIs that are uncommon in the UK - for example, donovanosis and chancroid.
A 2023 report from UK Health Security Agency (see Further Reading below) reported:
The impact of STIs is still greatest in those aged 15 to 24 years, gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men and some minority ethnic groups.
The impact of STIs is still greatest in those aged 15 to 24 years, gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men and some minority ethnic groups.
The most commonly diagnosed STI was chlamydia, which accounted for nearly half (48%) of all new STI diagnoses.

Gonorrhoea accounted for about 1 in 5 new diagnoses.
Gonorrhoea accounted for about 1 in 5 new diagnoses.
Syphilis diagnoses increased 9.4% and there was a larger proportional increase in syphilis diagnoses among heterosexual men and women than among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men.

Other conditions that are sometimes thought of as STIs
Some other infections may be mistaken for STIs because they can either affect the genital region or can be passed by any close contact, including but not only during sexual contact. Examples include:
Scabies.

Symptoms of each STI can vary, from local symptoms affecting the genitals, to symptoms that affect various other parts of the body. The following is not a full list of all possible symptoms. However, these are the common symptoms to look out for:
A vaginal discharge.

But remember, in many cases of STI, no symptoms may develop. However, you can still pass on the infection to others even if you have no symptoms. Therefore, if you think that you may have an STI, it is best to get it checked out.
What should I do if I suspect that I have an STI?
If you have a symptom that you think is due to an STI, or if you have no symptoms but are worried you have caught an STI then you should see a health professional.
How do you find out if you have an STI?
You can:
Contact your own doctor. Your doctor can give advice and may examine you. However, if your doctor suspects that you may have an STI, in the UK they are likely to refer you to a GUM (genitourinary medicine) clinic. Some doctors may do tests and manage the situation without a referral to a GUM clinic; or

Until you are checked out, and treated if necessary, you should not have sex. This is to prevent you passing on any infection.
STI tests
Depending on the initial assessment and examination, the doctor may advise on some STI tests and ask for your consent to do the tests. Learn more in the separate leaflet called STI tests.
Advice about sexual partners
If you are diagnosed with an STI then the clinic will encourage you to tell any current or recent sexual partners that you have an infection. You are not obliged to do this or to give out any information about other people. However, it is best that any recent sexual partners should know that they might also be infected. They should be offered testing and treatment if necessary, to prevent the infection being spread any further. This telling of sexual partners is sometimes called contact tracing. If you prefer, clinics can contact people anonymously if you do not wish to tell them yourself. You should be aware that recklessly exposing a sexual partner to the risk of infection is against the law.
STI treatment
The treatment that you will be offered depends on which STI is found. For example:
A short course of antibiotics can usually clear away chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomonas.

Treatments for genital herpes, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV are more involved and complex. You will be given advice about what treatment options you have and given time to ask questions.
If you are prescribed antibiotics then it is important to finish the full course of tablets, or else the infection may not be fully cleared. If you develop side-effects then seek advice from the GUM clinic or from your doctor as to what to do. Do not simply stop taking the medication. For some infections you will be asked to return after a course of treatment to check that the infection has gone.
Do not have sex again until the time advised by the clinic. Depending on the infection, this may be for a certain length of time after treatment has finished or it may be until you are given the all clear from a repeat test. The aim is to prevent you from passing on the infection to others.
Advice from a sexual health adviser
Most clinics will have a sexual health adviser. You are likely to be seen by the adviser in addition to being seen by a doctor or nurse. A sexual health adviser is specially trained and can:
Tell you more about STIs and how to avoid catching them in future. For example, the risk of infection increases with the number of changes of sexual partner. Wearing a condom during sex helps to prevent against STIs.

STI prevention
Although sex should be an enjoyable activity, it can put you at risk because it involves being very close (intimate) with another person, and so may allow infections to pass from one person to another. 'Safer sex' usually refers to having sex in a way which reduces your risks of catching an STI. Sex can never be completely without any risk but taking a few sensible precautions can reduce the risks greatly. See the leaflet on Safer Sex for more information.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV
PrEP is available for some people who are at high risk of HIV infection, such as if your sexual partner is HIV positive. PrEP is now available free on the NHS in England from sexual health clinics. PrEP may involve:
Taking one tablet every day, or
Taking one tablet every day, or
Only taking PrEP when needed (two tablets two to 24 hours before sex, one tablet 24 hours after sex and a further tablet 48 hours after sex). This is called event-based or on-demand PrEP.

Contraception is the process of taking steps to ensure you do not become pregnant when you have sex. There are many options for doing this. They all have pros and cons. Different methods will be right for different couples, or right for you at different times in your life. This leaflet gives a brief summary of the methods of contraception. A more detailed leaflet is available for each of the methods described.

What is contraception?
How effective is contraception?
All the methods of contraception listed below are effective. However, no method is completely (100%) reliable. The reliability for each method is given in percentages, or in numbers of women per 100 women. If the method fails in less than 1 in 100 women, the number of women who fall pregnant may be given per 1,000 women.
Sexual health
What is the best interval to leave between having your children? People often ask the question, although not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to choose that spacing. There are probably as many views on the 'best' interval between children as there are families with children, and none can be wrong.
by Dr Mary Elisabeth Lowth, FRCGP
Sexual health
Before your periods stop altogether, it is likely that your periods will become irregular and unpredictable.
by Dr Toni Hazell, MRCGP
For example, the contraceptive injection is more than 99% effective. In other words it is effective for more than 99 women in 100. This means less than 1 woman in 100 will become pregnant each year using this method of contraception. It is hard to understand the concept of less than one woman, so in this case the number is given out of 1,000 women instead of 100. For the example of injections, between 3 and 60 women out of every 1,000 using this method will fall pregnant.
When no contraception is used, around 85 in 100 sexually active women become pregnant within one year.
The effectiveness of some methods depends on how you use them. These are called "user-dependent methods". You have to use them properly or they do not work as well. For example, the combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill (often referred to as "the pill") is more than 99% effective if taken correctly. However, if you miss pills or are sick (vomit) then it becomes less effective. Other user-dependent methods include:
Barrier methods (male and female condoms, diaphragms and caps).

The pros and cons of each method are briefly summarised below and then linked to more information about each specific type.
Combined oral contraceptive pill
The combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill is often what is meant when people say they are "on the pill" Between 3 and 90 women in 1,000 using the pill will become pregnant each year. The difference is due to how well the woman uses the pill. The pill contains two female hormones called oestrogen and progestogen. Different brands suit different people.

Contraceptive patch
The contraceptive patch contains the same hormones as the COC pill but in patch form. It works in the same way and has many of the same pros and cons. Between 3 and 90 women in 1,000 will become pregnant using it. The contraceptive patch is stuck on to the skin so that the two hormones are continuously delivered to the body. There is one combined contraceptive patch available in the UK, called Evra®.

Contraceptive vaginal ring
The contraceptive vaginal ring also contains the same hormones as the COC pill. These hormones have effects on your body which prevent you from becoming pregnant. It is a flexible, see-through ring which is just over 5 cm in diameter. It sits in your vagina for three weeks and then you have one week without it. After exactly one week, you put a new ring into your vagina. It is about as effective as the COC pill at preventing pregnancy.

Contraceptive implants
A contraceptive implant is a small device placed under the skin. It contains a progestogen hormone which slowly releases into the body. Around 1 woman in 2,000 using the implant will become pregnant each year. It involves a small minor operation. An injection of local anaesthetic is used to numb the skin. Each implant lasts three years, after which it should be removed.

Natural methods
Most natural family planning methods involve getting to know your cycle and when you are fertile. You can then use barrier methods of contraception, or not have sex, at these times. This has very variable effectiveness, as it depends how careful you are. As many as 25 women in 100 can become pregnant using this method. However, when used very carefully, this number can be much, much lower. You have to be very committed and check your fertility regularly.

Sterilisation
Sterilisation involves an operation. It is very effective but no method of contraception is 100% reliable. Male sterilisation (vasectomy) is easier, as it can be done under local anaesthetic and is also more reliable. These methods are often used when your family is complete. You should be sure of your decision, as they are difficult to reverse.

See the separate leaflets called Male Sterilisation (Vasectomy) and Female Sterilisation for more information.
Emergency contraception
Emergency contraception can be used if you had sex without using contraception, or if you had sex but there was a mistake with contraception. For example, a split condom or if you missed taking your usual contraceptive pills. Emergency options are a pill or an IUCD (also known as a coil). Read about emergency contraception.
What is the best contraceptive option as I get older?
Although pregnancy is less likely around the menopause, over the age of 40 years it is still important to use contraception. There are various different types of contraception available. Many can be used until you have gone through the menopause or are aged 55 years. Read about the different types of contraception available for women who are aged 40 until their menopause.
Further information
This leaflet is just a very brief account of each method of contraception. All these methods have their own detailed leaflet for more information. Or you can contact your practice nurse, doctor, pharmacist or local family planning clinic if you want more detailed information about any of these methods.

Preventing and treating bacterial vaginosis
Vaginal thrush (also known as vaginal yeast infection or vulvovaginal candidiasis) is an infection of the vagina and/or vulva with a yeast germ called candida. In this leaflet we'll cover vaginal thrush symptoms as well as potential thrush treatments.

What is vaginal thrush?
Thrush is caused by the overgrowth of a fungus called candida.
We all have many germs living on or inside us all the time. Some of these germs are helpful to us - for instance, 'friendly' bacteria in the gut help us to digest our food. Many others don't cause any harm, or any symptoms, unless they grow too much. Candida is one of these.
Fungi like warm, moist, airless places, and a vagina is a perfect home for them. Small numbers of candida commonly live on the skin and around the vaginal area. Most of the time, they don't cause any problems. However sometimes they multiply and cause thrush symptoms.
Candida can also cause fungal skin infections and mouth infections (oral thrush). See those leaflets for more information.
This leaflet focuses on vaginal yeast infections (vaginal thrush).
Vaginal thrush symptoms
Sometimes thrush symptoms are minor and clear up on their own. Often symptoms can be quite irritating and will not go until they are treated with antifungal medicine.
Itching
Itching of the skin folds outside the vagina (the vulva) is one of the most common thrush symptoms. It may also be itchy inside the vagina.
How would I know if I have a yeast infection?
Soreness
There may also be soreness of the vulva. Sometimes it may be painful to pass urine and/or painful to have sex. If there is soreness without itching, this is more likely to have another cause.
Vaginal discharge
There may also be a discharge from the vagina. Thrush is the second most common cause of a vaginal discharge. (The most common cause of vaginal discharge is bacterial vaginosis. See the separate leaflet called Bacterial vaginosis for more details.)
The discharge from thrush is usually creamy white and quite thick, and may resemble cottage cheese, but is sometimes watery. It can add to the itch, redness, discomfort, or pain around the vulva. The discharge from thrush does not usually smell.
Severe thrush symptoms
Thrush symptoms indicating quite a severe case include:
Redness (erythema) - usually around the vagina and vulva, but may extend to the labia majora and perineum.

In these cases it's best to contact your doctor or visit a sexual health clinic.
How long does vaginal thrush last?
A mild thrush infection can get better within a few days, sometimes even without treatment.
More severe thrush can last several weeks.
With treatment, thrush improves within days and should be gone within one or two weeks of starting treatment.
It's important to speak to a doctor if thrush treatment hasn't worked after two weeks.
Diagnosing vaginal thrush
You do not always need a test to diagnose vaginal thrush. The diagnosis is often based on the typical symptoms and signs.
It is important that you do not assume that a vaginal discharge is thrush. There are other causes of vaginal discharge. It is reasonable to assume it is thrush if:
You have a vaginal and/or vulval itch.
You have a vaginal and/or vulval itch.
Any discharge you have does not smell and is white or creamy.
Any discharge you have does not smell and is white or creamy.
You have no abnormal bleeding.
You have no abnormal bleeding.
However, if you have assumed you have thrush and you have had treatment, but the symptoms have not gone away, you may need to have tests. See your doctor, who may examine you and may arrange some tests.
If tests are needed they may include:
A test to see how acidic the vagina is (a pH test)
The level of acidity gives an indication of whether a discharge is due to thrush or to bacterial vaginosis. This is the basis of the over-the-counter test for thrush.
A test strip is placed into the vagina and then the colour change indicates if thrush is likely or not. A pH level of 4.5 or less suggests thrush. Some doctors may also use this test.
A swab
This is a stick with a cotton bud at the end of it. A sample of discharge is taken from the vagina and analysed in a laboratory. This indicates if you have thrush or another infection. It can also inform the doctor about which type of candida you have. You will be able to take this swab yourself and the healthcare professional will tell you how.
Tests for other infections
Further swabs may be taken to be sure you do not have other types of vaginal infections.
Urine tests
Your urine may be checked for sugar. This is to check you do not have diabetes, as this would make you more prone to thrush. This might be done if you were getting repeated (recurring) episodes of thrush. Urine may also be checked for infection, as sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish between a urine infection and thrush.
Blood tests
For severe or repeated (recurrent) episodes of thrush, you might be offered a blood test to look for anything that could be making you more vulnerable to it. This might include a check for diabetes and an HIV test.
What causes vaginal thrush?
Thrush is not considered a sexually transmitted infection, although occasionally it is passed on during sex. Usually it is an overgrowth of the candida yeast which was already there but hadn't been causing a problem. Thrush can affect your sex life until it clears up.
The immune system and the harmless germs (bacteria) that also normally live on the skin and in the vagina usually stop candida from thriving. However, when conditions are good for candida, numbers multiply and may invade the vagina and cause thrush symptoms. This could be due to changes in the balance of bacteria in the vagina when you have taken antibiotics. Or it could be related to hormone changes, or problems with your immune system.
Most causes of thrush are a result of Candida albicans but sometimes other types of candida such as Candida glabrata or Candida tropicalis are the cause.
Vaginal thrush treatment
There are a few different thrush treatment options. Some are applied directly to the vagina and/or vulva; others are medicines which are taken by mouth.
How do you cure a yeast infection?
Topical thrush treatments
These are pessaries and creams which you insert into the vagina with an applicator. They contain anti-yeast medicines such cream containing clotrimazole, econazole, miconazole or fenticonazole.
A single large dose inserted into the vagina is often sufficient to clear a bout of thrush. Alternatively a lower dose is used for several days. You may also want to rub some anti-thrush cream on to the skin around the vagina (the vulva) for a few days, especially if it is itchy. In mild cases, or for girls under the age of 16, a cream for the skin may be all that is needed.
You can obtain topical treatments on prescription, or you can buy some of them without a prescription at pharmacies. Side-effects are uncommon, but read the information leaflet that comes with your thrush treatment for full information.
In general, you can use these topical thrush treatments if you are pregnant but you should always check with your doctor or pharmacist. Treatment is usually needed for longer during pregnancy.
Note: some pessaries and creams may damage latex condoms and diaphragms and affect their use as a contraceptive. You should use alternative methods of contraception during treatment and for several days afterwards.
Tablets
Two thrush treatment tablets are available. Fluconazole, which is taken as a single dose, or itraconazole which is taken as two doses over the course of one day. You can obtain these thrush treatments on prescription; you can also buy fluconazole without a prescription from pharmacies. Side-effects are uncommon, but always read the information leaflet that comes with your thrush treatment for full information.
Do not take these medications if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. You may also want to rub some anti-yeast cream on to the skin around the vagina for a few days, especially if it is itchy. Combination packs containing both the tablet and the cream are available. With severe vaginal yeast infection, a repeat dose of the tablet may be suggested after three days.
Note: tablets and topical treatments are thought to be equally effective. Tablets are more convenient but are more expensive than most topical treatments.
If you are in a sexual relationship, there is no need to treat your partner too unless they also have thrush symptoms. (If you have a male partner, see the Thrush in men leaflet for more information on those symptoms).
How to soothe thrush itching
If you have vaginal thrush, you may also find the following things help to relieve your symptoms:
Avoiding wearing tight-fitting clothing, especially clothing made from synthetic materials. Loose-fitting, natural-fibre (such as cotton) underwear may be better.

What if the vaginal thrush treatment doesn't work?
If you still have vaginal thrush symptoms a week after starting treatment, then see your doctor or nurse. Treatment does not clear symptoms in up to 1 in 5 cases. Reasons why thrush treatment may fail include:
The symptoms may not be due to thrush. There are other causes of a vaginal discharge. Also, thrush can occur at the same time as another infection. You may need tests such as vaginal swabs (samples taken using a small ball of cotton wool on the end of a thin stick) to clarify the cause of the symptoms.

Most bouts of thrush are caused by C. albicans. However, about 1 in 10 bouts of thrush are caused by other strains of candida, such as C. glabrata. These may not be so easily treated with the usual anti-thrush medicines.

How common is vaginal thrush?
Thrush is very common. Up to three out of four women will have at least one bout of thrush in their lives. In most cases it develops for no apparent reason. However, certain factors can make thrush more likely to develop.
The vagina contains mucus and some harmless bacteria which help to defend the vagina from candidal infection (and other germs). These natural defences may be altered or upset by certain situations:
When you are pregnant.
When you are pregnant.
If you have diabetes.
If you have diabetes.
If you take antibiotic medication.

If you have a weakened immune system or it's working normally. For example, if you are on chemotherapy for certain cancers, if you are taking high-dose steroids, or if you have HIV, etc.
If you have a weakened immune system or it's working normally. For example, if you are on chemotherapy for certain cancers, if you are taking high-dose steroids, or if you have HIV, etc.
So in these situations you may be more likely to get symptoms of thrush and develop thrush itself.
Why do I keep getting vaginal thrush?
You may also be more prone to recurring thrush episodes (recurrent thrush) although some women develop repeated episodes of vaginal thrush with no obvious triggers. If you do suffer from recurrent thrush, your doctor may offer different treatment - see the separate leaflet called Treating recurring yeast infections (Vaginal thrush) for more details.
There is some relationship between vaginal thrush and the female hormone oestrogen. Thrush is much more common in the 'reproductive years', ie the years between starting to have periods and stopping for menopause. Some women are prone to thrush in certain times of their menstrual cycle - for example, before a period.
The hormone changes of pregnancy make thrush more likely. It may be that hormone pills such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill make you more prone to thrush. This is not yet certain, however.
Is vaginal thrush dangerous?
Thrush does not damage the vagina and it does not spread to the womb (uterus). If you are pregnant, thrush will not harm your baby.
If you have thrush when giving birth, the baby can sometimes catch it during delivery. However, this can easily be treated, and isn't something to be worried about.
Do I need to contact a doctor if I get vaginal thrush?
If you have had a vaginal thrush infection in the past and the same symptoms come back then it is common practice to treat it without an examination or tests. Many women know when they have thrush and treat it themselves. You can buy effective treatments without a prescription from pharmacies.
However, remember a vaginal discharge or vulval itch can be due to a number of causes. So, do not assume all discharges or itches are thrush. The following gives a guide as to when it may be best to contact a doctor or nurse if you think that you might have thrush. If you:
Are under 16 or over 60 years of age.

How do you prevent vaginal thrush?
These tips may help you to avoid vaginal thrush, or avoid it coming back. However, research has not yet proven they always work:
Hygiene
Vaginal thrush is not due to poor hygiene. However, the normal conditions of the vagina (how it needs to be to work well) may be altered by excess washing and rinsing out (douching) of the vagina, bubble baths, scented soaps, spermicides, etc.
The normal mucus and germs (bacteria) in the vagina may be upset by these things and allow candida to infect. Therefore, it may be best to just wash with water and unscented soap and not to douche the vagina.
Clothes
Don't wear nylon underwear or tight-fitting jeans too often. Loose cotton pants are best. Stockings rather than tights are preferable. The aim is to prevent the vaginal area from being constantly warm, moist and airless. Avoid washing underwear in biological washing powder and using fabric conditioners.
Antibiotic medicines
Be aware that thrush is more likely if you take antibiotics for other conditions. Antibiotics may kill the normal harmless bacteria in the vagina that help to defend against candida. As species of candida are yeasts and not bacteria, they will not be killed by antibiotics.
This is not to say that every course of antibiotics will lead to thrush. But, if you are prone to this problem and you are prescribed antibiotics then have some anti-thrush treatment ready to use at the first sign of thrush.
Sex
Thrush is not a sexually transmitted infection. However, friction when you have sex may cause minor damage to the vagina which may make candida more likely to thrive. So, make sure your vagina is well lubricated when having sex. If natural secretions are not sufficient then use a lubricant when you have sex. After sex, wipe yourself so you are clean and dry.
It may also be worth reviewing any medication you are taking, as some medicines can make you more prone to thrush. You should discuss this with your doctor.

Preventing and treating bacterial vaginosis
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a very common condition caused by an overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina. This causes a change in the normal vaginal discharge, which may become more noticeable or develop a fishy smell.

Can I prevent recurrent bacterial vaginosis?
Having a vaginal discharge can be embarrassing. However, it's a very common symptom, and can be easily treated.
In women who are having periods, bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of a vaginal discharge.
What is bacterial vaginosis?
BV is a disturbance in the mix of harmful bacteria in the vagina. Normally there is a healthy mix of millions of 'friendly' germs (bacteria) in our bodies, including in the vagina - we rely on them being there and they are a part of what keeps us healthy. In BV, the balance of vaginal bacteria is altered.
The type of bacteria called anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that grow in an environment without air) increase in number, whilst another type, called lactobacilli, dies off. This disturbance in the bacteria makes the inside of the vagina slightly less acidic than usual. This slight reduction in acidity then encourages the growth of more anaerobic bacteria and fewer lactobacilli.
Although the changes of BV don't usually cause pain or itching, they do tend to cause a discharge which can smell stronger than usual. Sometimes it smells 'fishy', particularly after sexual activity. It can be watery and greyish in colour.
This can be distressing and make women feel unclean. Some women then try to douche or wash themselves with soaps or perfumes - but this will only disturb the vagina more (because soaps are too alkaline for the inside of the vagina) and will make the problem worse.
Is bacterial vaginosis common?
BV is a common condition, but we don't know exactly how often it occurs. It's been suggested that 1 in 3 women get BV at least once in their lives. But estimating this is difficult, as it is often so mild that women may not go to the doctor.
How do you get bacterial vaginosis?
Bacterial vaginosis is a common condition of the vagina caused by an overgrowth of various germs. It is not one infection, caused by one type of germ.
The vagina normally has a mix of germs (bacteria), including anaerobic bacteria and lactobacilli, but in bacterial vaginosis (BV) the balance changes. As a result, the anaerobic bacteria multiply and thrive much more than usual. In other words, they are bacteria which are normally present, just not in the same balance.
Is bacterial vaginosis caused by poor hygiene?
BV is not caused by poor hygiene. In fact, excessive washing of the vagina (particularly if strong soaps or perfumed deodorants are used) may alter the normal balance of bacteria in the vagina even more, which may make BV more likely to develop or worsen.
We don't really know what triggers the bacterial balance to 'swing' away from normal. We know that it's more likely to happen if something disturbs the acidity of the vagina, (acidity which is CAUSED by the normal bacteria), which then allows the anaerobic bacteria to overgrow.
What is normal vaginal acidity?
Acidity is measured on the pH scale in which lower numbers are more acidic and higher numbers are more alkaline. The normal pH of the vagina is 3.8-4.5.
As soon as the pH increases above 4.5, anaerobic bacteria start to overgrow and lactobacilli (which maintain the acidity) start to die off.
What causes bacterial vaginosis?
You are more likely to get BV:
If you are sexually active. Women who have never had sex can get BV too. However, it is more common in women who are having sex. You can have BV whether you have sex with women or with men:
Women who have sex with women are more likely to get BV. This is because they tend to share the same make-up of bacteria in the vagina.

Is bacterial vaginosis an STD?
No. BV can affect any woman, including those who do not have (or who have never had) sex or those who have multiple sex partners. However, BV is more common amongst sexually active women than amongst non-sexually active women.
A woman can't 'catch' BV from intercourse with a man, but BV is more likely to develop after a change in sexual partner, as - for reasons we don't really understand - this can affect the balance of normal germs (bacteria) in the vagina.
Women who have sex with other women are more likely to get BV. This is probably because women can exchange vaginal bacteria during sex. Women who have sex with women are also more likely to give and receive oral sex, and to share sex toys - both of which are linked with BV.
What does bacterial vaginosis look like?
The main symptom of BV is a vaginal discharge. BV is the most common cause of vaginal discharge in women of childbearing age. Often, BV causes no symptoms. This is true in about half of the women who have the condition. This may be because the bacterial disturbance is only mild.
When BV causes symptoms, this is usually a change in vaginal discharge. Some women will also notice the characteristic smell.
The discharge is often white or grey in colour and often has a fishy smell.

Note: BV is not the only cause of a vaginal discharge. Various conditions can cause discharge, such as thrush (vaginal infection by overgrowth of a yeast called candida, which normally lives in the bowel) and STIs.
Thrush typically causes a thickish white or grey discharge which tends to cause itching and soreness around the vagina and vulva. See the separate leaflet called Vaginal Thrush for more details.

STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea, may also cause vaginal discharge. See the separate leaflets on Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea for more details.
STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea, may also cause vaginal discharge. See the separate leaflets on Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea for more details.
Can bacterial vaginosis cause bleeding?
BV should not cause vaginal bleeding, although it is often more noticeable at the time of a period.
If you have unusual bleeding between periods or after intercourse, BV will not be the reason and you should consult your doctor to look for another cause.
Can bacterial vaginosis cause pain?
BV can sometimes cause pain - usually on intercourse. Some women also describe dull pains low down in their tummy. These are more suggestive of conditions affecting the womb (uterus) itself, such as pelvic inflammatory disease or endometriosis.
Is bacterial vaginosis dangerous?
In certain circumstances, having bacterial vaginosis can cause complications, such as:
BV and surgery
If you have untreated BV, the chance of developing an infection of the womb is slightly higher following certain operations (such as termination of pregnancy or a vaginal hysterectomy). You will normally be offered treatment for the BV in these cases.
BV and other infections
Untreated BV may slightly increase the risk of you acquiring HIV infection if you have sex with someone who has HIV. This is probably because the normal acidity of the vagina helps protect against STIs.
If you have HIV and BV together then you are slightly more likely to pass on the HIV.
Women with untreated BV may be at a slightly increased risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease. See the separate leaflets called HIV and AIDS and Pelvic Pain in Women for more details.
BV and pregnancy
BV can affect pregnancy. If you have untreated BV during pregnancy, you have a slightly increased risk of developing some health problems, including:
Early labour.
Early labour.
Miscarriage.

Having your baby early (preterm birth).

Developing an infection of the womb after childbirth (a condition known as postpartum endometritis).
For this reason, if you develop bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy you will usually be offered treatment. This also means that if you develop an unusual or offensive discharge in pregnancy, you should seek medical advice early.
Subfertility
BV is more common in women who are having problems getting pregnant. In women with BV who are undergoing IVF treatment, the presence of BV lowers the success rates. The studies which found these effects focused on women who were already known to have fertility problems, to see if they were more likely than other women to have BV.
This doesn't mean that if you have BV, you will have fertility problems: BV is extremely common (possibly a third of all women of menstrual age) and fertility problems which result in a need for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) are not common.
This suggests that the chances that BV will affect your fertility are very low. Even so, if you are planning to conceive in the future and you think you may have BV, you should see your doctor and discuss the best options for treatment.
How to test for bacterial vaginosis
If you have typical symptoms, and a sexually-transmitted infection is unlikely, your doctor or nurse may be happy to diagnose BV based solely on your symptoms.
The typical discharge and its characteristic fishy smell make BV likely. When your doctor examines you they may be able to identify BV from the appearance of the discharge.
There are some tests that can help to confirm the diagnosis. Also, if you are pregnant, it is important to make an accurate diagnosis of any unusual vaginal discharge so that any infection can be treated effectively. The tests include:
Testing the acid level of your vagina
The discharge of BV has a typical pH level (acidity level) which is higher than normal vaginal pH.
pH is measured on a scale from 0 (extreme acidity) to 14 (extremely alkaline). Pure water, which is neutral (neither acid nor alkaline) has a pH of 7.
The normal pH of the vagina is 3.8-4.5.
The normal pH of the vagina is 3.8-4.5.
As soon as the pH increases above 4.5, anaerobic bacteria start to overgrow and lactobacilli (which maintain the acidity) start to die off.
As soon as the pH increases above 4.5, anaerobic bacteria start to overgrow and lactobacilli (which maintain the acidity) start to die off.
Your doctor or nurse may suggest that they take a sample of your discharge and test it with some pH paper. You can buy a kit from a pharmacy to do this test yourself at home.
Taking a sample
To confirm the diagnosis of BV, your doctor or nurse may suggest that a sample (a swab) of your discharge be taken from your vagina and sent to the laboratory for examination and testing.
The various types of germs (bacteria) that overgrow in BV are easily seen under the microscope. Your doctor or nurse may suggest that they take more than one swab from your vagina to rule out other causes of vaginal discharge; for example, a test for chlamydia and gonorrhoea.
How to treat bacterial vaginosis
There are various different treatments for BV. There are also some things which you should avoid doing, which may help the problem to resolve itself.
These include avoiding the use of douches, vaginal deodorants, bath additives and harsh soaps. Refraining from intercourse for a couple of weeks, or using a condom and a water-based lubricant, can be helpful.
Antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis
Oral antibiotics are the first-choice treatment in pregnant women with BV.
Metronidazole tablets
A full course of metronidazole tablets is the common treatment. Metronidazole is an antibiotic. This clears BV in most cases. It is important to read the leaflet that comes with these tablets for the full list of possible side-effects and cautions. The main points to note about metronidazole include:
The usual dose is 400-500 mg twice a day for 5-7 days. A single dose of 2 grams of metronidazole is an alternative, although this may be less effective and may cause more side-effects. (Note: this single dose is not recommended if you are pregnant.) It is important to finish the course you have been prescribed, and not to miss any tablets.

(Note: this single dose is not recommended if you are pregnant.) It is important to finish the course you have been prescribed, and not to miss any tablets.
Some people feel sick or may be sick (vomit) when they take metronidazole. This is less likely to occur if you take the tablets straight after food. A metallic taste is also a common side-effect.

Do not drink any alcohol while taking metronidazole, nor for 48 hours after stopping treatment. The interaction of metronidazole with alcohol can cause severe sickness and vomiting, and may also cause flushing and an increased pulse rate.

Metronidazole can get into breast milk in small amounts but will not harm your baby, although it may make the milk taste different. The manufacturer recommends that if you are breastfeeding you should take the 5- to 7-day lower dose course of metronidazole rather than the single large dose.

Other possible antibiotic treatments
Tinidazole tablets may be offered if you know you are intolerant of metronidazole. Tinidazole is a similar antibiotic and you need to take 2 g once a day for two days, or 1 g once a day for five days.
It has the same interaction with alcohol that is seen with metronidazole, meaning that alcohol should not be consumed whilst you are taking it, nor for 48 hours afterwards. Tinidazole is not recommended in pregnancy.
Metronidazole vaginal gel or clindamycin vaginal cream placed inside the vagina can be used if you prefer this type of treatment, or if you experience unpleasant side-effects with metronidazole tablets. These treatments are believed to be almost as effective as antibiotics by mouth.
Note: as with metronidazole tablets, you should avoid alcohol while using metronidazole gel and for at least 48 hours after stopping treatment, although the tendency of the gels to make you feel sick is not as noticeable as for the tablets.
Vaginal creams and gels can weaken latex condoms and diaphragms. Therefore, during treatment and for five days after treatment with clindamycin vaginal cream, do not rely on condoms or diaphragms to protect against pregnancy and STIs.
Other antibiotic tablets taken by mouth are also sometimes used in treating BV. These are clindamycin tablets or tinidazole tablets.
Other ways to get rid of bacterial vaginosis
Yoghurt
Some women with BV say that things settle more quickly and symptoms are eased by applying a thin coat of plain, live yoghurt to the outside of the vagina daily, and by applying a small amount of plain live yoghurt on a tampon for internal use before bed.
The evidence that live yoghurt is helpful in treating or preventing BV is mixed, with some trials saying that it is helpful and some saying that it is not helpful. Overall specialists feel that there is not enough evidence in its favour to suggest it over other treatments.
Astodrimer sodium gel
Astodrimer sodium gel is a new kind of treatment for BV. It can be bought without a prescription online as Betafem® BV gel. It treats BV by creating a physical barrier that repels bacteria from coming close to and sticking to the vaginal wall.
A 2019 trial showed that astodrimer gel once daily for seven days was well tolerated by women and provided rapid improvement in BV symptoms. Patients improved, or were cured at the same rate as with conventional antibiotics.
Vaginal acetic and lactic acid
Treatment with acetic and lactic acid gels aims to keep the vaginal pH at less than 4.5, to encourage lactobacilli to grow, and to discourage anaerobic bacteria from growing. Some studies have suggested that long-term use of vaginal acidifiers of this type reduces recurrences of BV. However, other studies suggest that this treatment, whilst harmless, is not effective.
Lactobacillus tablets
Lactobacillus suppositories and oral tablets are sold in some health food shops, for use in BV.
Orally consumed probiotics are believed to reach the vagina via the bowel. There is some evidence that this can be helpful in treatment and in prevention of BV. These studies suggest treatment needs to continue for at least two months. Other studies don't show a clear benefit. Overall, specialists feel that there is not enough evidence in its favour to suggest it over other treatments.
Intravaginal lactobacillus treatment seems as though it ought to be an obvious solution - why not put the right bacteria where they are meant to go? However, results of studies on vaginal treatments with lactobacilli are also mixed, with some studies suggesting this treatment is effective and others not.
When should I have treatment for bacterial vaginosis?
The body is often very good at getting back its own balance. The disruption in the balance of vaginal germs (bacteria) that causes BV may correct naturally, with time. So, if you have no symptoms or only mild symptoms, you may not need any treatment, particularly if you take some of the general healthy steps above.
You normally need treatment for BV if it is causing symptoms, or if the characteristic smell is noticeable to you. If you are pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or about to have a gynaecological procedure then you may be advised to get treatment for BV.
Pregnancy
If you are pregnant and you are found to have BV then you will usually be offered antibiotic treatment with oral metronidazole (see below).
If you are trying to conceive and you think you may have BV, it is a good idea to try to eradicate the BV through natural methods or treatment prior to conceiving. If you have symptoms then you should discuss having antibiotic treatment with your doctor.
Termination of pregnancy
If you are found to have BV and are undergoing a termination of pregnancy, treatment with antibiotics may be advised even if you do not have any symptoms. This is because there is otherwise a risk of BV causing infection of the womb (uterus) or pelvis after the procedure. This could lead to later fertility problems.
Gynaecological procedures
Antibiotics are not usually recommended for women with BV (and no symptoms) who are about to undergo 'minor' gynaecological procedures such as an endometrial biopsy - a biopsy of the lining of the womb. In fact women having these procedures are in any case not usually tested for BV, so they would not know they had it.
Women having vaginal hysterectomy are given antibiotics prior to the procedure, even if they don't have BV, in order to lower the risk of postoperative infection. These antibiotics will also wipe out any BV-causing bacteria.
Should my partner be treated for bacterial vaginosis?
There is no evidence that treating a male sexual partner prevents his female sexual partner from developing BV. One small trial looked at whether using a sterilising alcohol gel on the penis protected their partners against BV - but the gel appeared to make BV more, rather than less, common in the women.
If you have a female partner then it does appear that treating her for BV at the same time as you - even if she doesn't have symptoms - will prevent recurrence (in either of you).
Do I need any further tests for bacterial vaginosis?
Women who are not pregnant
After treatment, you do not need any further tests to ensure that BV has cleared (a test of cure) provided that your symptoms have gone.
Women who are pregnant
If you are pregnant, it is suggested that you do have a test one month after treatment to ensure that BV is no longer present. A sample (a swab) of the discharge in your vagina is taken. This is tested to check you no longer have BV.
Treatment for persistent bacterial vaginosis
If you have persistent BV (ie it does not settle down with the first treatment you try) then your doctor may want to take further vaginal swabs to check whether there is another cause for the discharge. They will usually suggest that you use the seven-day course of metronidazole if you have not had this before.
Another treatment which may be tried is using metronidazole gel twice a week for up to six months.
If you have a persistent BV infection which does not respond to treatment, and you have an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) then your doctor may advise removing the device until things settle down, as there is some evidence that IUCDs can contribute to persistent BV.
If you have persistent BV and a same-sex partner then treating both of you at the same time is likely to be helpful in preventing persistence and recurrence - even if your partner does not have symptoms.
How to prevent bacterial vaginosis
The following are thought to help prevent some episodes of BV. The logic behind these tips is to try not to upset the normal balance of germs (bacteria) in the vagina:
Do not push water into your vagina to clean it (douching). The vagina needs no specific cleaning.

Will I get bacterial vaginosis again?
BV often recurs, usually within a few months of treatment - although if any of the behaviours which can trigger it (such as using douches) apply to you then it may be less likely to recur if you avoid these things.
BV often returns after it has been treated. No good way has been found yet of preventing this from happening.
If you keep getting BV symptoms, your doctor will do some tests to be absolutely sure you have got BV and not any other infection. If it turns out to be definitely BV, a different antibiotic to the one you have taken previously may be tried. Occasionally regular preventative use of an antibiotic vaginal gel may be advised.
If you are using an IUCD for contraception, it may be advised that you consider having this removed.
Can I prevent recurrent bacterial vaginosis?
If your symptoms come back and you did not have a test using a sample (a swab) of your vaginal discharge taken initially, your doctor or nurse may suggest that they take swab tests now. This is to confirm that it is BV causing your symptoms.
BV may return if you did not complete your course of antibiotics. However, even if you have completed a full course of antibiotics, BV returns within three months in many women. If it does come back, a repeat course of antibiotics will usually be successful. A small number of women have repeated episodes of BV and need repeated courses of antibiotics.
Astodrimer sodium gel also prevents recurrent BV and associated symptoms. In a 2019 study astodrimer sodium significantly reduced BV recurrence rates. You can buy astodrimer sodium gel (brand name Betafem® BV gel) online and do not need a prescription.
If you have a copper coil for contraception - an IUCD - and have recurrent BV, your doctor or nurse may suggest that they remove your IUCD to see if this helps to improve your symptoms. You will need to consider alternative contraception measures.
If you have a same-sex partner then, even if they have no symptoms, treating both of you at the same time may reduce recurrence.
You should also take particular notice of the advice not to use douches, bath additives and vaginal deodorants. Long-term use of metronidazole gel is sometimes advised. Specialist guidelines in the USA recommend using twice-weekly for up to six months. UK specialist guidelines are less certain on the frequency and duration of preventative treatment, and your doctor may want to talk with a specialist for advice on this.
