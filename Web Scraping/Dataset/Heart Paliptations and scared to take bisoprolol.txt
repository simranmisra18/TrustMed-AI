hi everyone I’m 34 and have suffered with palpitations in the past (flutters. skipped beats etc) but they went away for 4 years now they are back. I’ve recently had 2 24 hrs ecgs what didn’t pick anything up and an echocardiogram which I am awaiting the results my gp has prescribed bisoprolol but I’m terrified to take them as I have been reading alot of negativity around them has anyone taken bisoprolol before and what was your experience with them. I have been referred to cardiology for a 7 day ecg awaiting the appointment so i don’t know whether I should start the bisoprolol now or wait until I’ve had the 7 day ecg to see what it picks up. any help would be greatly appreciated.
