Mouth ulcers are common, painful sores inside the mouth that can make eating and drinking uncomfortable. They are usually harmless and often heal on their own, however, stress, hormones, or certain foods can trigger them. This leaflet discusses the different types, causes, treatments, and when to see a doctor.

What are mouth ulcers?
Mouth ulcers are painful sores that can occur anywhere inside the mouth. This leaflet is about the most common type of mouth ulcers, which are aphthous mouth ulcers. At least 1 in 4 people develop aphthous mouth ulcers at some stage in their lives. Women are affected more often than men.
Aphthous mouth ulcers usually first occur between the ages of 10 and 40 years. They then come back (recur) but there can be days, weeks, months, or years between each bout of ulcers. The ulcers tend to recur less often as you become older. In many cases, they eventually stop coming back. Some people feel a burning in part(s) of the mouth for a day or so before an ulcer appears.

Types of mouth ulcers
There are three types:
Minor aphthous mouth ulcers are the most common (8 in 10 cases). They are small, round, or oval and are less than 10 mm across. They look pale yellow but the area around them may look swollen and red. Only one ulcer may develop but up to 6 may appear at the same time. Each ulcer lasts 7-10 days and then goes without leaving a scar. They are not usually very painful.

Herpetiform mouth ulcers occur in about 1 in 10 cases. These are tiny pinhead-sized ulcers, about 1-2 mm across. Multiple ulcers occur at the same time but some may join together and form irregular shapes. Each ulcer lasts one week to two months. Despite the name, they have nothing to do with herpes or the herpes virus.

What causes mouth ulcers?
The cause is not known. They are not infectious and you cannot 'catch' aphthous mouth ulcers. In most cases, the ulcers develop for no apparent reason in people who are healthy.
In some cases the ulcers are related to other factors or diseases. These include:
Injury - such as badly fitting dentures, a graze from a harsh toothbrush, etc.

Some medications can cause mouth ulcers. Medication can cause mouth ulcers in various ways and may not necessarily cause the aphthous type of ulcer. Examples of medicines that can cause mouth ulcers are:
Nicorandil.
Anti-inflammatory medicines (for example, ibuprofen).
Oral nicotine replacement therapy.
Certain tablets which are left to dissolve in the mouth, when they are supposed to be swallowed whole. For example, aspirin can do this if kept to dissolve against a gum. Alendronate, taken to treat 'thinning' of the bones (osteoporosis), can also cause mouth ulcers if it is not taken according to the instructions.

Mouth ulcers are more common in people with certain conditions - for example, Crohn's disease, coeliac disease, HIV infection and Behçet's disease. However, these ulcers are not the aphthous type.
Symptoms in addition to mouth ulcers
You should inform your doctor if you have any other symptoms in addition to the mouth ulcers. Other important symptoms would include skin or genital ulcers or joint pains and inflammation. Sometimes a blood test or other investigations are advised if other causes of mouth ulcers are suspected.
Aphthous mouth ulcer management
Treatment aims to ease the pain when ulcers occur and to help them to heal as quickly as possible. There is no treatment that prevents aphthous mouth ulcers from coming back (recurring).
No treatment may be needed
The pain is often mild, particularly with the common 'minor' type of aphthous ulcer. Each bout of ulcers will go without treatment.
General measures:
When you have mouth ulcers you might want to try:
Avoiding spicy foods, acidic fruit drinks and very salty foods (such as crisps) which can make the pain and stinging worse.

Salt (saline) mouthwashes. Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glassful of warm water, swish around your mouth and spit it out. This can be done as often as needed and may be soothing. Do not swallow the salt mouthwash.

Some medicines may ease your symptoms from the mouth ulcers
Chlorhexidine mouthwash (Corsodyl or Chlorohex) may reduce the pain. This is available for you to buy in any supermarket. It may also help mouth ulcers to heal more quickly. It can help to prevent mouth ulcers from becoming infected. Unfortunately, it does not reduce the number of new ulcers. Chlorhexidine mouthwash is usually used twice a day. It may stain teeth brown if you use it regularly. However, the stain is not usually permanent and can be reduced by avoiding drinks that contain tannin (such as tea, coffee, or red wine) and by brushing teeth before use. Rinse your mouth well after you brush your teeth, as some ingredients in toothpaste can inactivate chlorhexidine.

Steroid lozenges (Corlan pellets) may also reduce the pain and may help mouth ulcers to heal more quickly. These can be bought from pharmacists over the counter; you do not need a prescription. By using your tongue you can keep a lozenge in contact with an ulcer until the lozenge dissolves. A steroid lozenge works best the sooner it is started once an ulcer erupts. If used early, it may 'nip it in the bud' and prevent an ulcer from fully erupting. The usual dose is one lozenge, four times a day, until the ulcer goes. Use for no more than five days at a time.

A painkilling oral rinse, gel, or mouth spray may help to ease pain. The effect of these painkilling medicines is unfortunately short-lived. These can be bought at pharmacies. For all these products, follow the directions in the packet very carefully. Examples include:
Benzydamine spray or mouthwash (Difflam)
Products containing a temporary numbing agent (local anaesthetic) called lidocaine.
Choline salicylate gel (Bonjela). The adult form of Bonjela should not be used in children under the age of 16 due to a potential risk of Reye's syndrome if it is overused. This is the same reason why aspirin cannot be used in children too. Bonjela products for children (teething gel) no longer contain choline salicylate and can therefore be used.

Other treatments for mouth ulcers
You can buy all of the treatments listed above from pharmacies, without a prescription. If the pain is particularly severe, you may also need painkillers. Occasionally the mouth ulcers are severe enough to seek medical attention. The following might be suggested:
Steroid inhalers such as beclometasone, usually used for asthma, can be helpful when sprayed onto the lining of the mouth.

When should I consult a doctor about mouth ulcers?
Aphthous mouth ulcers can be painful and are often a nuisance but are not serious. Occasionally a mouth ulcer can become secondarily infected with bacteria. In this case you may notice more severe pain or redness, or you may be feeling unwell with a high temperature (fever). Secondary bacterial infections are rare but may need treatment with antibiotic medicines.
Remember, not all mouth ulcers are aphthous ulcers. Other types of ulcer can occur in the mouth and mouth ulcers can be a sign of an underlying illness or disease.
Important: cancer of the mouth can sometimes start as an unusual mouth ulcer that does not heal. You should see a doctor or dentist if you have a mouth ulcer that has lasted for more than three weeks without sign of healing, or is different in any way. This is especially important if you are a smoker. Your GP or dentist may refer you urgently to a specialist. A small sample (biopsy) of the ulcer may be taken in clinic and examined, to exclude cancer.
Frequently asked questions
Can I cure mouth ulcers naturally?
Rinsing your mouth with saltwater, applying honey or aloe vera, and avoiding spicy or acidic foods can help ulcers heal faster and reduce pain.
Why do I keep getting mouth ulcers?
Mouth ulcers can keep coming back due to stress, minor injuries, certain foods, hormones, or a weak immune system. They are usually harmless, but frequent ulcers may be a sign of an underlying condition. You should see a doctor if they don't permanently go away.
Are mouth ulcers contagious?
Most mouth ulcers are not contagious and cannot be passed on to other people. However, if an ulcer is caused by a viral infection, such as cold sores, this may be contagious, so it is important to get a proper diagnosis if you are unsure.

Meets Patient’s editorial guidelines
A dental abscess is a collection of pus which can cause toothache and other symptoms. If you suspect that you have a dental abscess, see a dentist as soon as possible for treatment. Without treatment, the condition is likely to become worse and you may lose the affected tooth. Complications are uncommon but can be serious and even life-threatening. GPs are not trained or insured to treat dental problems - do not ring your GP if you have toothache.

What is a dental abscess?
Normal tooth
A dental abscess is a localised collection of pus in a tooth or in nearby structures. Pus is a thick fluid that usually contains white blood cells, dead tissue and germs (bacteria). The usual cause of an abscess is a bacterial infection. They are classified into two main types.
Types of dental abscess
Periapical abscess
This type of abscess starts in the centre of the tooth (the dental pulp). This is the most common type. This type of abscess usually develops as a complication of tooth decay (caries). Dental decay is very common. It damages and breaks down (erodes) the protective layers of the tooth (the enamel and dentine). The damage to the tooth allows bacteria to invade the pulp to cause an infection.
An infection in the pulp can progress to form an abscess. Sometimes a periapical abscess develops if the nerve to the tooth dies for any reason. For example, from injury. The dead tissue inside a tooth is more prone to infection.
Periodontal abscess
This type of abscess starts in the supporting structures of the teeth, such as the periodontium which is between the tooth and the gum. It most commonly develops as a complication of gum disease (periodontal disease), which is infection or inflammation of the tissues that surround the teeth.
Gum disease often causes the gum to become slightly detached from the tooth. This causes pockets to form which may get filled with bacteria and progress to form an abscess. A periodontal abscess may also develop as a complication of injury to the gums or periodontium. A periodontal abscess is sometimes called a gum boil as the abscess causes a swelling to develop next to a tooth.

Dental abscess symptoms
Symptoms typically include one or more of the following:
Pain (toothache) which can quickly become worse. It can be severe and throbbing.

Dental abscess treatment
Initial treatment
See a dentist as soon as possible. A dentist will normally drain the pus and this often gives great relief of symptoms. This is done either by piercing (lancing) the abscess or by drilling a small hole in the tooth to let the pus escape.
Sometimes, if the infection is not contained, an antibiotic medicine is prescribed for a few days after draining the pus to clear any remaining infection. However, in most cases an antibiotic is probably not needed once the pus is drained. A GP cannot make the decision as to whether an antibiotic is appropriate, and should not prescribe antibiotics for this - it has to be a dentist.
Further treatment
Other treatment for a dental abscess includes the following:
Root canal
Root canal treatment is normally given to treat a periapical abscess. This treatment aims to save and restore the damaged or dead inner part of a tooth (the pulp). Briefly - a dentist will drill into the dead tooth and allow pus to escape through the tooth, and then remove the dead pulpal tissue.
A root filling is then placed into the tooth to fill the space and prevent further infection. (Note: even if pain has gone with an initial emergency drainage of the pus, you are still likely to need root canal treatment. This is because the infection and abscess will almost certainly return unless the dead pulp tissue is dealt with.)
If the infection persists despite root canal treatment, the dentist may have to remove (extract) the tooth.
Draining the abscess
For a periodontal abscess the pus is usually drained. A dentist may also clean the pocket where the abscess had formed. Following this a dentist may smooth out the root surfaces of the tooth to encourage the gum to close back on to the tooth and for any pocket to disappear.
This helps to prevent a recurrence of infection. If you develop repeated periodontal abscesses you may be referred to an oral surgeon. The oral surgeon may carry out a procedure to reshape the gum tissue.
Do you need to see a doctor?
Your GP cannot do anything to help apart from recommend painkillers, which can be bought over the counter. Primary care in the UK is under unprecedented pressure and you should not ring your GP for dental problems, because it takes up a phone call or face to face appointment which could have gone to someone who the GP can help.
You may need painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen until the abscess is drained and treated. These are both available over the counter. (Note: paracetamol and ibuprofen can be taken together if pain relief with either alone is not enough. Some people require stronger painkillers prescribed by a dentist)
Dental abscess causes
Dental abscesses may occur because a tooth has not properly grown out of the gum (is impacted), because there is tooth decay or gum disease, or because of an injury to the teeth, gums or mouth. They may be more common in those who are having radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
Complications of a dental abscess
Other complications are uncommon. However, they can be serious, even fatal in rare situations, for example, if the infection has spread. They include:
Osteomyelitis - an infection of the nearby bone.
Osteomyelitis - an infection of the nearby bone.
Sinusitis - spread of infection to the nearby sinus in the face bone.
Sinusitis - spread of infection to the nearby sinus in the face bone.

A serious, potentially life-threatening infection of the floor of the mouth. This could spread to the face, brain or neck (symptoms of serious infection are listed below).
So, the take home message is - if you have a dental abscess then you should have it treated. This is not only to relieve pain but to prevent possible serious complications. Symptoms that may indicate that a complication is developing and where you should seek medical help urgently are:
If you feel very unwell with a high temperature.

People with sickle cell anaemia (not sickle cell trait).

Outlook
If treated, the outlook (prognosis) is good. The pus can usually be drained and the tooth can be saved if it is not badly broken down. If left untreated, the abscess may burst on to the skin of the face or into the mouth. This may leave a channel (a sinus tract) between a persistent focus of infection and the skin or mouth, which can discharge pus from time to time.
Preventing a dental abscess
Most dental abscesses are preventable, as most are a complication of tooth decay or gum disease. Both of these can be prevented with good oral hygiene. Briefly, this means regularly brushing your teeth and flossing.
Other things that may help include:
Using mouthwash.

Common causes of bad breath
Halitosis is the medical name for bad breath. It describes an unpleasant smell in the breath which is detectable by other people.

How to get rid of halitosis
Most of us worry about having bad breath at some point. While it's not dangerous, it is embarrassing, especially as as we get used to our own odours and often don't know we have it.
What is halitosis?
Halitosis (bad breath) means that you have an unpleasant smell on your breath that other people notice when you speak or breathe out.
The exact number of people with halitosis is not known, but it is common. In some countries, studies have found as many as half of the population have problems with halitosis. In others the frequency is much less.
Types of halitosis
Halitosis can be:
Normal
Halitosis can be normal (physiological) in certain circumstances. This includes:
In the morning when you first wake up (morning breath).

Fasting, being on a crash diet or a low-carbohydrate diet.
Pathological
This means there is a problem causing it. This is usually a problem in the mouth, but it can be coming from other sources, or caused by a specific illness or medical condition.
Psychological (Halitophobia)
In this case, the person doesn't actually have halitosis. Nobody else can smell it but the person becomes very anxious about it. An extreme version of this is called halitophobia, the fear of bad breath. Some people think they have bad breath when they do not, and nobody else can smell it. This can result in odd behaviour to try to minimise what they think of as their halitosis. For example, they may cover their mouth when talking, avoid or keep a distance from other people, or avoid social occasions. People with halitophobia often become fixated with teeth cleaning and tongue cleaning and frequently use chewing gums, mints, mouthwashes and sprays in the hope of reducing their distress. Treatment from a psychologist may help.
What causes halitosis?

How can you tell if you have halitosis?
A main problem with halitosis (bad breath) is that often the only person not to notice it is the person affected. You become used to your own smell and do not tend to notice your own bad breath.
Often, the only way to know about it is if a person comments on it. However, most people are too polite to comment on another person's bad breath. You may have to rely on a family member or a close friend to be honest and tell you if you have bad breath.
Perhaps you could ask your dentist next time you have a check-up. A dentist will normally be able to say if you have bad breath. Gum disease is a common cause of halitosis and a dentist will be able to advise on treatment if you have gum disease.
Some people suggest a simple test which you can do yourself to detect bad breath. Lick the inside of your wrist. Wait a few seconds for the saliva to dry. Then smell the licked part of the wrist. If you detect an unpleasant smell, you are likely to have bad breath.
When to seek further help
If you have done everything you can in terms of the oral hygiene measures discussed in this leaflet and still have halitosis then see a dentist first, and then your doctors if the dentist does not identify any problems. You should also see a doctor if you have bad breath associated with other symptoms, such as acid reflux or sinus pain.
Who should I consult about halitosis?
You can see either a doctor or a dentist. Usually a dentist would be the first port of call, as they can do a thorough check of your teeth and gums, which are the most common source of the problem. If the dentist can't find a cause in your mouth, he or she may suggest you consult a doctor.
Will I need any tests?
For most people this won't be necessary. You would have an examination of your mouth by your dentist. In some cases the dentist may suggest an X-ray to look further at your teeth. Your doctor may ask about other symptoms and examine you to look for other causes if the dentist cannot find a cause. If this is the case, you may need some tests to assess if you have a less common cause of halitosis. This might include:
Blood tests.

How to get rid of halitosis
Good oral hygiene
This means regularly and effectively brushing your teeth, including and cleaning between teeth.
These routine daily procedures are usually sufficient to look after your teeth and to treat or prevent halitosis. However, if you still have bad breath coming from your mouth then the following extra measures may help cure the problem.
Mouthwashes
Consider using a mouthwash each day. Chemicals in the mouthwash aim to kill germs (bacteria) and/or neutralise any chemicals that cause halitosis. It is difficult to advise on which mouthwash is the most effective. A number of clinical trials have shown that various ingredients are good at reducing bad breath. These include chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorine dioxide, zinc chloride and triclosan. The various mouthwashes that you can buy usually contain one or more of these ingredients, plus various other ingredients.
Note: some people are reluctant to use a chlorhexidine-containing mouthwash long-term. This is because it has a bad taste, can give rise to a burning sensation in the mouth if used too frequently, and can cause (reversible) staining of the teeth or occasionally some temporary darkening of the tongue. Also, some mouthwashes contain alcohol as one of their ingredients. There is some concern that long-term use of alcohol-containing mouthwashes may be a risk factor in the development of mouth cancer. Also, young children should not use a mouthwash if they may swallow it.
Tongue cleaning
Consider cleaning the back of your tongue each day. Some people do this with a soft toothbrush dipped in mouthwash (not toothpaste). An easier and better way is to buy a special plastic tongue scraper from a pharmacy. You need to place it as far back as you can and then gently scrape forward to clear the tongue of any coating. Some studies suggest that tongue scrapers or cleaners are slightly more effective than toothbrushes as a means of controlling halitosis.
Chewing gum
Some people chew sugar-free gum after each meal. It is not clear how well gum helps to reduce bad breath but chewing gum increases the production of saliva. Saliva helps to flush the mouth to help clear any debris remaining from the meal.
Food and drink
Sugars and sugary foods in the mouth are the main foods that germs (bacteria) thrive on to make acid which can contribute to tooth decay. Acidic foods and drinks are also a main factor in tooth erosion. So, some tips:
Limit the amount of sugary foods and drinks that you have. In particular, don't snack on sugary foods.
Limit the amount of sugary foods and drinks that you have. In particular, don't snack on sugary foods.
Try to reduce the amount of acid in contact with your teeth. So, limit fizzy drinks (including fizzy water) and fruit juices, as these tend to be acidic. Perhaps just limit yourself to one fizzy or fruit juice drink a day. Otherwise, choose drinks that are much less acidic, such as still water, and milk, tea, or coffee (without sugar).

Stop smoking
If you smoke, try to stop. Smoking or using other oral tobacco products increases the risk of developing gum disease as well as causing halitosis because of chemicals left in the mouth.
If you have dentures and have halitosis
You may not be cleaning them properly. Ask your dentist for advice on cleaning dentures.
What treatment will I need if the halitosis doesn't go away?
This will naturally depend on the cause. For example, if it turns out you have nasal polyps, you might be prescribed a steroid nasal spray, or have an operation. If you have acid reflux, you may prescribed medicines such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). You may be prescribed antibiotics if you have an infection, etc.
What's good oral hygiene?
The main treatment of halitosis coming from within the mouth is good oral hygiene. Aim to get into a regular habit of good oral hygiene - in particular, teeth brushing and cleaning between teeth.
Teeth brushing
Brush your teeth at least twice a day.

Ideally, brush your teeth either just before eating, or at least an hour after eating. The reason for this is to help prevent tooth erosion. Many foods contain acids. In particular, fizzy drinks (including fizzy water) and fruit juices. After your teeth are exposed to acid, the enamel is a little softened. But, the action of calcium and other mineral salts in the saliva can help to counteract and reverse this softening. Therefore, do not brush teeth immediately after eating when the enamel tends to be at its softest; in particular, after eating or drinking acidic foods and drinks. It is best to wait at least an hour after eating or drinking anything before brushing.
Cleaning between teeth
Clean between your teeth after brushing once a day, but ideally twice a day. This is to remove plaque from between teeth. Dental floss is commonly used to do this. It may be that small interdental brushes are more effective, but studies have not yet shown this convincingly. The aim is to clean the sides of the teeth where a toothbrush cannot reach. Also, to clear the spaces between teeth (the interdental spaces) of debris. Some people who have not cleaned between their teeth before are surprised as to how much extra debris and food particles can be removed by doing this in addition to brushing.
If you are not sure how to clean between your teeth then ask your dentist or dental hygienist. Briefly: normal floss looks a bit like cotton thread. Cut off about 40 cm. Wind the ends round your middle fingers of each hand. Then grab the floss between the thumbs and first finger to obtain a tight 3-4 cm section which you can pull between teeth. Gently scrape the floss against the sides of each tooth from the gum outwards. Use a fresh piece of floss each time.
Some people prefer floss tape which slides between teeth more easily than normal floss. Also, some people use disposable plastic forks with a small length of floss between the two prongs. These may be easier to hold and manipulate. However, they are expensive. Some people use sticks, or small interdental brushes to clean the space between the teeth.
The gums may bleed a little when you start to clean between your teeth. This should settle in a few days. If it persists, see a dentist, as regular bleeding may indicate gum disease.
Have regular dental checks at intervals recommended by your dentist (normally at least once a year). A dentist can detect build-up of plaque and remove tartar (calculus). Early gum disease can be detected and treated to prevent it from getting worse.

Dental plaque and gum disease
Toothache is a painful sensation that comes from the teeth or the tissues that surround them. It is caused by inflammation of the dental pulp - the nerves and blood vessels inside our teeth. When the pulp becomes inflamed, this is called 'pulpitis'.

What else might it be?
Anybody who has experienced severe toothache knows that the pain can be excruciating. It is described by many people as the worst pain they have ever experienced. This explains why toothache remains the most common reason for emergency dental attendance and is a frequent reason for absence from work or school.
Are toothaches common?
Toothache can affect adults and children of almost any age. To help your teeth remain healthy and pain-free it is important that you maintain an effective daily dental hygiene regime. Children's teeth should be cared for in a similar fashion as soon as they break through the gums.
Oral and dental care
When it comes to our teeth, many of us feel insecure about our not-so-pearly whites. If you're looking for a brighter smile, you might be exploring teeth whitening options. But is there anything we should know about the safety of teeth whitening?

Oral and dental care
Tooth decay (dental caries) is the destruction of tooth tissue by the action of cariogenic bacteria. These are germs that cause dental caries.

What causes toothache?
A tooth is made of three layers:
Enamel: the hard outer layer of teeth above the gum.

The dentine is made of a densely packed set of microscopic tubes leading from the enamel to the pulp. If the dentine loses its protective covering of enamel then harmful substances like germs, toxins and hot, cold or sweet stimuli are able to pass along the tubes of the dentine. They can then exert a damaging and painful effect on the living pulp underneath.
The pulp responds to these harmful stimuli by becoming inflamed (this is called pulpitis) as it tries to repair and defend itself.
There are two types of pulpitis:
Reversible pulpitis
In reversible pulpitis, the damage to the pulp is not extensive and has the potential to heal if the broken tooth receives appropriate dental treatment.
Irreversible pulpitis
In irreversible pulpitis, the inflammation and damage within the pulp is too extensive for the pulp to survive even with prompt dental treatment.
Tooth decay
Tooth decay (dental caries) is the most common cause of pulpitis. When we eat sugary food and drinks, the bacteria in our mouths consume the sugar and release acid. Over time the acid can dissolve a hole in the enamel layer of our teeth which allows the bacteria and their toxins to enter the softer layer of dentine and pass through it to irritate the pulp.
Side-effects of pulpitis
A side-effect of pulpitis is an increase in blood pressure around the nerves within the pulp. In cases of irreversible pulpitis the raised pressure inside the tooth limits the amount of blood that can enter the tooth. Without sufficient blood entering the tooth, the pulp will die painfully due to a lack of oxygen.
What else causes pulpitis?
Apart from tooth decay, other possible causes of pulpitis include:
Loose, leaking, lost or broken fillings.

Gum wear, called 'recession'. This is caused by brushing too hard when brushing your teeth which exposes the sensitive dentine of the tooth root.

To understand the effect of temperature on the pulp, think about the sensation of biting into ice cream. When the dentine is exposed, sweet things and room temperature drinks can feel like ice cream sensitivity.
What else might the toothache be?
The following conditions may feel like toothache but do not actually involve the pulp:
Periodontal infections
These are infections which develop in the space between the tooth and gums. If you have gum disease, you are likely to have deeper spaces, called pockets, between the gums and teeth. Germs can multiply in these pockets and cause infections which may be painful and lead to bone loss.
Pericoronitis
This is an infection around a partially erupted tooth. Any tooth can be affected but most frequently it is the wisdom teeth. Your dentist will usually clean around the affected area to remove food and bacteria. You may need painkillers and antibiotics if the infection shows signs that it is spreading to other areas.
Trauma
Biting on an unexpected hard piece of food can cause the bone and ligaments around teeth to become bruised and painful to bite on to for several days. A soft diet and avoiding chewing on the tender teeth for a day or two usually resolve this problem.
Sinusitis
With sinusitis, the roots of upper teeth can be closely related to the air spaces - sinuses - in the upper jaw on either side of the nose. If there is a sinus infection or the sinuses become inflamed the increased pressure can push on the tooth nerves as they enter the root tip. This causes pain that feels like pulpitis. Over-the-counter decongestants may reduce the symptoms.
What are the symptoms of toothache?
The symptoms of toothache are frequently confusing. It can be difficult to decide which tooth is causing the pain or even whether it's coming from an upper or a lower tooth. Sometimes the pain can feel like it is coming from a distant site, like your ear for example. This is called referred pain.
The most common symptoms of toothache are:
Pain
Understanding the type of pain can help the dentist to treat you more effectively.
Is it a sharp shooting pain or a dull ache?

Does the pain last for a few seconds or half an hour?
Does the pain last for a few seconds or half an hour?
Does anything make the pain worse or make it go away?
Does anything make the pain worse or make it go away?
The longer each episode of pain lasts, the more serious the condition is likely to be.
Hypersensitivity
Teeth with mild-to-moderate reversible pulpitis are usually more sensitive to cold or sweet food and drinks but rarely to hot ones.
Teeth with irreversible pulpitis are initially sensitive to cold but as the condition worsens the pulp becomes increasingly sensitive to hot things. Eventually, cold drinks can actually help to reduce the severe throbbing pain. This is because the cold temperature helps to reduce the pressure and inflammation inside the pulp, similar to an ice pack on a twisted knee or ankle.
Tenderness to pressure (TTP)
The more painful a tooth is to bite on, the more severe the pulpitis is likely to be. A tooth with reversible pulpitis might have no TTP at all. As the inflammation worsens to an irreversible pulpitis, the effects will spread beyond the root into the bone and make the tooth painful to bite on to. This makes teeth with irreversible pulpitis much easier to identify.
Pain on biting or pushing the side of a tooth can also indicate the presence of an infection spreading from the gums down the side of a tooth. It could also be due to inflammation or bruising around the tooth root if it has been knocked in an accident.
Inability to sleep
If your sleep is affected by toothache then it is likely you have irreversible pulpitis, especially if you are woken up in the middle of the night with a throbbing toothache that can last for hours.
If you experience any of these symptoms for more than a day or two without any reduction in severity, arrange to see your dentist as soon as possible. If you delay, the pain is likely to get worse.
How is toothache diagnosed?
Before starting any treatment your dentist will need to make sure that the source of your pain has been correctly identified. The first step is asking about the history of your toothache.
The questions might include:
How long have you had toothache?
How long have you had toothache?
How long does each episode of pain last?

Are there any special tests for toothache?
Next, your dentist will examine your teeth and carry out some tests to gather more information.
Percussion testing
This is usually performed by tapping gently on teeth with a dental mirror handle and pushing on various teeth to identify which ones feel normal, a bit tender or very tender.
Vitality testing
This aims to identify if a pulp is healthy, inflamed or dead by placing hot or cold pieces of cotton wool against individual teeth. If a tooth feels the temperature difference, the pulp is alive or vital. An exaggerated response indicates the nerve may have pulpitis. A negative response implies the pulp may be dead. A pen-shaped device called an electric pulp tester can also be used to test if a pulp is alive.
X-rays
These can provide useful information about the presence and extent of tooth decay (dental caries), root fractures, the shape and depth of fillings, the presence of infections or abscesses around the roots of teeth and the proximity of teeth to the sinuses, nerves and other structures.
Testing for cracks
You will be asked to bite down repeatedly on to a plastic wedge-shaped instrument to identify cracks in a tooth that might be too small for the dentist to see directly. Sometimes shining a bright light against the tooth can help to visualise a crack.
Assessing the health of your gums
Your dentist will carefully assess the health of the gums around the painful teeth to check for inflammation, infections and signs of periodontal disease.
When all the relevant information has been gathered, your dentist will discuss the likely causes for your pain and provide you with a list of treatment options.
How to get rid of toothache
What is the treatment for toothache?
Most people will just want the pain to stop. Although your first thought may be to phone your GP surgery, this is not the best thing to do. GPs and their teams are not trained for dental problems and are actively advised by the General Medical Council not to try to manage them. In an emergency you can phone NHS 111 for advice.
Treatment for reversible pulpitis involves protecting the pulp from whatever was causing it to become inflamed. This usually involves the removal of tooth decay (dental caries) or any damaged fillings, followed by the placement of a new filling.
If a dentist has doubts about the pulp's chances of recovery then a temporary filling might be appropriate. The status of the pulp can be reassessed after some time to ensure that it has healed before a permanent filling is placed. If the pulp has not healed or the symptoms have increased then your tooth may need to undergo treatment for irreversible pulpitis (see below)
If the pulpitis was caused by a crack in a tooth it may be necessary to modify the site of the crack before replacing a filling or a crown, to prevent the tooth cracking in half.
After placement of a filling, it may take several days for the symptoms of reversible pulpitis to subside. Your dentist will advise you how to prevent further pulp irritation while it is healing. They may also prescribe pain-relieving medication which may also help to reduce inflammation within the pulp.
If the pulpitis was caused by a previous deep filling or tooth sensitivity due to gum recession, your dentist will advise you how to protect the tooth and avoid irritating the pulp to give it a chance to heal by itself. Special varnishes and protective coatings might help to reduce the symptoms, along with pain relief (painkillers) if your dentist recommends them. See the separate leaflet called Painkillers.
How is irreversible pulpitis treated?
Treatment for irreversible pulpitis consists of two main options. The same options apply for a tooth with a pulp that has died due to tooth decay (dental caries) or trauma.
Root canal treatment
Root canal treatment involves removal of the dying pulp, disinfecting and shaping the space inside the tooth and placing a specialised root filling material to prevent further infection of the pulp space. This procedure is often carried out over two appointments approximately two weeks apart.
Extraction of the painful tooth
This option might be necessary if there is not enough of the tooth remaining, after decay removal, to support a filling.
How can I prevent toothache?
The best way to avoid toothache is by attending routine dental appointments , brushing your teeth with fluoride toothpaste, maintaining a careful oral hygiene routine and reducing your intake of sugary foods and drinks that cause tooth decay (dental caries). For detailed oral hygiene and diet advice, speak to a member of your dental team.
Can toothache go away on its own?
If you delay seeing a dentist for too long then you will increase the likelihood of significant pulp damage. This is usually extremely painful and eating and drinking will become much more uncomfortable as the pulpitis spreads to affect the bone and ligament around the root tip. This can lead to severe, constant pain and sleepless nights. Without treatment, the pulp will eventually die and break down to form a dental abscess in the bone around the root of the tooth. When this happens, the dentist is left with only two options: root canal treatment or tooth extraction.
What else might it be?
Several other dental pain conditions have symptoms which may be confused with toothache but do not actually involve the pulp. These include sinusitis, mouth ulcers and gum infections, especially if you have partially erupted wisdom teeth or have gum disease.
