i am in a real fix,my blood pressure is sky rocketing in late afternoon and through the evening ,I am on a blood thinner,but it’s terrifying to see your blood pressure soaring when only lying down,I t ake 2 50mg of losarton but they don’t do any damn thing,now I am driving to the hospital every.night and trying to sleep in the car,I live alone and feel safer at the hospital if I get ill,but all this stress is depressing me,whT on earth could I do
