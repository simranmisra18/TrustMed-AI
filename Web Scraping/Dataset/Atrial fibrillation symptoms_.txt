I have been experiencing light headness and weak legs as well as general unwellness for four months now ever since I had a campylobacter infection. I have had a two week heart monitor which apparently indicates some degree of atrial fibrillation and I have been hospitalized once over night after fainting. I am now waiting for a cardiology appointment but in the meantime time, does anyone know if there is anything I can do or take to alleviate the horrible feelings I have on a daily basis? Some days are better than others but I never feel completely well. Any advice would be much appreciated!
