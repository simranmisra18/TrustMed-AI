Hi all,
Looking for a bit of advice please. My heart rate can quickly rise then drop just as quick like today, I was down the river with my son and my heart rate went to 175bpm and l didn’t feel anything just saw it on my watch/phone app. This has has happened a few times in the past but not this high. I had an ecg last week and all was fine, my blood pressure was fine but have slight hypothyroidism. Any advice would be greatly appreciated as this is stressing me out.
