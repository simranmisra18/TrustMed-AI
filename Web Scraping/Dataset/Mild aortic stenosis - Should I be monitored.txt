went into a&e as i wasn’t well and they picked up a heart mumur. i had an echocardiogram in September and when i finally got hold of the cardiologist who read he said everything was normal. I asked for a copy of the report to see for myself and it said mild aortic stenosis. I wouldn’t say thats normal? Should I have be referred to a cardiologist to at least be monitored?? The cardiologist who read it is from a&e and they said he don’t actually work up the hospital
