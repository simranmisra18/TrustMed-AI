i had my third cardioversion in Nov 2020 which was successful and i gave up drinking as it is my trigger. Over the last few weeks i have had the odd palpitations and did so this time last year i had the same thing which i then had a holter monitor fitted which when the results came back showed nothing odd and the doctor just put it down to anxiety. As they are back and i had one today that lasted around 15 seconds i am wondering if my heart os on its way back to not being in sinus rhythm much longer . The thing is i have noticed i seem to get them a couple of hours after drinking coffee so not sure if caffeine is giving me the warning signs. Has anyone else experienced similar?
