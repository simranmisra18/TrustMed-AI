Vitamin D deficiency happens when your body does not have enough vitamin D, a nutrient that helps keep bones, teeth, and muscles healthy. It is common, especially in people who get little sunlight or have low dietary intake. Without enough vitamin D, bones can become weak, soft, or painful. This leaflet explains what causes it, what it means for your health, and what you can do to prevent and treat it.

Key points
Vitamin D is essential for bone and muscle function. A deficiency increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures in adults, and can cause rickets (soft, deformed bones) in children. It also supports the immune and nervous systems.

What is vitamin D deficiency?
Vitamin D deficiency means that there is a lack of vitamin D in your body to stay healthy. Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium and phosphorus from your gut (bowel) which is essential for healthy bones and to let your muscles function properly.
The main source of Vitamin D is sunlight, you can also get it from foods - particularly fortified ones - and vitamin D supplements.
Vitamin D is converted to an active form in the liver and kidneys. Some types of liver and kidney disease can affect the way the body handles vitamin D, and so can also cause vitamin D deficiency.
Vitamin D also plays a role in the nervous system and immune system.
Why is vitamin D important?
Getting enough vitamin D is crucial for healthy bones and teeth. In children, being deficient in vitamin D can lead to a condition called rickets, where the bones are weak and soft and can become deformed (for example, with bow legs). In adults, low levels of vitamin D can increase the risk of osteoporosis, or thinning of the bones. This increases the risks of breaking a bone.
Vitamin D may also play a role in:

How much vitamin D do I need a day?
Due to a lack of sunlight, it is recommended that everyone in the UK over 1 year old take 10 micrograms (400 International Units) a day from October to March.
Certain groups of people are at higher risk of low vitamin D. It's advised that people take a vitamin D supplement of 10 micrograms (400 International Units) a day all year round if they:

In addition, specialists may advise taking a supplement all year round for people with particular gut (bowel), kidney or liver diseases.
Babies from birth to 1 year old should have a supplement in the form of vitamin D drops of 8.5 to 10 micrograms a day. Babies having 500 ml or more of formula milk per day do not need supplements, as formula milk already has vitamin D added.
Where can I buy vitamin D supplements?
Vitamin D dietary supplements can be bought at pharmacies, supermarkets and online retailers. In the UK they are available on prescription to certain groups of people (usually those needing high doses, for example, with severe chronic kidney disease).
Vitamin D deficiency symptoms
Many people don’t notice any symptoms of vitamin D deficiency, or they might just feel a bit tired or achy. In children, however, signs are usually easier to spot.
Vitamin D deficiency symptoms in babies
Babies with severe vitamin D deficiency can get:
Cramps (muscle spasms).

These problems are related to low levels of calcium which result from the low levels of vitamin D.
Vitamin D deficiency symptoms in children
Children with severe vitamin D deficiency may have soft skull or leg bones. Their legs may look curved (bow-legged). They may also complain of bone pains, often in the legs, and muscle pains or muscle weakness. This condition is known as rickets.

What causes vitamin D deficiency?
A vitamin D deficiency may happen because the body:

Growing children, pregnant women, and breastfeeding women need extra vitamin D because it is required for growth. So, vitamin D deficiency is more likely to develop in the following groups of people:
Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Vitamin D deficiency is even more likely to develop in women who have had several babies with short gaps between pregnancies.

Breastfed babies whose mothers are lacking in vitamin D, or with prolonged breastfeeding, as there is little vitamin D in breast milk.
The body is unable to make enough vitamin D
This can occur for various reasons:
People who get very little sunlight on their skin are at risk of vitamin D deficiency. This is more of a problem in the more northerly parts of the world (including the UK) where there is less sun. In particular:
People who stay inside a lot, for example, those in hospital for a long time, or housebound people.
People who cover up a lot of their body when outside.
The strict use of sunscreen could increase the risk of vitamin D deficiency, particularly if high sun protection factor (SPF) creams (factor 15 or above) are used. However, this is a theoretical risk and there is no evidence that the normal use of sunscreen does actually cause vitamin D deficiency in real life. Everyone, especially children, should always be protected from the harmful effect of the sun's rays. See the separate leaflet called Sun and sunburn for more information.

Rarely, some people without any other risk factors or diseases become deficient in vitamin D. It is not clear why this occurs. It may be due to a subtle metabolic problem in the way vitamin D is made or absorbed. So, even some otherwise healthy, fair-skinned people who get enough sun exposure can become deficient in vitamin D.

Not enough dietary vitamin D
Vitamin D deficiency is more likely to occur in people who follow a strict vegetarian or vegan diet, or a non-fish-eating diet.
How common is vitamin D deficiency?
A lack of vitamin D is very common. One survey in the UK showed that about 1 in 5 adults and about 1 in 5 children in the UK have low vitamin D levels. More people have low vitamin D levels in the winter and spring because of less exposure to sunlight.
How is vitamin D deficiency diagnosed?
It may be suspected from someone's medical history, symptoms, or lifestyle. A simple blood test for vitamin D level can make the diagnosis. Blood tests for calcium and phosphate levels and liver function may also show changes linked to a low level of vitamin D.
Sometimes a wrist X-ray is done for a child in order to see how the bones are developing. This can assess how severe the problem is by looking for changes in the wrist bones. This is when vitamin D deficiency has already been identified and specialists are assessing its impact.
Vitamin D deficiency treatment
The main treatment is to take vitamin D supplements. This is a form of vitamin D called ergocalciferol or calciferol. The dose and the best treatment schedule will depend on the situation, age, severity of the deficiency, etc. Briefly, one of the following may be advised.
High-dose tablets or liquids
There are different strengths available and a dose may be taken either daily, weekly or monthly. This will depend on the situation and on which particular treatment guideline is being used. This high dose may often be temporary to increase the levels to normal and they can then be kept at this level with over-the-counter supplements.
Because vitamin D is a 'fat-soluble' vitamin, your body can store it, so you do not need to take it every day. This is different from water-soluble vitamins such as vitamin C, which you need to consume every day.
With high doses of vitamin D it is even more important to take the medicine correctly. The advantage of the higher-dose treatment is that the deficiency improves quickly, which is very important in growing children or people who have very low levels.
Standard-dose tablets or liquids
These are taken every day for about 12 months so that the body can catch up on the missing vitamin D. This is a rather slow method of replacing vitamin D, but is suitable for prevention.
Injection
A single small injection of vitamin D will last for about six months. This was previously used but is less so nowadays as there are increased risks of side effects, toxicity and tachyphylaxis (where the individual feels the need for more and more vitamin, even though their levels are normal).
Maintenance therapy
Once vitamin D deficiency has been treated, the body's stores of vitamin D have been replenished. After this, ongoing maintenance treatment is often needed long-term, to prevent further deficiency in the future.
This is because it is unlikely that any risk factor for vitamin D deficiency in the first place will have completely resolved. The dose needed for maintenance may be lower than that needed to treat the deficiency.
How to get vitamin D naturally
For people with fair skin, around 20-30 minutes of sunlight on the face and forearms around the middle of the day, 2-3 times a week is enough to make enough vitamin D in the summer months in the UK. The sunlight has to fall directly on to bare skin (through a window is not enough).
People with darker skin can still make some vitamin D through exposure to sunshine. However, they may not be able to make enough from sunshine and diet alone so should consider taking a vitamin D supplement all year round.
Too much exposure to the sun's rays can be damaging. Sunburn should be avoided at all costs (mainly because it can increase the risk of skin cancer).
Vitamin D can also be obtained from foods that either contain it naturally or have it added to them.
What foods contain vitamin D?
Most foods contain very little vitamin D naturally. Foods that naturally contain a source of vitamin D include:
Oily fish (such as sardines, pilchards, herring, trout, tuna, salmon, mackerel and kippers).

Egg yolk, red meat and liver.

Cod liver oil (although this should be avoided if you're pregnant).
Some foods are fortified with vitamin D (this means they have vitamin D added to them). These fortified foods include infant formula milk, most margarines and some cereals. It will be stated on the packaging.
In some countries (but not in the UK) all milk is fortified with vitamin D.
Are there any risks to taking vitamin D supplements?
Care is needed with vitamin D supplements in certain situations:
It can interact with certain medicines: digoxin (for an irregular heartbeat - atrial fibrillation) or thiazide diuretics such as bendroflumethiazide (commonly used to treat high blood pressure). In this situation, high doses of vitamin D may need to be avoided, and digoxin will need monitoring more closely.

A higher-than-usual dose might be needed if taking certain medicines which interfere with vitamin D. These include: carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, barbiturates and some medicines for the treatment of HIV infection.
Multivitamins are not suitable for long-term high-dose treatment because the vitamin A they also contain can be harmful in large amounts.
Complications of vitamin D deficiency
The complications of severe deficiency have been mentioned. Rickets can occur in children, and osteomalacia (softening of the bones) in adults. These diseases affect the strength and appearance of bones, and can lead to permanent bone deformities if untreated or if treatment is delayed.
As well as bone and muscle health, vitamin D deficiency is associated with a number of different conditions. These conditions include:
Diabetes.

Coronary heart disease.

Breast cancer.

Bowel cancer.

Alzheimer's disease.

The exact significance of these associations isn't yet properly understood.
What is the outlook?
The outlook (prognosis) of vitamin D deficiency is usually excellent. Both the vitamin levels and the symptoms usually respond well to treatment. However, it can take time (months) for bones to recover and for symptoms such as pain to improve.
Frequently asked questions
How long does it take to correct a vitamin D deficiency?
It usually takes a few weeks to several months to correct vitamin D deficiency, depending on how low your levels are, the dosage of supplements, and how consistently you take them.
Can you take too much vitamin D?
Taking more than the recommended daily amount of 10 micrograms (400 IU) can lead to vitamin D toxicity, which may cause high calcium levels, nausea, weakness, kidney problems, and other health issues. Always follow guidelines and seek medical advice before taking high doses.
Can I take vitamin D all year round?
Vitamin D supplements are generally safe to take year-round, especially if you don’t get enough from sunlight or diet. Most people benefit from a daily maintenance dose, but it’s best to follow official guidelines or your doctor’s advice to avoid taking too much.
Does a lack of vitamin D cause depression?
Low vitamin D has been linked to low mood and depression as the vitamin supports brain function and mood regulation. Whilst not everyone with a deficiency develops depression, maintaining healthy levels through sunlight, diet, or supplements may help support mental wellbeing.

Back pain in children
Thoracic back pain is pain that occurs in the thoracic spine. The thoracic spine is located at the back of the chest (the thorax), mostly between the shoulder blades. It extends from the bottom of the neck to the start of the lumbar spine, roughly at the level of the waist.

Thoracic back pain symptoms
Thoracic spine pain is a relatively common symptom but does not tend to persist for long. Often, people will say this type of pain feels as if someone is stabbing them in the back. It is the least common type of back pain but it is more likely than neck pain or low back pain to have a serious cause.
Thoracic back pain red flag symptoms
Thoracic spine pain is usually not sinister and is usually of little consequence. However there are some more concerning features to look out for:

It shouldn't be assumed that all pain in the thoracic spine is coming from the spine itself. Other causes of pain in this area can include problems affecting the lung, the uppermost part of the gut (the oesophagus), the stomach, the gallbladder and the pancreas.
How common is thoracic back pain?
Surveys to find out how many people have thoracic spine pain produce very variable results. Evidence from studies suggest that between 15 and 35 in 100 people report having had thoracic back pain at some time. It appears to be as common in children and teenagers as it is in adults and is more common in girls.
Mental health problems seem to be an associated factor as does poor posture. . Adults with thoracic back pain often have aches and pains elsewhere.
Is thoracic back pain serious?
Usually there is not a serious cause for thoracic back pain. Most people with thoracic spine pain get better without treatment in a couple of weeks.
However, thoracic back pain is more likely to be due to a serious cause than pain in other areas of the spine (cervical or lumbar spine). There is a whole list of things to look out for that might indicate there's a problem (as listed above).
Diagnosing thoracic back pain
A short-lived mild pain with an obvious explanation should initially be managed with simple painkillers (such as paracetamol or ibuprofen which can be bought over the counter) and rest / gentle exercise.
However, because thoracic back pain has a higher chance of having a serious cause than neck or lower back pain, a clinician is likely to suggest tests if the pain persists, is severe or is accompanied by any of the 'red flag' features mentioned above.
The tests will depend on the conditions that the clinician wants to assess. They are likely to include blood tests such as a full blood count and inflammatory markers, an x-ray if there is a suspicion of a fracture of one of the vertebrae and maybe a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.
Thoracic back pain treatment
Most cases will settle without any specific treatment. Simple painkillers and gentle exercise will normally help. If there is an underlying cause, this will need treatment depending on the cause.
Medical treatment
If the pain is coming from a joint in the spine (a facet joint) this may be helped by an injection performed under X-ray vision (imaging-guided intra-articular injection).
Surgery which opens the covering of the spinal canal (a procedure called laminectomy) to treat a slipped disc causing thoracic spine pain is occasionally used.
Muscle relaxants used to be suggested for back pain with acute muscle spasm, but there is little evidence for their benefit and they often have side effects and can be addictive, so they are not generally recommended now.
Physiotherapy can be very useful if the pains are not settling.
Self-help treatment
The following can help to reduce and manage thoracic back pain:

Preventing thoracic back pain
Thoracic back pain may be caused by an underlying condition. The commonest of these would be a "compression fracture" of a vertebra (where one of the vertebrae gets squashed by the vertebra above it and fractures) which is usually caused by osteoporosis. The best way to prevent osteoporosis is by doing regular weight-bearing exercise (several times a week) and ensuring adequate dietary intake of calcium, as well as not smoking or drinking excess alcohol.
Most commonly, thoracic back pain is simple pain due to muscle strain or inflammation. The best way of preventing this is regular exercise, such as walking or swimming. If the exercise is more vigorous then it is important to do warm up and cool down exercises to reduce the risk of problems. People who do exercises such as weight-lifting should be assessed to ensure they are doing the exercises correctly and safely.
Thoracic back pain can be caused by poor posture, or sitting for long periods, for example, at a desk - avoiding these, and ensuring a desk workstation is ergonomic, can help to prevent it.
Children and adolescents should ensure that they are not wearing backpacks to school which are too heavy. They should also be encouraged to sit with good posture, particularly when using computers or gaming devices.
What is the outlook for thoracic back pain?
The outlook (prognosis) depends on the underlying cause, age and general fitness.
Most cases settle down within a few weeks.

Meets Patient’s editorial guidelines
Broken or bruised ribs occur when there is a force to the chest such as from a fall, road accident or assault. The force from severe coughing, straining, or heavy sports can also cause rib injury. The symptoms may include pain when coughing, laughing or sneezing, and swelling around the ribs. A bruised rib usually heals itself in 2-3 weeks; pain killers may help with the symptoms. Complications can occur if internal organs are damaged by the sharp end of a broken rib.
If you are feeling breathless or unable to catch your breath - call for an emergency ambulance immediately (999 in the UK).

Frequently asked questions
What are rib injuries?
Rib injuries include bruising a rib or the muscles surrounding or between the ribs. They also include rib fractures- a break in one or more of the rib bones.
Children and babies are less likely to break ribs because their bones are more elastic. So, if a young child or baby has a rib fracture, it is very important to know what caused the injury. If there is no clear cause, the possibility of child abuse should be considered.
How long do rib injuries take to heal?
Broken (fractured) or bruised ribs often heal in about six weeks. However, the recovery time may be longer, especially for displaced fractures (when the broken ends of the rib no longer line up with one another). It is unusual to have pain persisting beyond 3 months and medical advice should be sought in this case.
What do bruised or broken ribs feel like?
Ribs that are broken (fractured ribs) are usually:
Painful, particularly with movement, deep breaths, or coughing.

Tender when pressed.

Rib injuries usually heal themselves in a few weeks
How are broken or bruised ribs diagnosed?
Usually, a broken or bruised rib diagnosis is made from the details given to a doctor (history) plus an examination. The chest wall will usually be inspected for swelling, redness or bruising, examined for tenderness and the chest listened to with a stethoscope The diagnosis usually based on this. A chest X-ray is not required unless there are suspected complications (detailed below).
If a broken rib is suspected, the main purpose of a chest X-ray is to look for complications rather than to diagnose the fracture itself. X-rays are not used unless necessary because of the radiation involved and because the treatment is the same for both broken and bruised ribs. This especially applies to women who are, or who may be, pregnant.
How to treat broken or bruised ribs
The most important treatment is to have good pain relief
Good pain relief for broken or bruised ribs is important as it helps to enable normal breathing and coughing. Simply putting up with the pain is not a good idea, as it can lead to taking shallow breaths which increases the risk of developing chest infections. (See the 'Complications' section below) . Painkillers help to prevent these problems.
Effective and safe pain relief is especially important for people who are more prone to chest infections. This includes, for example, smokers and people with persistent (chronic) chest conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart failure.
What pain relief should I use?
Three types of painkillers can be used:
Paracetamol.
Paracetamol.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen or aspirin.

Strong painkillers containing codeine or dihydrocodeine.
Strong painkillers containing codeine or dihydrocodeine.
How should I take the painkillers?
For painful rib injuries, it is best to take painkillers regularly without waiting until the pain becomes severe. As the ribs heal, the dose of the painkillers should be reduced. General advice is:
For mild-to-moderate pain, take paracetamol.
For mild-to-moderate pain, take paracetamol.
For moderate-to-severe pain, take paracetamol OR codeine OR paracetamol plus an anti-inflammatory painkiller. You can take paracetamol and codeine together, but studies suggest the resulting pain relief is not much better than taking one or other alone.
For moderate-to-severe pain, take paracetamol OR codeine OR paracetamol plus an anti-inflammatory painkiller. You can take paracetamol and codeine together, but studies suggest the resulting pain relief is not much better than taking one or other alone.
Always follow the dose instructions on the pack and do not take more than the dose advised on the pack.
Are there any side-effects of the painkillers?
Paracetamol is not likely to cause side-effects. Codeine and dihydrocodeine may cause drowsiness or constipation.
For constipation, standard laxatives (bought over the counter) can be used such as:
Senna tablets.

Lactulose.

Diet and lifestyle changes, alongside any medication, can help. These include:

Increasing the amount of exercise - even just walking.
It is important to treat constipation promptly because straining worsens rib pain. Codeine can be continued, together with enough laxative to relieve the constipation. Codeine can cause drowsiness in some people - driving should be avoided if affected and the dose reduced.
Anti-inflammatory painkillers (such as naproxen or ibuprofen) can cause stomach ulcers or stomach inflammation (gastritis). Many people can take them without problems, but some people need to be very careful about taking anti-inflammatory painkillers.
DO NOT take anti-inflammatory painkillers if also taking anti-clotting medicines such as warfarin, heparin or similar medication.

You are taking these painkillers for long periods - say, for over two weeks continuously.
A different painkiller may be suggested or a medicine to protect the stomach (for example, omeprazole). Stomach inflammation or ulcers can cause pain in the upper part of the tummy (abdomen). If this occurs then anti-inflammatory tablets should be stopped and medical advice sought.
Black tarry stools, blood in vomit or vomit that looks like coffee grounds could be signs of bleeding from an ulcer. Anyone with these symptoms should attend the Emergency Department at their nearest hospital.
Are there any other treatments?
For severe pain, another option is a nerve block with local anaesthetic near to the injury. This is rarely necessary and is not usually available.
Surgery may be offered if there are multiple rib fractures following major trauma. This may be required if the damage to the chest wall is so severe that the muscles are unable to support the movements of the lungs. It is not usually offered in other circumstances and current evidence suggests that it does not help speed the healing process.
Note:
It is important NOT to wrap a bandage tightly round the chest to support it. Although this may help the pain, it stops the lungs from expanding fully and can lead to pneumonia. It is important that the ribs and muscles are allowed to move normally which is why pain relief is necessary.
What are the complications of broken or bruised ribs?
Most rib injuries heal well with no ongoing problems. Complications can occur if internal organs are damaged by the sharp end of a broken rib.
Pneumothorax
Pneumothorax occurs if the membrane around the lung is damaged. Air enters and forms a pocket of trapped air around the lung, which squashes the lung. The word pneumothorax means air in the thorax. Symptoms include shortness of breath or pain on breathing - sometimes pain near the shoulder. A pneumothorax can be suspected from listening to the chest with a stethoscope and can show on a chest X-ray. It may need treatment under local anaesthetic to remove the trapped air.
A pneumothorax is usually noticed soon after the injury. However, it can occasionally occur later, even several days afterwards. It is important to be alert for symptoms such as shortness of breath, increasing chest pain, or pain that is not near the break (fracture) and urgent medical advice should be sought for these symptoms.
Rarely, a dangerous pneumothorax can occur where air is trapped under pressure. It compresses the lungs and causes increasing difficulty breathing. This is called a tension pneumothorax and is a medical emergency.
Note: anyone who has chest pain associated with difficulty breathing or who feels more breathless than usual needs immediate medical help - call for an emergency ambulance immediately- 999 in the UK - or attend the local Emergency Department.
Surgical emphysema
A sharp fractured rib can let air from the lung get in underneath the skin. This causes a swollen or bubbly area which may crackle when pressed. It is called surgical emphysema. It will clear up gradually. Surgical emphysema can sometimes be linked to a pneumothorax (see above) and the pneumothorax may need treatment.
Haemothorax
This is similar to a pneumothorax except that there is blood, not air, trapped around the lung. The blood collects at the base of the lung, so may cause shortness of breath or pain in the lower part of the chest. It is treated by draining off the trapped blood.
Tummy (abdominal) injuries
The lower part of the rib cage is near the liver, spleen and kidneys. Rib fractures can cause internal damage to these organs. Symptoms are tummy or back pain (rarely, pain may travel to the shoulder). If there is internal bleeding, this can cause faintness or a feeling of being very unwell. Urgent surgery may be needed.
Chest infections
Rib fractures or bruising often make it difficult to breathe deeply or cough properly due to pain. This can make it difficult to clear mucus in the chest, leading to chest infections. Good pain relief helps to prevent chest infections. (See 'How to treat a rib injury', above.)
Even with good painkillers, some people may develop a chest infection. Medical advice should be sought for symptoms such as cough, high temperature (fever), chest pain, shortness of breath or increasing phlegm (sputum) following a rib injury.
Complications are more likely if the injury involved a large force and if the injured person is frail or has other medical problems. If a complication is suspected, medical advice should be sought.
Frequently asked questions
There are some common questions about broken and bruised ribs people may ask from a GP or search online.
How long should I be off work with a broken rib?
Most people will not need any significant amount of time off work following a simple rib injury. Depending on the nature of the work, some people may need some time off, particularly if the work involves lifting or moving around a lot. If there are multiple rib fractures from a severe injury such as a car accident or fall from a height, then this may require a significant amount of time off work.
Why does the pain from a broken rib get worse after the first week?
Sometimes it can feel that pain gets worse before it gets better. The initial pain is often due to the injury itself whereas, as the injured area starts to heal, it becomes inflamed as part of the healing process. This can feel more painful than the injury itself did.
Pain can also feel worse because people are trying to get back to normal activities too soon or because they have reduced their painkillers too soon and need to restart them.
Can you break a rib from coughing?
Rib injuries can occasionally be caused by coughing or straining. This is more likely if there is weakness of the ribs such as occurs with 'thinning of the bones' (osteoporosis) or other disease in the bone.

Summary
What are the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes?
The Ehlers Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of conditions which are usually (although not always) inherited from parents. EDS affects connective tissue - people with EDS have a problem with the formation and structure of connective tissue in the body. Connective tissue is a particularly important component of skin, muscles and ligaments, blood vessels and heart valves.
Whilst the symptoms of EDS may be mild and undiagnosed, for some people with EDS the symptoms can be severe, life-changing and even life-threatening.
There are 13 types of EDS. Most forms of EDS affect:
The skin (which can be unusually stretchy and sometimes fragile).

The type of EDS inherited from parents is always the same type - for example, a parent with vascular EDS cannot pass on hypermobile EDS to their child. These can be inherited via autosomal dominant inheritance (for hypermobile, classical and venous EDS) which means one in two children will be affected on average, or autosomal recessive inheritance (for kyphoscoliotic EDS) which means one in four children will be affected on average. Occasionally EDS is not inherited from a parent but has been caused by a random gene mutation.
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or syndromes?
Until fairly recently, the name 'Ehlers-Danlos syndrome' was used to describe all forms of the condition. However, there are many different types of EDS and EDS is now therefore called 'the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes'.
How common are the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes?
It is estimated that EDS can occur in between 1 in 5,000 and 1 in 250,000 births.
The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes symptoms
Symptoms range from mild to very severe, and vary with type of EDS.
Milder forms of EDS are often not diagnosed until early adulthood, as it can take some time before the symptoms and signs become noticeable.
The more severe types, however, are diagnosed mainly in childhood. Some types are so rare that it is hard to generalise about normal symptoms. Below are the main symptoms seen in EDS.
Hypermobility syndrome is a condition where there are hypermobile joints but none of the other EDS symptoms. They are often treated in the same way.
Joint changes
Joints are loose and 'double-jointed' (hypermobile), so that they have a greater than normal range and degree of movement. This occurs in all types of EDS.

Dislocations of joints may easily occur, and people with EDS can often put their own joints back into place because the tissues are so stretchy. Joint pains are also common.
Skin changes
In all types of EDS except the vascular type, the skin feels soft and is unusually stretchy.

The picture shows how easy it is to pull the skin downwards and away from the body. When let go, the skin immediately returns to its normal position.
Many affected people find that their skin splits and bruises easily and that skin injuries heal slowly. People with some types of EDS have scars that tend to become wide and thin. Blood vessels near to the skin surface can be very delicate and can be damaged easily.
Mobile lumps can develop under the skin of people with EDS, particularly around the elbows and knees, and tiny hard lumps may also form around the heel.
In the vascular type of EDS, the skin is not stretchy but it may look slightly transparent, so that blood vessels can be seen underneath the skin.
Muscles and skeleton
The muscles of people with many forms of EDS tend to be floppier and less strong than those of people without EDS. In severe cases, found in childhood, this may be noticed because of difficulty with walking, such as falling over frequently, or because of problems with balance. In more severe cases, people find it helpful to use a stick or a wheelchair to help them get about.
Poor grip and difficulty writing are sometimes a problem. Special aids may be needed at school, in the kitchen and in other places where grip is important. Sometimes the voice tires easily when shouting, singing or talking loudly. Easy tiring of the muscles is common.
People with EDS are more prone to hernias in the groin and in surgical scars. In some types of EDS, curvature of the spine (scoliosis) can develop.
Tiredness and sleep disturbance
Tiredness, getting tired easily after physical activity (fatiguability) and dizziness are very common in EDS of many types. Sleep disorders are also common. The milder types of EDS can seem similar to, and is often mistaken for, chronic fatigue syndrome and/or fibromyalgia.
Pain
Widespread pain or pain in the limbs is a common feature of most types of EDS. Exercise is important but should be chosen to minimise the risks of injuries - swimming, walking, tai chi or using a stationary bike are all good options.
Mood
Difficulties with mood, particularly anxiety, panic disorder and depression, are common conditions in the general population but they are more commonly experienced by people with EDS. This is thought mainly to be due to the constant high risks of joint dislocation (with the associated pain and disability) with little or no warning.
Heart
An uncomfortable feeling of thudding of the heart (palpitations) and a faster heart rate are seen in hypermobile EDS. It is also more common to experience dizziness and a faster pulse rate on standing in hypermobile EDS.
Some people with EDS have problems with their heart valves due to connective tissue changes, particularly as they get older, and they may develop a murmur.
In the rare vascular type of EDS, serious complications involving blood vessels can develop, including aneurysms and blood vessel rupture. This risk can be lowered by medication.
Lungs
Asthma-like symptoms can occur in some forms of EDS The exact mechanism for this is unclear.
Digestive system
Constipation and diverticulosis (in which there are bulges in the wall of the large intestine) are more common in people with EDS.

Eyes, ears and teeth
Tinnitus is common in several types of EDS. Many people also have dizziness (vertigo).
Some very rare types of EDS affect the eyes. The areas around the pupils (sclera) may be blue rather than white and the eyeballs themselves may be very fragile. One rare subtype also affects the gums and teeth.
Children's health
Children with EDS often show delay in crawling, walking and standing. They tend to be more floppy than usual. Some rare types of EDS can affect growth and cause early joint dislocations.
Women's health
Prolapse of the womb (uterus) is more common in EDS. Prolapse is a common condition in women who have children; however, it is seen in EDS in women who have not had children more commonly than you would otherwise expect.
Causes of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes
The syndromes are genetic conditions. The genes which cause most types of EDS have been clearly identified and can be tested for. However, the most common form of EDS, hypermobility EDS (hEDS), is an exception to this, as the gene which causes it has not yet been identified.
In some cases, the faulty gene is inherited from an affected parent. However, a person may also be affected if there is a new mutation in the gene, in which case EDS may occur in people with no medical history of the disorder in their family.
The more common types of EDS show autosomal dominant inheritance, meaning having one faulty gene, from one parent, will cause the condition (and the parent will also have the condition). Rarer types of EDS show autosomal recessive inheritance.

How are the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes diagnosed?
EDS is usually suspected because of the typical symptoms of one of the types. The doctor may ask about close family members and any problems they may have had with their skin or joints. Once the condition is suspected, specialist testing, including genetic counselling and testing, may be offered to determine the type of EDS.
The exception to this is double-jointed (hypermobility) EDS (hEDS), the most common type, for which there is so far no genetic test. The diagnosis of hEDS is made from discovering a very specific set of symptoms. This is described under the description of hEDS below.
Treatment for the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes
There is no cure for EDS. Treatment is aimed at trying to protect the skin and the joints from further damage and at managing other symptoms which arise. For most people with EDS, generally speaking:
Physiotherapy can be very helpful to build strength and help balance, as well as to provide support for joints by strengthening muscles.

What is the outlook for the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes?
The outlook (prognosis) is variable and depends on the type of EDS. Most forms of EDS do not affect a person's lifespan and people with milder symptoms are able to live their lives without any restrictions. The need to protect the skin and joints in those with more marked symptoms can limit a person's chosen activities - particularly having to reduce activities with a risk of physical injury, such as rugby - and can cause significant disability.
Many people with EDS have more severe symptoms and may have significant disabilities and therefore a severe restriction of their lives.
If someone has the rare type of EDS that affects the blood vessels (the vascular type) then there is a risk of bursting (rupture) of large blood vessels or internal organs, and therefore premature death.
Types of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes
The classification of EDS into different types has changed several times over the years. In 2017 there was a major change to the current classification. This divides EDS into 13 types.
These are:
Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

They are classified by what they are like to experience and to examine (their presentation) and also by the gene changes that cause them.
Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
HEDS is the most common form of EDS. It is inherited but so far no gene has been identified as the cause. It can be mild and is probably often undiagnosed. However many people with hEDS can have significant pain and disability.
The main symptoms of hEDS are stretchy skin (which is not fragile but which may heal slowly) and unusually flexible joints.
Many people with hEDS have tiredness, pain and mood changes. The symptoms may include

How is hEDS diagnosed?
hEDS can be quite difficult to diagnose, as there is no specific test for it. As a result it often goes undiagnosed.
When symptoms are relatively mild, hEDS may be similar to benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS). Some doctors think that the two conditions may be different degrees of the same thing.
Criterion 1: generalised joint hypermobility (GJH)
This is detected by doctors using a series of stretching and joint-bending tests which lead to the 'Beighton score'. GJH is diagnosed with a score or five or more (if aged under 50 years) and four or more (if aged over 50 years). Some doctors also use the 'five-point questionnaire' which asks :
Can you, or could you ever, put your hands flat on the floor without bending your knees?

Unusually soft or velvety skin.
Mild skin hyperextensibility.
Unexplained stretchmarks.
Piezogenic papules (little hard lumps under the skin) of the heel.

Some of the common symptoms of hEDS, such as tiredness and tummy pain, are not included in the list of symptoms needed for diagnosis. This is because they are commonly found in many other conditions too, including other sorts of EDS, so they don't help identify hEDS specifically.
How is hEDS managed?
Regular gentle exercise and keeping your weight within the recommended range for your height will help fitness and stabilisation of joints with good, working muscles. Pilates can be beneficial in helping maintain core stability and maintaining good posture.

Some activities are better avoided, in order to protect the skin and joints from injury. Contact team sports, such as rugby and football, increase the risk of injury to joints, and it is better to choose less high-risk activities such as tennis or swimming.

Is hEDS the same as joint hypermobility syndrome?
Some doctors believe that hEDS is a more severe form of hypermobility syndrome and there is certainly an overlap in symptoms. However, hypermobility syndrome mainly affects joints. EDS is more likely to be the diagnosis where there are associated, more serious conditions, such as heart valve problems, prolapse or repeated dislocations.
Classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
Classical EDS (cEDS) affects 1 in 20,000-50,000 people. It is autosomal dominant genetic condition, which means that inheriting one affected gene (one from either parent) causes the condition.
cEDS is similar to hEDS but in addition patients have very fragile skin, which is prone to splitting, particularly over the forehead, elbows, knees and chin. Those affected also have a tendency to form particularly thin scars. People also get rolled-up skin around joints which can be easily injured, little mobile nodules under the skin and easy bruising. Floppy muscles can be a feature, and children with cEDS may be slow to stand and walk.
cEDS is suspected if there is skin hyperextensibility and thin scars PLUS joint hypermobility. The other possible effects of cEDS include tiredness, poor sleep, tummy pains and prolapse. Sometimes there are problems with the heart valves, which can become floppy, causing a heart murmur.
Management of cEDS
The main way in which management of cEDS differs from hEDS is in the need to protect the fragile skin. The important things are:
Protecting the skin to minimise injuries with appropriate clothing and, when needed, protective pads and helmets.

Any injury that needs stitching should be done by a plastic surgeon. Stitches need to be left in place for longer than usual and wounds need extra support, with Steri-strips® or bandaging.

Children with cEDS need to find a balance between restrictions and risks. Contact sports such as rugby, ice hockey, boxing and martial arts, and high-impact activities like trampolining, are high-risk for injury and may need to be avoided. Lower-impact physical activities such as badminton, table tennis, bowling and swimming are better alternatives.

Classical-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
This is also called tenascin-X deficient Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (clEDS).
This very rare condition is similar to cEDS, except that affected people do not make wide scars. It is autosomal recessive, which means that inheritance requires one faulty gene from EACH parent. If a parent has only one faulty gene each, they will generally NOT have the condition.
The other features of clEDS which are less common in other types of EDS are:
Long thin fingers.

clEDS is managed like cEDS, above. It is specifically recommended to avoid smoking.
Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
Vascular EDS (vEDS) is the most serious form of EDS. It affects about one in 50,000-200,000 people.
vEDS has autosomal dominant inheritance so just one copy of the defective gene from either parent will cause the condition. A person may also be affected if there is a new mutation in the gene, and so vEDS may occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.
The main risk that people with vEDS face is leaking or bursting (rupture) of medium/large arteries. There is also a small risk of rupture of the large bowel (colon), and of the womb (uterus) during labour, and of spontaneous pneumothorax (caused by popping of an air space in the lungs). These are life-threatening effects, which usually occur in young adulthood, making this an extremely difficult diagnosis to be given.
Other features of vEDS include:
Early varicose veins.

Management of vEDS
Treatment with a medicine called celiprolol greatly reduces the risk of arterial rupture. It may also be possible to repair blood vessels at risk of rupture before they do. This is a very specialised area.
vEDS patients should wear a medical alert bracelet, necklace or similar. The EDS National Diagnostic Service has produced a medic alert sheet with the information that may be needed in case of an emergency. It is best to avoid invasive tests or invasive treatments unless strictly necessary, because of the risk of damage to skin and blood vessels.
Cardiac-valvular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
Cardiac-valvular EDS (cvEDS) causes problems with the heart valves, in addition to other, clEDS-like symptoms. It is a rare condition and inheritance requires one faulty gene from EACH parent. (If they only have one faulty gene each then they will generally NOT have cvEDS.)
Management is as for cEDS but with regular heart scans and monitoring, as the heart valves may need repair or replacement.
Arthrochalasia Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
Arthrochalasia EDS (aEDS) is a very rare, severe type of EDS in which the joints are very, very much looser than they should be. It has autosomal dominant inheritance so just one copy of the defective gene from either parent will cause the condition. It is usually diagnosed soon after birth, as babies are born with two dislocated hips. They also tend to have rather weak, floppy muscles, and particularly stretchy loose skin. Only around 30 cases have ever been described.
In addition to the severe joint problems, affected people also have fragile skin and, sometimes, a tendency to curvature of the spine.
Management of aEDS
The most important problem for children with aEDS is the early hip dislocation, since this severely affects mobility. Most of the usual surgical treatments for this condition do not work, so it is helpful if the diagnosis of aEDs is made before the hips are treated in order that a method that will succeed is chosen first.
Repeated dislocation of other joints can slow children from progress in standing and walking. The symptoms are worst in infancy and tend to improve with age so that some children manage to use orthoses (such as braces and callipers) to assist in walking later on.
Dermatosparaxis Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
Dermatosparaxis EDS (dEDS) is an extremely rare type of EDS which has been described only around ten times. Affected people have extremely fragile, sagging skin. It is usually diagnosed before the age of 2 years. Fragility, bruising and sagging of the skin are severe but, surprisingly, the skin heals well. Like the other rare types, inheritance requires one faulty gene from EACH parent. If a parent has only one faulty gene, they will generally NOT have the condition.
Affected children tend to have characteristic facial features, such as prominent eyes with blue or grey sclerae (the whites of the eyes) and a small chin. They often have other features seen in classical EDS, such as:
Hypermobile joints.

Hernias.

Tiredness.

They can also experience abnormalities of the teeth, gums and vision, requiring spectacles.
Management of dEDS
Management is as for cEDS. A specialist dentist will need to be involved if there are tooth and gum problems, and an ophthalmologist if there are eye problems.
Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
This is a rare type of EDS which has been described only around 60 times. Like the other rare types, in order to inherit kyphoscoliotic EDS (kEDS), inheritance requires one faulty gene from each parent. If a parent has only one faulty gene each, they will generally NOT have the condition. It causes worsening (progressive) curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis).
Babies with kEDS are very floppy and they stand and walk late. Eyes are also affected and may have a thin surface (sclera) which appears slightly blue and which can (rarely) rupture. Some affected children have hearing problems. Other signs of this type of EDS include thin bones and long thin fingers
Joints are very hypermobile and there may be frequent dislocations. Skin may be stretchy, soft and fragile, bruise easily and form widened, atrophic scars.
Management of kEDS
This is as for classical EDS but with particular focus on trying to keep the back growing straight and involving a specialist optician to look after the eyes.
Brittle cornea syndrome
In this rare type of EDS the front coverings of the eye are thinner and less strong than usual and the white of the eye (sclera) may appear blue. Like the other rare types, inheritance requires one faulty gene from each parent. If a parent has only one faulty gene, they will generally NOT have the condition.
People with brittle cornea syndrome are generally very short-sighted and the eye itself is at risk of rupturing. They also have the typical skin and joint features of classical and hypermobility types of EDS.
Management of brittle cornea syndrome
This is as for cEDS, with additional care needed for the eyes.
Spondylodysplastic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
Spondylodysplastic EDS (spEDS) is a severe EDS. Like the other rare types, inheritance requires one faulty gene from each parent. If a parent has only one faulty gene each, they will generally NOT have the condition. It causes short stature and weak floppy muscles. Bowing of limbs is common.
Unlike other types, there may be learning difficulties in children. Some of the features of EDS affecting eyes, bones, joints, blood vessels or the lungs may be present and there is a characteristic facial appearance.
Management of spEDS
Management involves the approaches used in cEDS towards skin and joints, together with specialist physiotherapy as the child grows up - to help maximise their bone growth and strength. It is not possible to generalise about the degree of learning difficulty that children experience as the condition is so rare.
Musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
Musculocontractural EDS (mcEDS) is a rare type of EDS in which muscles in the legs and arms are severely tightened and shortened - these are called muscle contractures. The skin is severely affected too, being very stretchy, fragile and easily bruised, with the atrophic scars seen in clEDS. It can also affect bones, eyes, the digestive system and the kidneys. Like the other rare types, inheritance requires one faulty gene from each parent. If a parent has only one faulty gene, they will generally NOT have the condition.
Management of mcEDS
Management of this condition follows the patterns detailed above for cEDS, with special attention to any of the eye, bone, kidney or digestive symptoms.
Myopathic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
Myopathic EDS (mEDS) is a milder subtype of EDS which causes very floppy muscles which may seem very poorly developed at birth but which improve with age. It is possible to inherit mEDS if just one parent is affected although some 'versions' of mEDS seem to require inheritance of a faulty gene from both parents.
Management of mEDS
Management is as for the other types, with a focus on physiotherapy and muscle strengthening.
Periodontal Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
Periodontal EDS (pEDS) causes dental problems, particularly inflamed or absent gums and poor tooth development, on top of typical features of cEDS. It is rare but only one faulty gene (from either parent) is needed to develop the condition.
Management of pEDS
Management of pEDS is as for management of hEDS and cEDS but with additional, specialist dental care.
Summary
EDS is a very varied condition, which primarily affects skin and joints but which can also affect many other organs. Thirteen subtypes have now been classified.
There is no specific cure for hEDS but if symptoms are interfering with life, then physiotherapy, gentle exercise, talking therapies and, sometimes, pain relief are the mainstays of treatment. With the other types of EDS, specialist teams should be involved in the care, depending on which organs are affected.
