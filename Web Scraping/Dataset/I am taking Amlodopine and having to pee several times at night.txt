Hi - I am taking Amlopdipine 10mg - upped from 5mg - and am having to get up in the night to pee every hour and during the hour for the first couple of hours - the whole night. I get about 2 -3 hours sleep if I’m lucky. GP had told me to discontinue the meds for 7 days to see if they are causing the high volume nocturia but I’m worried that my BP will soar. I was treated for a UTI which has cleared but that needed a few doses.
Does anyone else have this problem and how was it treated?
