Epilepsy and planning pregnancy
This leaflet offers advice for women who are planning to become pregnant. The aim is to plan ahead to reduce the risk of any harm to the baby and to reduce the risk of pregnancy complications. Women on regular medication, or who have a long-term medical condition, may need to seek medical advice to discuss any changes which may need to be made. This is ideally done before pregnancy.
There is a summary checklist at the end of the leaflet.

Summary and checklist
Women who are already pregnant may find Diet and lifestyle during pregnancy more help.
When should I have my next baby?
Studies have shown that having very long or very short gaps between pregnancies can result in problems during pregnancy. The general advice is that waiting between 18 and 23 months before becoming pregnancy again results in the best outcomes. However women who have had a previous pre-term birth or a previous pregnancy loss tend to have better outcomes if they become pregnant again with a shorter time frame - 9 months between pregnancies appears to be the best length of time for these women.
Significantly longer or shorter gaps between pregnancies raise the risk of premature birth and smaller babies.
For women over the age of 35, becoming pregnant less than 12 months after giving birth also increases the chance of serious complications for the mother. For women under 35, having babies close together does not increase the risks to the mother's health.
Folic acid supplements
Folic acid tablets (supplements) should be started as soon as contraception is stopped when planning a pregnancy. It should ideally be continued from at least one month before becoming pregnant until at least the end of the 12th week of pregnancy. This is important for all women, even those who are healthy and have a good diet.
It is important to note that, even though folic acid is best started before you fall pregnant, there are still benefits of starting it in pregnancy. If you are unexpectedly pregnant and had not been taking folic acid, start taking it as soon as you find out and continue till the end of the 12th week of pregnancy.
Pregnancy
Acupuncture has been a mainstay of ancient Chinese medicine for centuries, and in the last few decades it has been used increasingly commonly alongside fertility treatment, like IVF, with the aim of boosting the chances of a successful outcome. Plenty of women have had acupuncture during a round of fertility treatment and fallen pregnant. But can this sometimes costly practice, dismissed by many in western medicine as quackery, really have any impact on a woman's chances of having a baby?

Folic acid is a vitamin which occurs naturally in certain foods such as spinach, sprouts, broccoli, green beans and potatoes. Some bread and breakfast cereals are fortified with folic acid. However, the intake for each individual can vary.
Pregnant women need a good supply of folic acid to help with the development of the baby. Folic acid tablets in early pregnancy reduce the risk of having a baby born with a spinal cord problem such as spina bifida.
Folic acid tablets can be bought from supermarkets or pharmacies. Also, in the UK, the NHS Healthy Start scheme provides vitamin supplements that contain folic acid. These are free to many women who are on certain state benefits.
For most women, the dose is 400 micrograms (0.4 mg) a day. Women with a higher risk of having a child with a spinal cord problem need to take 5 mg a day - this is only available on prescription. Women needing 5mg a day include those who:
Have had a previously affected pregnancy.
Have had a previously affected pregnancy.
Have (or have a partner with or a family member with) a spinal cord defect.

Because of the substantial benefits of folic acid, some countries routinely fortify staple foods - such as wheat, cornflour or rice - with folic acid. Currently there is debate as to whether the UK should follow suit and fortify certain common foods with folic acid.
Vitamin D supplements
Vitamin D is needed for growth. Vitamin D supplements are recommended for all pregnant women, breastfeeding women and breastfed babies. Women at risk of having a low vitamin D level may be advised to start building up their levels of vitamin D before becoming pregnant. The following groups of people are at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency:
People who do not have much exposure to sunlight (much of our vitamin D is obtained from sunlight) - for example people who go out covered up or who are housebound.
People who do not have much exposure to sunlight (much of our vitamin D is obtained from sunlight) - for example people who go out covered up or who are housebound.
People of South Asian, African, Caribbean, or Middle Eastern family origin (darker skins absorb less vitamin D from sunlight).

Supplements can be bought from a supermarket or pharmacy. See also the separate leaflet called Vitamin D deficiency for more information.
Alcohol
Once pregnant, the advice is to avoid all alcohol, at least for the first three months, and ideally throughout your pregnancy. It is sensible for women who are planning a pregnancy to cut down their alcohol intake and ideally to stop altogether.
See the separate leaflet called Diet and lifestyle during pregnancy for more information about the possible damage alcohol can cause a developing baby.
Women who are dependent on alcohol and may not be able to stop drinking without help should seek medical advice. See also the separate leaflet called Alcohol and sensible drinking for more details.
Smoking
Smoking causes harm to the developing baby and also to children in the home, as well as to the smoker themselves. Pregnant women are strongly advised not to smoke. See the separate leaflet called How to quit smoking for more information about the harm smoking can cause.
Because it can be hard to stop smoking, it is best to try to stop before becoming pregnant. There are more medical or other options available to help non-pregnant people stop smoking - some of these methods are not safe in pregnancy. See the separate leaflet called How to quit smoking for more information.
Recreational drugs
It is very strongly recommended not to use any recreational (illicit) drugs during pregnancy. It is best to postpone the pregnancy until no longer taking any drugs. Women with an unplanned pregnancy should aim to stop the drugs as soon as possible.
Women who are unable to stop their drug use should receive a referral to a community drug team by their obstetrician or midwife. See the separate leaflet called Diet and lifestyle during pregnancy to read more about the effects recreational drugs can have in pregnancy, and how the community drug teams can help.
Overweight and obesity
Women who are overweight or obese have more difficulty conceiving. There are also more likely to be complications in pregnancy if you are overweight, such as:
Diabetes in pregnancy.

High blood pressure in pregnancy.

The risks increase as BMI increases.
Being underweight is also associated with problems in becoming pregnant and complications in pregnancy. Women with a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 have the ideal body weight for a healthy pregnancy.
Food and diet
Generally speaking, women who are planning to become pregnant should eat a normal healthy balanced diet. There is particular advice for pregnant women about foods and drinks to avoid. See the separate leaflet called Diet and lifestyle during pregnancy.
Medication
It is known that certain medicines are safe in pregnancy. For example, paracetamol at normal dose is safe and useful for headaches, backache and other aches and pains that may occur during pregnancy.
However, some medicines are not safe and may be harmful to a developing baby, particularly in the first few weeks of pregnancy. Therefore, it is sensible to tell a doctor or dentist who is prescribing medication that a pregnancy is being planned. The advice may be to take the medication, to stop it once a positive pregnancy test has been achieved or to change the medication.
It is advised not to take medicines that can be bought over the counter (including herbal remedies) unless they are known to be safe in pregnancy. The pharmacist will be able to advise about this.
Women who are already on regular medication should seek medical advice before becoming pregnant. It may be that this medication is not safe for use in pregnancy and a safer alternative may be advised. In some cases, a specialist referral may be needed to discuss this. Medication which may need to be changed includes:
Medication for epilepsy.
Medication for epilepsy.
Medication for diabetes type 1 or type 2.
Medication for diabetes type 1 or type 2.
Medication for mental health conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.
Medication for mental health conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.
Medication for high blood pressure, particularly pills which are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers such as losartan or candesartan.

Medication for high cholesterol, such as statins.
Medication for high cholesterol, such as statins.
If you have an unplanned pregnancy, discuss with your doctor as early as possible any medication that you take. In some cases, the risk of taking the medicine has to be balanced against the risk of not taking the medicine and your condition not being treated.
Infections
Rubella (German measles)
Women planning to become pregnant for the first time should check that they are immune to rubella before becoming pregnant. A pre-pregnancy blood test can be requested from most surgeries without the need for an appointment. Most women are immune to rubella, as they have been immunised as a child. However, childhood immunisation against rubella is not 100% effective and therefore should be checked. If you are not immune, you can be immunised.
Note: you should not become pregnant for one month after the injection and ideally until your immunity has been confirmed by a further blood test.
The rubella virus causes a mild illness in adults but can seriously damage an unborn baby, especially in the early stages of growth.
Chickenpox
Having chickenpox when pregnant can cause a severe illness and there is some risk to the developing baby. A vaccine is offered to healthcare workers (doctors, nurses, etc) who have not previously had chickenpox and so are not immune and may catch chickenpox. (About 1 adult in 10 has not had chickenpox as a child.) Non-immune healthcare workers should consider having this vaccination before becoming pregnant.
Hepatitis B
A mother who is infected with hepatitis B has a high risk of passing it on to her newborn baby. Women at high risk of catching hepatitis B, you should be immunised against this virus before becoming pregnant. People at increased risk and who should be immunised include:
Those whose job puts them at risk of contracting hepatitis B - for example, healthcare personnel and staff at daycare or residential centres.

Consider your working environment
Certain jobs and workplaces may pose a risk to a pregnancy, in particular to the early stages of pregnancy. This includes women who:
Work with raw meat. Raw meat is sometimes contaminated with bacteria such as listeria and toxoplasma. If these bacteria infect adults, they may cause listeriosis or toxoplasmosis but usually cause little harm. However, these germs can cause serious problems to an unborn child if their mother becomes infected during pregnancy.

However, these germs can cause serious problems to an unborn child if their mother becomes infected during pregnancy.
Work with certain animals. For example:
It is important to avoid contact with sheep and lambs at lambing time. This is because some lambs are born contaminated with germs such as listeria, toxoplasma and chlamydia, which may affect an unborn baby.
Cats and kittens often carry toxoplasma germs - especially in cat poo (faeces). So, cleaning out cat litter trays and handling cats and kittens can be a risk.

Women who think that their occupation may pose a risk to a pregnancy should discuss this with their employer before becoming pregnant. A change in job, or in working practice, may be necessary. This may need to be discussed with an occupational health doctor.

There are information guides from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) website. They also have an information line for women with a health and safety concern at work but who do not wish to discuss their intention to become pregnant with their employer.
Medical conditions
Women with certain medical conditions may benefit from advice before becoming pregnant. Women with any of the conditions listed below would be advised to continue using contraception until having had a discussion with a GP. Women with an unplanned pregnancy and any of these conditions, should seek medical advice as soon as possible. Do not stop any medication without advice from a doctor.
Diabetes
It is extremely important that diabetic women seek medical advice BEFORE becoming pregnant. This is because good control of blood sugar levels, both before pregnancy and in early pregnancy, can reduce various risks.
Diabetes increases the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. It also increases the risk of the baby being born with abnormalities, or becoming seriously ill after birth.
However, good control of sugar levels starting before pregnancy can reduce these risks. You should be referred to a specialist in diabetes, and your medication (and/or insulin) may be changed.
You will have checks on your eyes and your kidneys. You will work with your specialist together to get your blood glucose levels within a very tight range. The better the control before pregnancy and during early pregnancy, the better the outcome. See the separate leaflet called Diabetes and pregnancy.
Epilepsy
Many treatments for epilepsy are not safe to take in pregnancy. This should be discussed with an epilepsy specialist BEFORE becoming pregnant. Some women may need to be switched to another medication. However, it is risky to have fits in pregnancy too, so it is important not stop medication suddenly without specialist advice. It is advisable to keep taking contraception until you have had this discussion. See the separate leaflet called Epilepsy and seizures.
High blood pressure
As discussed in the medication section above, there are some blood pressure tablets which should not be taken during pregnancy. Women on medication for high blood pressure (hypertension), should ideally discuss this with a GP before becoming pregnant.
Mental health
Women taking medication for depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, should seek medical advice before becoming pregnant. The risks of taking medication in pregnancy will need to be weighed against the risks of becoming mentally ill if the medications are stopped.
Women with a past history of severe mental health illness should be under the care of a specialist who can monitor you during pregnancy. You should have access to details about who you should contact if you feel you are becoming unwell.
Hereditary conditions
People with a history of a condition that runs in families may wish to have genetic testing before planning a pregnancy. This will help assess the chances of having that condition. Examples of conditions which may run in families include:
Huntington's disease.

Blood conditions such as sickle cell anaemia or thalassaemia.
Screening tests
Pregnant women in England, Scotland and Wales and those at high risk in Northern Ireland are offered a screening test for sickle cell disease and thalassaemia. Some women may wish to have the screening test before becoming pregnant, especially if their family origins make these diseases more likely.
People from families originating from Africa, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, Sardinia, Greece, Turkey or Cyprus are more likely to have one of these conditions or to be a carrier for one.
Genetic testing is a rapidly developing area of medicine. It may be possible that more tests will become available to detect carriers of various diseases. When they become available, these may be tests to consider before becoming pregnant.
Cervical smear
All women from the age of 25 should have a three-yearly cervical smear to check for early pre-cancer changes to the neck of the womb (cervix). (In the UK women are invited every three years between the ages of 25 and 49, and every five years between the ages of 50 and 64.) This cannot be done in pregnancy or for three months after a baby is born.
So, if thinking of becoming pregnant, it is sensible to check whether a smear is due and, if it is due, to have it before becoming pregnant.
Summary and checklist
Most pregnancies go well and without any major problems. But, it is wise to reduce any risks as much as possible. So, below is a reminder of things to consider before becoming pregnant, and as soon as you realise you are pregnant:
Things you should do now
See your doctor to discuss pregnancy if you have any long-standing medical condition or take any regular medication.

Early pregnancy signs and symptoms
Peer reviewed by Dr Krishna Vakharia, MRCGPLast updated by Dr Colin Tidy, MRCGPLast updated 17 May 2023
Meets Patient’s editorial guidelines
Pregnancy tests are very sensitive so it is common to find out that you are pregnant before you develop any signs or symptoms of pregnancy. However, as your pregnancy continues you may experience these early symptoms and signs of pregnancy.
For further advice about having a healthy pregnancy, see also the leaflet Planning to Become Pregnant, which includes information about prenatal vitamin recommendations.
In this article:
What are the early signs of pregnancy?
When can early signs of pregnancy start?
Can you feel pregnant before you miss your period?
Can you experience pregnancy symptoms and not be pregnant?
How do I know I am pregnant?
What should I do when I find out that I am pregnant?
What are the early signs of pregnancy?
The signs of early pregnancy vary tremendously between women. Some women hardly have any symptoms, whereas others have very severe symptoms. It is impossible to predict which women will have more severe symptoms. However, in general, if you are expecting twins or triplets then it is likely that your symptoms will be more severe.
Tiredness
Extreme tiredness is often the most common sign of an early pregnancy. Although it is common to become more tired in the later stages of pregnancy, this extreme tiredness and lack of energy (lethargy) usually last for the first twelve weeks (first trimester). The symptoms usually then improve.
Frequent urination
You may notice that you need to pass urine more frequently than you used to. This is actually due to the effect of the beta-hCG hormone which makes your kidneys work harder to produce more urine. This is different to the reason you will need to pass urine more often in the later stages of pregnancy, which is due to the baby's head pressing on your bladder.
Note: if you experience any burning, stinging or a high temperature (fever) with these urinary symptoms, contact your doctor or midwife. Urine infections are common when you are pregnant. Your doctor or midwife will arrange to test your urine for an infection.
See the separate leaflet called Urine Infection in Pregnancy for more information.
Constipation and bloating
Constipation is more common in the early stages of pregnancy. This is due to the chemical (hormone) progesterone making your bowel more relaxed and sluggish. It is important to have a healthy diet throughout your pregnancy.
If you do become constipated then you should eat more foods with lots of fibre in them, like wholemeal bread, fruit and vegetables. Make sure you are drinking enough fluids, especially water.
Breast tenderness
Another very early sign of pregnancy is breast tenderness. You may find that just the water from your shower on your breasts makes them feel uncomfortable and very tender. You may also find that you wake in the night when you roll on to your front because your breasts are tender.
Your breasts may tingle at times or even have stabbing pains in them. You may also notice that you may have swollen breasts or breasts become bigger over the first few weeks of pregnancy. As your pregnancy develops it is common to notice some veins under the surface of your skin over your breasts. This is entirely normal.
After a few weeks you may notice that the coloured skin around your nipples (the areolae) becomes darker.
Morning sickness and dizziness (nausea)
Although most women think that feeling sick is the first sign of being pregnant, it is more common to develop other symptoms first. Feeling sick usually starts around the sixth week of your pregnancy. It is more common to experience feeling sick only in the mornings. However, you may find that this feeling continues throughout the afternoons and even into the evenings.
This can, however, vary between pregnancies in the same woman as well as between different women. You may find that you are being sick (vomiting) as well as feeling sick. The amount, frequency and time of the day really do vary between women and can also be different (worse or better) in later pregnancies.
This sickness is commonly referred to as morning sickness. It is more common to experience feeling sick only in the mornings. However, you may find that this feeling continues throughout the afternoons and even into the evenings.
See the separate leaflet called Morning Sickness in Pregnancy for more information.
Food cravings and aversions
You may find that you crave certain foods during your pregnancy or even go off some foods (food aversions). Some women experience a metallic taste in their mouth.
Smell sensitivity
You are likely to have a heightened sense of smell during your early pregnancy. This may make any feelings of sickness that you have worse.
Mood swings and irritability
The changes in hormone levels in early pregnancy may make you have more mood swings and feel irritable than usual.
Spotting and missed period
Although this has always been the most obvious sign of pregnancy, many women now find out they are pregnant before they miss their first period.
Many women may have a light period with small amount of bleeding (spotting) at the time of their missed period. This is sometimes called an 'implantation bleed'. It happens when the fertilised egg attaches and fixes itself (implants itself) in the wall of your womb (uterus). It is harmless.
However, if you have any spotting or heavy bleeding when you are pregnant then you should let your doctor or midwife know. In some cases further tests (for example, a scan) are necessary. This is because bleeding can sometimes be a sign of a miscarriage.
See the separate leaflet called Miscarriage and Bleeding in Early Pregnancy for more information.
Less commonly it can be the first symptom of an ectopic pregnancy. 'Ectopic' refers to a pregnancy which occurs outside the womb.
See the separate leaflet called Ectopic Pregnancy for more information.
Heartburn
Indigestion (dyspepsia) is common in pregnancy and is often due to acid reflux from the stomach into the gullet (oesophagus). See also the leaflet called Indigestion and Acid Reflux in Pregnancy.
Cramping
It is common to have cramps that feel lime menstrual cramps.
Cramps in the legs are also common in pregnancy. They occur in late pregnancy and are usually worse at night. Massaging the affected leg and elevation of the foot of the bed may help. Always see a midwife or doctor if you are concerned, particularly as leg pain and swelling may be caused by a deep vein thrombosis.
Raised body temperature
It is normal to have a body temperature that is slightly above your normal body temperature (basal body temperature) when you're pregnant. However an abnormally high or low body temperature could also be a sign of an illness, especially if you feel generally unwell or have any other symptoms. It's also very important to avoid overheating during hot weather or when you exercise.
Weight gain
It is normal to put on 10-16 kg in weight during your pregnancy. The weight gain is mainly due to your baby growing, but your body also stores more fat during pregnancy. Too much or too little weight gain during pregnancy can lead to health problems for you or your unborn baby.
You should see your midwife or doctor if you have any concerns. It is essential that you eat a healthy diet during your pregnancy.
Pregnancy glow or acne (skin changes)
Pregnancy often causes skin changes due to rising hormone levels and increasing blood flow. Pregnancy hormonal changes may promote healthier skin, hair and nails, and pregnancy is often associated with a healthy glow. But pregnancy can also cause skin problems such as acne, unwanted hair growth, hair thinning, skin pigmentation, spider veins and stretch marks.
Congestion
Pregnancy can cause nasal congestion, which is sometimes called pregnancy rhinitis. The lining of your nose may also swell, causing further nasal obstruction.
Increased heart rate
An increased heart rate is common during pregnancy. During the first few months of pregnancy (first trimester), it is normal for your heartbeat to increase by around 15 or 20 beats per minute.
Pregnancy
If you need to have an abortion, you probably have a lot on your plate. Quite aside from the emotions you may be experiencing, there are a number of practical considerations to think about - not least how you go about arranging the procedure or what it is likely to involve.
by Abi Millar
Pregnancy
Cardiotocography is usually called a 'CTG' by doctors and midwives. It can be used to monitor a baby's heart rate and a mother's contractions during labour. Note: the information below is a general guide only. The arrangements, and the way tests are performed, may vary between different hospitals. Always follow the instructions given by your doctor or local hospital.
by Dr Doug McKechnie, MRCGP
When can early signs of pregnancy start?
If you have a regular monthly menstrual cycle, the earliest and most reliable sign of pregnancy is a missed period. The time of your first missed period is usually about 2 weeks after conception, which is when the sperm fertilizes the egg.
Early pregnancy symptoms, such as morning sickness, usually start when you’re about 4-6 weeks pregnant. The number of weeks of your pregnancy is usually taken from the first day of your last menstrual period.
Can you feel pregnant before you miss your period?

Can you experience pregnancy symptoms and not be pregnant?
It's not uncommon to experience pregnancy symptoms without being pregnant. Similar symptoms may occur before a period (premenstrual), at the time of ovulation, or as a side effect of medicines used in fertility treatments.
The symptoms may also occur if you want to be pregnant so badly that you focus on any change so much that you convince yourself you are pregnant, even though you're not.
How do I know I am pregnant?
If you're experiencing early signs of pregnancy then the next thing to do is a home pregnancy test to confirm it. These are are available from chemists and supermarkets and are very sensitive. They test for the presence of a hormone called beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-hCG) in your urine. Beta-hCG is produced by your body when an egg (which has been fertilised by a sperm) attaches and fixes itself (implants itself) into the wall of your womb (uterus).
Different makes of pregnancy tests vary in how sensitive they are. The more sensitive ones can become positive only a few days after conception. However, a negative test does not mean that you are not pregnant; it may just mean that the levels of this hormone are not high enough to be detected by the test.
As pregnancy tests vary in how you use them, it is important to read the instructions carefully before you do the test.
If your first pregnancy test is negative but you think you may be pregnant then you should repeat the pregnancy test one week later. If you have a positive pregnancy test, this does not need to be repeated by a doctor or a midwife.
What should I do when I find out that I am pregnant?
Once your pregnancy has been confirmed by a pregnancy test then you should contact your doctor's surgery. They will arrange for you to see your doctor or midwife. Usually you will be seen by a midwife at around twelve weeks of your pregnancy. They will see you at your surgery, at a children's centre or at home. It is rare nowadays to have to go to a hospital to see a midwife.
How do you tell your boss you're pregnant?
It is important to have a healthy lifestyle during your pregnancy. This includes healthy eating and taking folic acid and vitamin D supplements.
See the separate leaflet called Diet and Lifestyle during Pregnancy for more details.

Chorionic villus sampling
This leaflet discusses the routine pregnancy screening tests (antenatal checks) that should be offered to all pregnant women in the UK. These are screening and diagnostic checks that are done to find out if your baby has a health problem before they are born. Separate newborn screening tests are offered after your baby is born.
In this article:

Pregnancy screening test results
A final point
What are pregnancy screening tests?
A pregnancy screening test (also known as an antenatal check), aims to detect a disease or condition in the early stages before it causes significant problems, and where treatment can be offered. The potential benefits of any screening tests offered should outweigh any possible risks from the test.
Most pregnant women have normal test results. A small number of tests are abnormal. In these cases further assessment and/or treatment can be offered which may prevent serious problems. A midwife or doctor should discuss each test with you before it is done.
Are pregnancy screening tests compulsory?
No. You need to agree for the tests to be done. You can refuse to have a test if you do not want it.
What happens during a pregnancy screening test?
General history (talking to your doctor or midwife)
Early on in your pregnancy your doctor or midwife will ask various questions about your general health, family history and social history, and will ask about any previous pregnancies which you have had. Strictly speaking, this is not a test. However, it can raise issues which may need special attention during the pregnancy, which may prevent problems later in the pregnancy.
For example, if you have diabetes, or if you had pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy, you will need closer monitoring than usual during the pregnancy. If you have social or family problems such as domestic violence then you may need special help.
Physical examinations
Weight and height. Early on in the pregnancy your doctor or midwife will check your weight and height. This is to see if you are significantly underweight or overweight which may increase the risk of developing problems during pregnancy.

Assessing the growth of the baby. This is done by a midwife or doctor during routine antenatal checks. They use a tape to measure from the top of the growing womb (uterus) to the bone at the bottom of your tummy (pubic bone). If need be, an ultrasound scan can more accurately keep an eye on growth if it does not seem to be progressing normally.

If need be, an ultrasound scan can more accurately keep an eye on growth if it does not seem to be progressing normally.
Blood pressure. This is measured regularly during routine antenatal checks. Together with a urine test to detect protein, this screens for a complication of pregnancy called pre-eclampsia. See the separate leaflet called Pre-eclampsia.

Examination of the baby's position. At about 36 weeks of pregnancy a doctor or midwife will examine your tummy (abdomen) to feel the baby to detect if the baby is lying bottom-down (breech). If so, treatment to turn the baby to a head-down position may be considered.

If you are otherwise healthy, other physical examinations are not routinely done. For example, routine vaginal or breast examinations used to be done in the past, but are not necessary. (They may be done if you have symptoms which warrant examination.)
Urine tests
Urine is checked at antenatal checks using a simple dipstick test to detect:
Protein. Protein in the urine may indicate early pre-eclampsia.

Blood tests
A sample of blood is taken early on in pregnancy and put into several tubes. These are sent to the laboratory to check for:
Anaemia. The common reason for anaemia is lack of iron, which can usually be treated easily with iron tablets.

Blood group including rhesus D status and red cell antibodies. If you are rhesus D negative and your baby is rhesus positive then you may form anti-D antibodies in your bloodstream. These are not dangerous in the first pregnancy but can attack the blood cells of a baby who is rhesus D positive in any future pregnancy. To prevent this you will usually be offered anti-D injections later in your pregnancy.

Rubella status. This test checks for antibodies to German measles (the rubella virus). If antibodies are present it means that you are immune to this infection. If you are not immune, when you are pregnant you should keep away from anyone who may have rubella and consider being immunised.

Infections. Some uncommon but serious infections are checked for. These are:
HIV. You can be infected with HIV for years before it causes symptoms. The risk of passing this virus on to your baby can be greatly reduced with treatment during pregnancy, and delivery by caesarean section.
Hepatitis B. Many people are carriers of the hepatitis B virus but have no symptoms. In some cases it can cause serious liver damage. If you have this virus, it may be prevented from affecting your baby if the baby is immunised at birth.
Syphilis. This is an uncommon sexually transmitted infection. Again, you can be infected with this germ (bacterium) without realising and pass it on to your baby. It can develop into a serious illness. It can be treated with antibiotics.

Diabetes. If you have had a history of diabetes in a previous pregnancy (gestational diabetes) then you will be tested for diabetes by a blood test in future pregnancies. In addition, you may be offered a test for diabetes if you have risk factors for diabetes; for example, if you:
Are very overweight.
Have had a heavy baby in the past (≥4.5 kg).
Have a close family relative with diabetes.
Are from certain ethnic groups.

A repeat blood test at about 28 weeks is usually offered to check again for anaemia and red cell antibodies.
Ultrasound scans
An ultrasound scan is a safe and painless test which uses sound waves to create images of structures inside your body, such as an unborn baby. Two scans are normally offered:
An early pregnancy scan works out when your baby is due. The scan is usually done at around 10-13 weeks. This early scan confirms your baby's heart is beating and how many babies are growing inside your womb (uterus).

A fetal anomaly scan is offered later in your pregnancy. The scan is usually done at around 20 weeks. This looks for any developmental problems with your baby. There are variations across the UK as to exactly when and how fetal anomaly scanning is done.

Placenta praevia
Placenta praevia means that the placenta is covering the opening from the womb to the neck of the womb (cervix). This can cause serious problems during childbirth. If an earlier scan using sound waves (an ultrasound scan) indicates that you may have a placenta praevia, a repeat scan at 36 weeks of pregnancy may be advised. This is to clarify the position of your placenta before delivery.
Screening tests for the baby
The programme for checking for abnormalities in your baby differs across the UK. You can choose not to have some of the tests done if you prefer. The scan at around 20 weeks as described above checks for any problems with your baby's heart, kidneys, spine, etc and can check for conditions such as cleft lip/palate.
Combined Test
In England, Scotland and Wales, you will be offered a test to screen your baby for genetic abnormalities. Genetic means that the condition is passed on through special codes inside cells called genes.
The conditions which are checked for are:
Down's syndrome, also called trisomy 21.
Down's syndrome, also called trisomy 21.
Edwards' syndrome, also called trisomy 18.
Edwards' syndrome, also called trisomy 18.
Patau's syndrome, also called trisomy 13.
Patau's syndrome, also called trisomy 13.
The test is called the combined test because it combines a blood test and an ultrasound scan. The ultrasound scan measures the fluid at the back of the baby's neck to determining the "nuchal translucency". The combined test can be done between 10 and 14 weeks at the same time as the blood tests and scan mentioned above. Your age and the results of these two tests are used to work out the chance of your baby having Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome.
If you miss this time window, these conditions can also be screened for with a blood test between 14 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. This is called the quadruple test and only screens for Down's syndrome. It is less accurate than the combined test. In Northern Ireland some centres offer these tests in the same way, or you may be able to request them within the same time frames.
Down's syndrome
Down's syndrome is a genetic chromosomal problem that some people are born with. A person with Down's syndrome can usually be recognised by their typical features. It can also cause learning disability and certain medical problems. Someone with Down's syndrome has an extra copy of chromosome number 21 in the cells of their body.
Edwards' and Patau's syndrome
Babies with Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome number 18 or 13 respectively. Unfortunately, babies with Edwards' or Patau's syndromes have severe abnormalities and do not usually survive very long.
Pregnancy screening test results
The combined test results will provide you with information on the risk of your unborn baby having Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome. It does not give you a definite diagnosis or a definite answer. The test tells you if your baby has a higher chance or lower chance of having one of these conditions.
A lower chance result does not mean there is no chance of your baby having Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome. It means the chance is less than 1 in 150.
If your combined test result shows that the chance of having a baby with Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome is more than 1 in 150 this is called a higher chance result. This does not mean your baby definitely does have one of these syndromes. You will then be offered further tests which you can choose whether to have or not.
There is a second screening test called non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). This can give you a more accurate screening result which might help you to decide whether to go on to have a diagnostic test or not.
Only diagnostic tests will give you a definite answer (these are amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling. These are not screening tests. They are, however, included here as they may be offered if a screening test is abnormal. Diagnostic tests are invasive prenatal tests and carry a small risk of miscarriage (approximately 1 in 200).
You do not have to have a screening test for Down's syndrome or other genetic conditions if you do not want one. If you have a screening test and it shows a higher chance of Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome you do not have to a diagnostic test. Find out more about prenatal screening and diagnosis of Down's syndrome.
A final point
The above tests are the usual routine tests offered to all pregnant women. If you have symptoms or problems which suggest pregnancy complications, various other examinations and tests may be advised. See your midwife or doctor if you have any concerns about your pregnancy, or if you wish to discuss any tests in more detail.

An ultrasound scan is a painless test that uses sound waves to create images of organs and structures inside your body. It is a very commonly used test. As it uses sound waves it is thought to be very safe.
Doppler and duplex scans are used to visualise blood or fluids flowing through the body.
Note: the information below is a general guide only. The arrangements, and the way tests are performed, may vary between different hospitals. Always follow the instructions given by your doctor or local hospital.

Guide internal biopsies. A biopsy is a procedure in which a sample of tissue is taken. Some biopsies are taken using a thin needle, and the needle is guided to the right place with an ultrasound scan. For example, if you have a lump in your breast, you may have a sample of the lump taken away. The sample is then examined under the microscope to see if your lump is cancerous or not.

Some specialist ultrasound techniques
In some situations, a clearer picture can be obtained from a probe that is within the body. So a small probe, still attached by a wire to the ultrasound machine, can be:
Swallowed into the gullet (oesophagus). This may be used to obtain clearer images of the internal organs, particularly the stomach, upper gut and pancreas.

Ultrasound may also be used for treating certain conditions, particularly those of muscles, tendons and joints. The scan may be used to guide an injection which can help to treat the problem.
Doing the injection with the help of an ultrasound scan makes sure it reaches exactly the right place. For example, ultrasound-guided injections are a common way to treat shoulder problems such as a frozen shoulder.
The above are not exhaustive lists, and ultrasound scanning has other uses.
Preparing for an ultrasound scan
Usually there is no special preparation needed. Continue to take your usual medication. You should eat and drink normally before and after the test unless otherwise instructed. For example:
If certain parts of the tummy (abdomen) are being examined, you may be asked to eat a low-fibre diet for a day or so before the test (to minimise 'gas' in your gut).

You will be told what you need to do before any particular scan.
How does ultrasound work?
Ultrasound travels freely through fluid and soft tissues. However, ultrasound bounces back (is reflected back) as echoes when it hits a more solid (dense) surface. For example, the ultrasound will travel freely though blood in a heart chamber. But, when it hits a solid valve, a lot of the ultrasound echoes back.
Another example is that when ultrasound travels though bile in a gallbladder it will echo back strongly if it hits a solid gallstone - as in the ultrasound image below. The arrow points to a gallstone in the gallbladder.
Gallstone ultrasound image

So, as ultrasound 'hits' different structures of different density in the body, it sends back echoes of varying strength.
What does an ultrasound scan involve?
You lie on a couch and an operator places a probe on your skin over the part of your body to be examined. The probe is a bit like a very thick blunt pen. Lubricating jelly is put on your skin so that the probe makes good contact with your body. The image below shows an ultrasound scan of the neck.
Neck ultrasound scan

The probe is connected by a wire to the ultrasound machine, which is linked to a monitor. Pulses of ultrasound are sent from the probe through the skin into your body. The ultrasound waves then bounce back as echoes from the various structures in the body.
The echoes are detected by the probe and are sent down the wire to the ultrasound machine.
Ultrasound scanning machine
By Daniel W Rickey, via Wikimedia Commons
They are displayed as a picture on the monitor. The picture is constantly updated so the scan can show movement as well as structure. For example, the valves of a heart opening and closing during a scan of the heart.
The operator moves the probe around over the surface of the skin to obtain views from different angles.
The scan is painless and takes about 15-45 minutes, depending on which parts of the body are being examined. A record of the results of the test can be made as still pictures or as a video recording, and a report summarising the finding will also be written.
What is a Doppler ultrasound scan?
A Doppler ultrasound records sound waves reflecting off moving objects, such as blood cells, to measure their speed and other aspects of how they flow through the body.
How does Doppler ultrasound work?
If the structure is moving then the echo comes back at a slightly different frequency (called the Doppler effect). This difference in frequency can be used to measure the speed of movement.
Blood moving in an artery or vein causes small echoes and these are used to measure the speed of movement of the blood cells. The sound waves may be amplified though speakers.
This allows the practitioner to listen to the flow of blood cells to determine whether or not there is normal flow. For example, listening to the flow of blood through the heart of a baby during a routine antenatal check-up.
The sound waves may also be converted to colour pictures on a screen so that flow can be seen through the arteries or veins (colour Doppler) - as below.

They may also be plotted on a graph showing changes in speed and direction (velocity).

What does a Doppler ultrasound involve?
During pregnancy, the Doppler ultrasound is very similar to an ultrasound scan. A probe covered with gel is put on your skin over the pregnant womb (uterus). This is connected to a speaker. You and the practitioner are able to listen to the flow of blood through the baby's heart.
During a Doppler ultrasound of the arms and legs, blood pressure cuffs are placed along the thigh, calf, or ankle, or to different points along the arm. A paste is applied to the skin over the arteries being examined. Images are created as the probe is moved over each area.
What is duplex ultrasound?
Duplex ultrasound is a special technique which combines traditional ultrasound with Doppler ultrasound. Images of the solid object being examined - for example, the artery and the blood flowing through it - are displayed on a screen or monitor.
The object is usually grey and the blood flow is usually in colour (colour Doppler).
What is duplex ultrasound used for?
Duplex ultrasound is most commonly used to evaluate the blood flow in various arteries and veins in the body. The scan can help diagnose the following conditions:
Widening of the main artery in the tummy (abdominal aortic aneurysm). Ultrasound scans are used in the national screening programmes across the UK for abdominal aortic aneurysm.

What does a duplex ultrasound involve?
This test is very similar to an ultrasound scan. A probe covered with gel is placed over the area to be examined. Images of the solid organ and the blood flowing through it are then seen on a monitor.
Are there any side-effects?
These scans are painless and safe. Unlike X-rays and other imaging tests, they do not use radiation. They have not been found to cause any problems or complications.
What happens after an ultrasound scan?
The person operating the scanning machine will have put some jelly on to your skin at the start of the procedure. Once the scan is completed, this jelly will be wiped off and you can get dressed and leave.
The scan operator sometimes talks to you during the scan, so you may immediately have an idea of what was found. A report also needs to be written and this is sent to the person who ordered your scan - your GP or specialist team.
They will be able to discuss your result when you see them next. The results are normally available within a couple of weeks. It is important that you get the result from the team who requested your scan - so if the scan was requested by a hospital consultant, you should contact their secretary for the result, not your GP.
