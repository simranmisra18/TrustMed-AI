Hoping someone out there can relate. I am in a bad time right now. A lot of PVC’s day and night. What is so troubling is how these can feel like your heart is fluttering - how is that? Also, the strength of some of these. Last night when I went to bed I had 4 skips in a row that were so hard. They felt like my heart was going to explode. That’s the kind of thing that can bring on anxiety. I find it odd how many skip beats I am having at night too. They wake me up several times during the night no matter what position I am in.
Can anyone else relate? Thanks
