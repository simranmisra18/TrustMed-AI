Botulinum toxin is commercially available as Botox® or Dysport®. However, these injections are commonly referred to as 'Botox' whichever product is actually used. This leaflet will therefore refer only to 'Botox'.
What is Botox?
Botox® and Dysport® are the trade names for Botulinum toxin, produced by a bacterium called Clostridium botulinum. Several types of toxins have been identified, but type A, which is used commercially, is the most potent.
Botox was first used in 1978 to weaken overactive muscles in the eye, followed by other neurological conditions such as dystonia and hemifacial spasm with good effects and few little side effects. Botox was first used cosmetically in 1990, to reduce facial wrinkles arising from muscle contraction.
What are wrinkles?
Wrinkles are part of the ageing process. They can be attributed to sun damage, effects of gravity and muscle contraction resulting from facial expressions such as frowning and laughing.
Wrinkles due to the effects of gravity represent natural sagging of tissue with age and are generally only improved by surgical tightening procedures. Wrinkles caused by muscle contraction such as frown lines between the eyebrows, forehead lines and crow's feet, can be improved by Botox treatment.
The various wrinkles caused by facial muscle contraction are illustrated on diagram 1. Botox can also be used to treat excessive sweating of the armpits and palms of the hands.
Botox injections
How does botox work?
Botox acts by blocking acetylcholine, a chemical that is responsible for transmitting electrical impulses that cause muscle contractions. This results in muscle paralysis which is temporary, because new growth of nerves will re-innervate the muscles.
How long does botox take to work?
Botox usually takes effect 24-72 hours after injection, with maximum effect at about 1 to 2 weeks. Its effects generally last for approximately 3-4 months. When injected into the muscles that are responsible for expression wrinkles, it gives the face a more relaxed and smoother appearance.
Sometimes longer lasting effects (9-12 months) are seen after treatment of excessive sweating. When a gradual fading of treatment effect is noticed you may return to have another treatment.
What can you expect at the time of your procedure?
Botox is injected directly into the muscles that cause the wrinkles, using a very small needle. Several injections are usually needed at specific injection sites, depending on the area treated (see diagram 1). When used to treat excessive sweating in the armpits, Botox is injected directed into the axillary skin. Localised discomfort and bruises can occur, but no sedation or local anaesthesia is generally required. Normal activities can be resumed immediately.
What are the limitations?
Whilst Botox can be very safe and effective way to reduce wrinkles due to muscle contractions, it has no effect in reducing the fine lines on the face caused by sun damage, and lines due to sagging of facial skin. In those patients with very heavy lines, repeated treatments may be needed for maximum effect.
Too frequent or excessive dosing of Botox may lead to a patient's resistance to treatment due to antibody formation. Botox treatment may also exaggerate any facial asymmetry and make the face look more lop-sided.
Who should not have botox?
The use of Botox is not recommended for:
People with neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis.
People with neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis.
Those who are taking certain medications; muscle relaxants, antibiotics such as aminoglycosides (eg, gentamicin).

Pregnant or breastfeeding women.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women.
Those with infection or inflammation at the proposed site of injections.
Those with infection or inflammation at the proposed site of injections.
People who have bleeding disorders.
People who have bleeding disorders.
Is botox safe?
No severe complications after cosmetic use of Botox have been reported in the literature. Very rarely excessive weakening of the target muscles and paresis of adjacent muscles can occur, resulting in facial weakness. This is self-limiting. When injecting above the eyebrows, upper eyelid ptosis or slight drooping may occur but only 1:100. This can be corrected with eyedrops but will also improve as the effects of the Botox wear off.

What you should do when you go home
Surgery to reshape the nose is a very common plastic surgery procedure and it can both increase or decrease the size of nose. The shape of the tip, the bridge and also the nostrils can be changed as can the angle between the nose and the upper lip. Sometimes breathing difficulties can be corrected at the same time.
The nose is the central feature of the face; many people are self-conscious of shape which they may regard as too big, too small or have some other feature which they dislike. The characteristics of the nose are inherited from parents and develop during adolescent years. It continues until the age of 16, when the nose stops growing. It is, therefore, unwise to operate before this age.
What can be done?
An operation called reduction rhinoplasty reduces the size of the framework of the nose over which the skin is draped. The skin itself is not touched. The frame of the nose which is made up of bone in its upper half and gristle (cartilage) in its lower half is approached from underneath the skin through cuts which are made inside the nostrils. Think of the frame of the nose as being like the roof of a house. In order to straighten the nose and bring its bridge closer to the face, its "ridge" is cut away. Then, to restore a new ''ridge'' or bridge-line, the two sides of the nose are bought together by cutting the bones of the nose where they join on to the cheek bones. The elasticity of the overlying skin allows it to shrink down on the smaller frame.
This operation effectively narrows the width of the nose. If doing so makes the nostrils seem too wide, it may be necessary to narrow them as well by cutting out a small piece of skin in the floor of the nostril which would leave a fine scar on each side. It is also possible to shorten the nose and to slim down a bulky tip by reducing the amount of cartilage which shapes the end of the the nose. If you have some difficulty breathing through your nose, it may be possible to improve this at the same time by adjusting the lie of the plate of the bone which separates one half of your nose from the other. This is referred to as a septoplasty. Sometimes the size of the nose as a feature of the face is influenced by the proportions of the other features, such as the chin and the cheek bones, and to ''normalise'' the appearance of the face it may be advisable to alter these features as well, either at the same time as the rhinoplasty, or during a separate operation.
What are the consequences?
There is always some bruising and swelling, particularly around the eyes, which can take up to three weeks to completely disappear and you would need to wear a firm splint over your nose during part of this time. By the end of three weeks, swelling will have settled sufficiently for you to look normal to others and as if you had not had recent surgery. Indeed, it is likely that you will be surprised by the absence of other people's reactions to the fact that you have a new nose. They, of course, have not been self-conscious of your nose as you have been. If you have any anxieties about family and friends noticing a change in your appearance, change your hairstyle at the same time and they will think it is that which accounts for your new looks.
It is worth anticipating your own reaction to the first sight of yourself and your new nose. To start with, you will look rather strange in the mirror and not quite 'you' because of your different nose. Remember that it takes a few days for your mind's eye to adjust itself to your new appearance and to recognise it as 'you'. You should also bear in mind that it takes a good three months or more for all the swelling to settle out of the nose so, if there are any minor problems of shape soon after the operation, do not worry, they will almost certainly improve with time. Your nose will also feel rather numb and stiff for several months, particularly around the tip.
What are the limitations?
The object of the operation is to make your nose look right for your eyes so that you lose your self-consciousness of it. It is, therefore, most important that you are clear in your mind what it is that you dislike about the appearance of your nose and that you are able to explain this to your surgeon. He or she will then be able to tell you what is surgically possible and what is not. For instance, if the skin on the tip of your nose is thick and oily, it may not be possible to reduce its bulky appearance as much as you might like because, generally speaking, it is not possible to thin the skin without leaving scars.
If you are in middle age or if you have a very large nose, there may be a limit to the amount of reduction that can be achieved to the size of your nose within the limitations of the elasticity of your skin to shrink down on the smaller frame.
If your nose is bent from previous injury, it may not be possible you make it perfectly straight. Large nostrils can be difficult to reduce without cutting the skin and leaving noticeable scars.
What are the risks?
Like any operation that is carried out under general anaesthetic, there is a small risk of chest infection, particularly among people who smoke. There is a small risk that infection could complicate the operation. You can minimise this risk by ensuring that you are free from cough, cold or sore throat at the time of your operation and, if you have any doubts, you should contact your surgeon.
Occasionally, the operation is complicated by heavy nose bleeding either shortly afterwards or after a week to 10 days which may require treatment in hospital.
It is quite common for there to be some difficulty with breathing through the nose during the first week after the operation which disappears as the swelling settles. Occasionally, though, the difficulty persists and can be permanent.
Sometimes (in about 10% of patients) the nose does not look right for the patient after all the swelling has settled. In these cases, it is usually possible for the surgeon to carry out a second operation to the residual problem of appearance but, not until all swelling has settled from the first operation. Most surgeons wait for a year for this to happen. Secondary surgery like this may involve additional expense.
What you should do when you go home
You can expect to have some minor bleeding from your nose for the first day or two after your operation and you should dab this away gently with gauze squares or a clean handkerchief. Keep your head up as much as possible and avoid having hot baths. Do not blow your nose and try your best not to sneeze through your nose. If you are going to sneeze, cough it out. Once the dressings have been removed from the nostrils, you can clear your nose by sniffing into the back of your throat if you wish. Unless you are advised otherwise, it is better to leave any crusts in your nostrils until you see your surgeon for removal of the splint 1-2 weeks after the operation.
Although there is no medical reason for you to stay away from work for more than a few days, you will probably feel more comfortable if you take two weeks off and go back when the bruising has gone. Cosmetic surgery is carried out by members of several different organisations and therefore your general practitioner is the best person to advise you on whom you should see.

The size of women's breasts may be determined by several factors, such as inherited genes, body weight and hormonal influences. They can, therefore, be a problem to some women early in adolescence or may not become uncomfortable until middle age following the menopause or the use of HRT. The problem of large breasts, however, may cause similar problems at all ages and these are chiefly backache, neck pain, grooves in the shoulders from bra straps, rashes under the breasts and the feeling of self-consciousness. Because of the sexual nature of breasts the undue prominence may attract unwanted attention from the opposite sex, comments and sexual innuendoes. These can cause psychological distress to many women. One of the commonest complaints of women with large breasts is that it is very difficult to wear fashionable clothes and indulge in active sports, particularly in the summer months.
Breast reduction new
What can be done?
Reduction mammoplasty is an operation which removes the excess fat and skin from the breasts, which are reshaped and the nipples repositioned to form newer smaller breasts. This should result in more attractive breasts and reduce many of the problems outlined above. There are several different surgical designs to reshape the breasts. All of them will involve a scar around the areola of the breast. Each method will use different scars and will have advantages and disadvantages and your surgeon may select with your approval the best technique in your particular case. Reduction mammoplasty may be used to correct asymmetry of the breast, where one breast is very much larger than the other and where it is considered to be the least normal of the two.
What are the consequences?
Apart from the change of shape and reduction in size the most obvious consequences are the scars. These are designed to be invisible whilst wearing normal clothing and as far as possible are designed to lie under the average bra or bikini top. Over the months following surgery the scars will fade from being red, possibly thick and uncomfortable, to becoming much more pale and less obvious. However, they will always be present and visible when clothing is not worn and the scars will vary from one woman to another. In some they may be very thin, in others they may stretch and become quite red and possibly ugly. In the vast majority of women, however, the scars are acceptable and a small trade off for the benefit of dealing with the problems of large breasts. Very few women are able to breast feed following breast reduction surgery as the nipples are separated from the underlying milk ducts and at the time of pregnancy the milk supply will gradually dry up, sometimes with the assistance of hormone treatment. Breast reduction is no contra-indication to pregnancy but young women may well wish to take the fact that they are unable to breast feed into account before embarking on this procedure.
The nipples are likely to be very much less sensitive following surgery due to the nature of the cuts and the nerve supply and it is quite possible that numbness will extend over part of the breast as well.
Will the improvement last?
Unless your operation is done at an age when your breasts are still growing, they should not regrow afterwards. They will, however, increase in size if you either put on weight or become pregnant and decrease in size if you lose weight. Even normal breasts have a tendency to droop with time and you can expect some change in shape to occur after a reduction mammoplasty. You can delay this tendency by supporting your breasts in well-fitting bras.
What are the limitations?
It is very important that you discuss thoroughly with your surgeon beforehand the size of breasts you wish to achieve. Many women wish for a very radical reduction but in order to achieve this the shape and aesthetic quality of the breasts may be compromised. It is also possible that there may be a degree of asymmetry. This is often less than existed before the surgery. In women with very large breasts the benefits of a significant reduction may outweigh the potential imperfections of poor shape and loss of nipple function and sensitivity. However, in women with breasts which are only slightly larger than normal very careful thought must be given to the scarring and the potential shape and size as the outcome of the surgery may not be as aesthetically pleasing as a normal breast appearance.
What are the risks?
Any major operation with a general anaesthetic carries a small risk of chest infection particularly among people who smoke and there is also a small risk of thrombosis in the veins of the leg, particularly for patients who are taking the contraceptive pill.
Occasionally, heavy bleeding can occur after the operation is finished which may need a further operation and a blood transfusion.
Occasionally, infection from germs harbouring in the ducts of the breast can be troublesome. Infection can be treated with antibiotics but it will delay the healing process, scars are likely to be worse to start with and there may be a need to restitch them at a later date. If you have a discharge from your nipple, it is most important to tell your surgeon about it before your operation.
Occasionally, skin can become sloughy and form a scab which gradually separates to leave a broad scar. The nipple disc and the skin where the scar meets underneath the breast are parts most likely to be affected. People who smoke are at greater risk of this happening. Usually the scars settle well to end up as white lines but they will always be noticeable. However, some people have an inborn tendency for scars to stretch and sometimes they can stay thick, red and irritable for a long time. You need to ask your consultant if you are at increased risk of developing this complication.
When reducing large breasts it may occasionally be necessary to adjust the folds of skin at the end of the scar, both between the breasts and at the sides. This can simply be carried out under local anaesthetic several months later.
There is no evidence that reduction mammoplasty causes breast cancer. Nor does it prevent your breast from being examined for cancer in the usual way.
What you should do before your operation?
Your surgeon is likely to recommend that you reduce weight if you are overweight and to make alternative arrangements if you are on the contraceptive pill. Smoking does seriously affect the healing of the breast wounds and should be discouraged and attempts to give it up made.
What can you expect at the time of the operation?
This procedure is carried out under a general anaesthetic and when you wake at the end of the operation there will be some discomfort which will last for two or three days. You will be given suitable painkilling injections or tablets. Drainage tubes are frequently used and will be removed within a short period of time. You may need to remain in hospital for three to four days. The stitches will normally be removed between ten to fourteen days and you will be tired and require help at home for a period of time, from two to six weeks depending on your age and general fitness. A well-fitting bra will need to be worn following surgery but because of the post-operative swelling the final size of your breasts may not be obvious for several weeks. There is likely to be some tenderness and lumpiness of the breasts for several weeks or even months following surgery but there is no reason why you cannot sunbathe and go swimming once the scars have fully healed.
Cosmetic surgery is carried out by members of several different organisations and, therefore, your general practitioner is the best person to advise you on whom you should see.

Complications and problems
The future
Traditional methods for removing unwanted body hair include shaving, waxing, the application of depilatory cream and electrolysis. Depilation by laser is a relatively new technique. It helps not only those with normal hair growth, but also those with excessive hairiness of the body or face, a condition called hirsutism which causes considerable psychological distress.
Hirsutism affects approximately 10% of women between the ages of 18 and 35. In most cases there is no obvious cause but some patients may have a hormonal disturbance. Hirsutism may also be a feature of the menopause. Unwanted hair is a significant problem for transsexuals and transvestites, and many males with hair on their back dislike it intensely. Children with hairy moles of the face or lumbar spine area are often teased.
Hair biology
Hair biology
The hair grows in cycles, alternating between a growing phase (anagen) and a quiescent phase (telogen); catagen is the period of transition between the two.
Cells half way up the hair follicle are thought to be responsible for hair growth. The depilation laser delivers a particular wavelength of laser light which targets the pigment in the hair. This light penetrates up to a millimetre beneath the skin where it is absorbed by the pigment in the part of the hair root which is important for growth.
Hairs come in a variety of thicknesses and colours according to the pigment they contain. Black and laser light penetrates through the skin and is preferentially absorbed by the hair.
The stem cells responsible for hair growth are thought to be located at the attachment of the erector pili muscle to the follicle. The brown hairs contain most pigment and are easiest to treat. Grey or blonde hair has little pigment and is unlikely to respond to treatment.
Treatment
Treatment may be a little uncomfortable - it feels a little like an elastic band snapping against the skin - but some patients prefer to use local anaesthetic cream to numb the area first. Aloe vera gel may also be used during or after treatment for its cooling effect. Some lasers have a cooling system which reduces the discomfort of the treatment.
After treatment, the treated area may look red and feel warm and tender. This feeling goes after a couple of hours, but in a few patients, particularly those with dark skin, blistering and crusting of the skin sometimes occur after laser treatment. Some hairs disappear at the treatment session; others, which initially look curled up or "frazzled" may take a few days to fall out.
Types of laser
A variety of laser systems are now available. Ruby lasers, Alexandrite lasers, Nd-YAG lasers and white light machines can all be used to remove hair with varying degrees of success. The size of the area covered by each pulse of laser energy varies with the machine used.
Results
Initial reports of laser hair removal were extremely promising, and some research went so far as to claim that it may be permanent, but this is generally not the case. A few patients do not respond to the laser treatment at all but many will have good results. Regrowth is not only less dense but also less coarse. In the ideal patient, with dark hair and pale skin, the hair usually disappears for two to three months and then slowly regrows. Repeat treatment is usually required several times a year.
Safety
When laser treatment is carried out it is essential that all those within the treatment room, you and the staff, should wear protective goggles or glasses. Entry to the room is strictly controlled whilst treatment is being given.
Complications and problems
Laser light can damage the skin's pigment and sometimes the treatment area may become unusually pale or dark several months after treatment. For this reason, it is always wise to carry out a small trial of treatment in an unobtrusive area before proceeding to extensive treatment. The test patch is examined six to eight weeks later for unwanted side effects and to carefully assess success before proceeding to further treatment. Special care is needed when treating patients with black or brown skin. The Nd-YAG laser may be most suitable for dark skins as it causes less skin damage. After treatment you should stay out of the sun as exposure of recently laser treated skin to strong sunshine may increase the risk of pigmentation problems.
The future
At present many patients derive great benefit from laser hair removal, achieving hair-free intervals of up to three months. Further research is likely to improve results in the future. Permanency, the gold standard of hair removal, seems to be some way off however.
