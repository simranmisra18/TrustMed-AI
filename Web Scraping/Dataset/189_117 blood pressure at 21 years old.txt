the other night my BP was 189/117 with tachycardia and palpitations. i went to a&e but got discharged after a few hours as my HR went down to 120 and BP was like 140/90. no one seemed concerned that my BP was so high to begin with and didnt seem to want to investigate but now im very worried as im only 21 with an unknown heart issue
