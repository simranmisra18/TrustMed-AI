Tonsillitis is an infection of the tonsils that causes them to become swollen and sore. It is usually caused by a virus, but can also be caused by bacterial infections. Most cases improve within a week with rest, fluids, and pain relief, however, bacterial tonsillitis may require antibiotics. This leaflet discusses the symptoms, causes, treatments, and when to see a doctor.

Key points
Tonsillitis is an infection of the tonsils. Common symptoms include a sore throat, fever, pain when swallowing, and swollen tonsils (sometimes with white spots). It can affect adults and children, and often clears up within a week.

What are tonsils?
Tonsils are made of soft gland tissue and they are part of the body's defence against infections (the immune system). There are two tonsils, one on either side at the back of the mouth.

How long does tonsillitis last?
Tonsillitis normally goes after 4-5 days. Tonsillitis treatment can ease the symptoms until the infection goes. Medical advice should be sought if the symptoms are severe or don't get better quickly.
What causes tonsillitis?
Tonsillitis can be caused by:
Viral infections such as colds and flu.
Viral infections such as colds and flu.
Bacterial infections such as group A streptococcus - which can cause scarlet fever, and very rarely in the UK, rheumatic fever.
Bacterial infections such as group A streptococcus - which can cause scarlet fever, and very rarely in the UK, rheumatic fever.
Glandular fever
Glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis - or 'mono') is caused by a virus - the Epstein-Barr virus. It tends to cause a severe bout of tonsillitis as well as other symptoms. See the separate leaflet called Glandular fever (Infectious mononucleosis) for more details.
Is tonsillitis contagious?
Contagious means that the infection can be passed to someone else. Tonsillitis is contagious so infection may spread by close physical contact with other people, or by droplets in the air, caused by sneezing or coughing.
As with coughs, colds, flu and other similar infections, the virus that has caused the tonsillitis can be passed to others. Normal hygiene advice such as washing hands after coughing or sneezing would apply.
Tonsillitis treatment
Mild tonsillitis doesn't need any specific treatment. It is important to drink plenty of water. Also:
Paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen will help to ease the pain, headache, and high temperature.

Antibiotics can kill bacteria but do not kill viruses. Even when tonsillitis is caused by a bacteria, treatment with an antibiotic does not make much difference in terms of the length or severity of the illness. However, if the antibiotic prescribing criteria are met, a doctor may prescribe antibiotics.
With repeated bouts of tonsillitis, surgery may be considered to surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy).
Will tonsillitis go away on its own?
Yes. Most tonsil infections are mild and soon get better on their own. Even when the tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, it will usually get better on its own.
At home treatments
Treatment options include:
Have plenty to drink. It is tempting not to drink very much if it is painful to swallow. If not drinking enough, this may cause mild dehydration, particularly alongside a high temperature (fever). This can make headaches and tiredness much worse.

Paracetamol or ibuprofen eases pain, headache and fever. To keep symptoms to a minimum it is best to take a dose at regular intervals as recommended on the packet of medication rather than now and then. For example, take paracetamol four times a day - at least 4-6 hours apart - until symptoms ease. Although either paracetamol or ibuprofen will usually help, there is some evidence to suggest that ibuprofen may be more effective than paracetamol at easing symptoms in adults. Paracetamol is usually the preferred first-line option for children, but ibuprofen can be used as an alternative. Note: some people with certain conditions may not be able to take ibuprofen. So, always read the packet label. See the leaflet Fever in children (High temperature) or Fever treatment for children: a doctor's advice for further information.

Tonsillitis antibiotics
Most throat and tonsil infections are caused by viruses, although some are caused by bacteria. Viral infections cannot be treated with antibiotics. A swab can identify whether the infection is caused by a virus or a bacteria.
Even if a bacterial infection is the cause of tonsillitis, an antibiotic does not make much difference in most cases. The body's defences (immune system) usually clear these infections within a few days whether caused it is by a virus or a bacterium. Also, antibiotics can often cause side-effects such as diarrhoea, rash and stomach upsets.
The bacteria which tends to cause tonsillitis is a streptococcus. This is why sometimes people refer to tonsillitis as a "strep throat".
People commonly think that tonsillitis needs to be treated with antibiotics. This is not true. Studies have shown that, in patients who were not prescribed antibiotics, 40 out of 100 of them were completely better in 3 days and 80 out of 100 were better in a week. This was the same whether or not their tonsillitis was caused by a bacteria (strep) or a virus. On average, the antibiotics reduced the length of symptoms by 16 hours but caused more side effects.
Another study showed that 200 people needed to be treated with antibiotics in order to prevent one complication and that the majority of these complications were very mild (for example, an ear infection). On the other hand, only 37 people need to be treated with antibiotics to cause harm from the antibiotics.
There is also evidence that the overuse of antibiotics for self-limiting conditions like tonsillitis can reduce the effectiveness of the immune system and make people more prone to future infections.
There are two scoring systems which may be used to help decide how likely an episode is bacterial. These are called the FeverPAIN score and the Centor score.
An antibiotic may be advised in certain situations. For example:
If the infection is severe.
If the infection is severe.
If it is not easing after a few days.
If it is not easing after a few days.
If the immune system is not working properly (for example, if you have had your spleen removed, if you are taking chemotherapy, etc).

If living in an area of the world where rheumatic fever is common (some low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, South East Asia and the Western Pacific).
It can often feel as though antibiotics are needed because the tonsillitis settled quickly after getting antibiotics on a previous occasion - however, this is usually just because of the timeframe - people usually wait 2-3 days before seeking medical help and the vast majority of tonsillitis infections will settle within 3-5 days. For most people, fluids and painkillers are enough.
Recurrent tonsillitis
Guidelines suggest removing the tonsils may be an option (tonsillectomy) if there have been:
Seven or more episodes of tonsillitis in the preceding year; or
Seven or more episodes of tonsillitis in the preceding year; or
Five or more such episodes in each of the preceding two years; or
Five or more such episodes in each of the preceding two years; or
Three or more such episodes in each of the preceding three years.
Three or more such episodes in each of the preceding three years.

An episode of quinsy.
The tonsils and adenoids may be removed at the same time. The adenoids are also part of the body's defence against infections (the immune system). Adenoids hang from the upper part of the back of the nasal cavity. See the separate leaflet called What do tonsils do? for more details.
Although full-blown episodes of tonsillitis are prevented after tonsillectomy, other throat infections are not prevented. However, the overall number and severity of throat infections may be reduced.
Also, the risk of developing quinsy is reduced. Many people say they generally feel better in themselves after having their tonsils removed if they previously had frequent episodes of chronic tonsillitis.
Tonsillectomy risks
Tonsillectomy is usually a straightforward minor operation. But, as with all operations, there is a risk. There is a small risk of life-threatening severe bleeding from the throat during or just after the operation.
When should you contact a doctor about tonsillitis?
Medical advice should be sought if symptoms of a sore throat cause severe symptoms (despite painkillers), or if they do not ease within 3-4 days. In particular, urgent medical attention should be sought if there is:
Difficulty in breathing.

What is the outlook for tonsillitis?
In nearly all cases, a tonsillitis or sore throat settles without leaving any problems. However, occasionally tonsillitis may progress to cause a complication. Also, a sore throat can sometimes be due to an unusual, but more serious, illness.
Sometimes the infection can spread from the tonsils to other nearby tissues. For example, to cause an ear infection, sinus infection or chest infection.
What is quinsy?
Quinsy is also known as peritonsillar abscess. Quinsy is a condition where a collection of pus (abscess) develops next to a tonsil. This is caused by a bacterial infection.
It usually develops just on one side. It may follow a tonsillitis or develop without tonsillitis.
It usually develops just on one side. It may follow a tonsillitis or develop without tonsillitis.
The tonsil on the affected side may be swollen or look normal, but is pushed towards the middle by the abscess next to the tonsil. Quinsy is very painful and can make you feel very unwell.

Frequently asked questions
How serious is tonsillitis in adults?
In most adults, tonsillitis is not serious and usually improves within a week. However, adults may experience more severe symptoms or complications than children.
What antibiotics are used to treat tonsillitis?
Most cases of tonsillitis do not need antibiotics because they are usually caused by a virus and clear up on their own. When needed, common antibiotics used in the UK are: penicillin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin.
What is the difference between tonsillitis and strep?
Tonsillitis is the inflammation of the tonsils, whereas strep throat is a specific infection caused by group A streptococcus that often leads to tonsillitis, but can also affect the throat more generally.
Does tonsillitis cause a cough?
Viral tonsillitis is often associated with symptoms like a cough and a cold. Bacterial tonsillitis however, does not usually cause a cough and it is one of the criteria that is used to decide how likely a bacterial infection is.
Is tonsillitis worse at night?
Sore throats often feel worse at night. This may because the painkillers have worn off. It may also be that people sleep with their mouth open and, therefore, their mouth tends to be dry, which can add to the pain. Having water by the bed and taking painkillers just before going to bed can help.
Ear, nose and throat
Whether it's a sharp sting in the back of the throat when swallowing, or a constant ache that nothing seems to shift, one thing is certain - sore throats are a literal pain in the neck. We look at the symptoms and causes of sore throats and when to worry.

Ear, nose and throat
Epiglottitis is the term used to describe inflammation and swelling of the epiglottis which lies just behind the root of the tongue. It is usually caused by infection with a bacteria. The usual symptoms are a severe sore throat, pain or difficulty swallowing and a high temperature (fever). Breathing difficulties can occur. Prompt treatment is needed to ensure that enough oxygen can reach the lungs and usually includes antibiotics. If epiglottitis is treated quickly, the outlook is generally very good. Untreated, it can be life-threatening. Since immunisation against Hib was introduced, the number of children who develop epiglottitis in the UK has reduced dramatically.

Frequently Asked Questions
What is laryngitis?
Laryngitis means inflammation and irritation of the larynx, which is commonly referred to as the voice box or vocal cords in your throat. Most cases of laryngitis are caused by a virus infection but there are many other possible causes (see 'Laryngitis causes' below). When caused by a virus infection, it usually starts suddenly and resolves within 1-2 weeks.
What is laryngitis?
What is the larynx?
Your larynx is made of two bands of muscles which stretch across the top of your windpipe (trachea) in your upper respiratory tract. The movements and vibrations of those muscles, called the vocal cords, allow you to talk.
If your voice box becomes swollen or inflamed, usually due to a viral infection, you can't talk properly anymore. Your voice may become croaky or squeaky, and you may find you cannot talk as loudly as usual.
Laryngitis symptoms
Common symptoms of laryngitis include:
Sore throat or soreness at the front of your neck.

Some people are alarmed by their trouble speaking. However, it is only temporary whilst the vocal cords are inflamed during the infection.
Sometimes laryngitis is part of a more widespread infection. For example, you may also have a sore throat (pharyngitis), tonsillitis, a cold or flu-like illness. In these situations, you may also have other symptoms such as:
A headache.

Is laryngitis contagious?
When laryngitis is caused by an infection (for example, a virus), the infection can be contagious. However, the types of infection that cause laryngitis are not usually highly contagious ones.
These types of infection are usually spread through respiratory droplets, propelled through the air when a person coughs or sneezes. The infection may also be present in saliva and passed on through kissing.
How long does laryngitis last?
Viral laryngitis typically gets worse over 2-3 days. It then eases and goes away, usually within a week. However, you may have a croaky voice for a week or so even after the other symptoms have gone. This is because the inflammation of the vocal cords can take a while to settle after the virus has gone.
Laryngitis treatment
Not treating is an option. As laryngitis usually gets better within a few days, you could try to wait for the symptoms to go away on their own.

Drink plenty of fluids. It is tempting not to drink very much if it is painful to swallow. You may become mildly dry (dehydrated) if you don't drink much. Mild dehydration can make headaches and tiredness much worse. Also, if your voice box (larynx) becomes dry, the inflammation gets worse. Chewing sugar-free gum can also help prevent your larynx from becoming dry.

Aspirin gargles. This will do little to ease soreness in the larynx. This is because a gargle does not touch the larynx; it only touches the back of the throat. However, it may ease a sore throat if you have this together with laryngitis. (There is little research evidence to confirm that aspirin gargles are effective for sore throat. However, it is a popular treatment and may be worth a try.) If used, dissolve some soluble aspirin in water and gargle for 3-4 minutes. You can do this 3-4 times a day. Spit out the aspirin after gargling. (Note: you should not give aspirin to children aged less than 16 years.)

Breathing in moisturised (humidified) air. The theory is that moisture in the airways may be soothing and may help to clear secretions. Humidifiers are available from most large pharmacies but can be expensive. Alternatively, you can place hot water in a large bowl and then breathe in the steam. Pharmacies sell a variety of devices to do this in a more convenient way. The most simple is a steam cup, which is fitted with a lid and mask. You put the boiling water in a cup, put the lid on the top and breathe through the mask. Always be careful not to burn yourself with the hot water.

Rest your voice. If possible, rest your voice when you have laryngitis. If you overuse your voice when the vocal cords are inflamed, it may make the inflammation worse. It is unlikely to do any permanent damage but it may take longer for your normal voice to return. Resting the voice means not shouting, singing or talking for long periods. Quiet conversation is usually fine. A sighing soft speech is best rather than whispering until the laryngitis has gone. This is because whispering makes your voice box (larynx) work harder than soft sighing speech. Once you can hum comfortably, you can probably start talking normally again.

Singing and laryngitis
If you are a performer such as a singer, it can be a difficult decision as to when to start singing again. Singing too early, when symptoms are easing, may prolong the hoarse voice longer than if you rest it fully until symptoms have completely gone.
There is no easy answer as to the earliest it is safe to sing without doing any more harm. A professional singer may wish to consult a speech therapist if a crucial decision is to be made about an important singing engagement.
Laryngitis and antibiotics
Antibiotics are usually not needed for laryngitis. It is usually caused by a virus. Antibiotics do not kill viruses; they only kill bacteria. Your immune system usually clears viral infections quickly. A more severe laryngitis is sometimes due to bacterial infections.
An antibiotic may be advised if:
The infection is severe.

Frequently Asked Questions
Complications of laryngitis
Breathing difficulty is an uncommon complication with laryngitis. This may occur if there is a lot of inflammation and swelling in the voice box (larynx), which causes the windpipe (trachea) to narrow. This is rare in adults but sometimes happens in young children with smaller, narrower windpipes. See a doctor urgently if you have any difficulty in breathing with laryngitis.
How is laryngitis diagnosed?
Normally no tests are needed and the diagnosis can be made from your symptoms and from examining you. However, you will need further tests if your hoarse voice lasts for more than three weeks.
Sometimes your doctor may decide to take a culture to confirm which type of infection is causing your laryngitis. Your doctor will use a flat stick (tongue depressor) to press down your tongue and then rub a clean cotton swab over the back of your throat. This is sent for laboratory analysis to check for infection. The results usually takes a few days to come back.
This is a test that looks closely at the larynx with a laryngoscope. A laryngoscope is a thin metal tube with a light on the end. It is passed through your nose and into your throat so that the doctor can take a good look at your larynx. A local anaesthetic spray is usually used before the procedure, to numb the area.
If your doctor wants to take a sample (biopsy) of your larynx this is done under general anaesthetic (you will be asleep). The biopsy is a small piece of tissue from your larynx that is removed so that it can be examined under a microscope. This test is used to check for cancer of the larynx and tuberculosis.
When should I contact a doctor about laryngitis?
Contact a doctor if any of the following develop:
Symptoms that are severe or are different from those described above.

Hoarseness or loss of your voice when you have had a recent operation to your neck.
Hoarseness or loss of your voice when you have had a recent operation to your neck.
If the hoarseness in your voice does not settle in three weeks, you should always see your doctor
You will be referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist who can look down past your throat with a special instrument called a laryngoscope. This is so they can look directly at the voice box (larynx) to find the cause of the laryngitis.
Once the cause has been found, treatment can be advised. For example, if laryngitis is due to voice overuse, you may be referred to a speech therapist for exercises for your larynx. Or if it is due to acid reflux, you may need treatment for that.
Laryngoscopy also checks your hoarseness is not caused by anything more serious.
Non-cancerous (benign) lumps or nodules on vocal cords.

Should you stay home with laryngitis?
If you have laryngitis and no other symptoms, you are usually able to continue with your normal activities including going to work. If your job requires you to use your voice (eg, teaching or performing) you may want to take a few days off work to allow your voice to recover.

What is glandular fever?
Glandular fever is a viral infection, mostly caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. The virus can be passed from person to person by close contact.
Glandular fever is known as infectious mononucleosis in the US and some other countries. This is because the infection often causes an increase in a particular white blood cell called a monocyte. It is sometimes known as "mono".
It can take up to seven weeks for the symptoms to develop after a person has first been infected with this virus. This is called the incubation period.
What are the symptoms of glandular fever?
Some people will have the glandular fever infection without knowing that they have it, or have mild symptoms that they assume is a normal cold.
One or more of the following symptoms commonly occur for about a week or so. Symptoms then usually gradually settle over another week.
Sore throat
The throat is often very sore, red and swollen. Tonsils may be enlarged and covered in pus. Glandular fever may be suspected if tonsillitis is severe and lasts longer than usual. Swallowing is often painful and saliva may pool in the mouth.
NB Tonsils being covered in pus does not mean this is a bacterial infection needing antibiotics. Pus is also caused by viral infections, such as glandular fever. Antibiotics are not usually necessary and can make symptoms worse.
Swollen glands
As the body's immune system fights off the virus, it causes swollen lymph nodes (glands). Any lymph gland in the body can be affected but the glands in the neck are usually the most prominent. They can become quite large and tender.
Flu-like symptoms
Like other viral infections, glandular fever often causes a high temperature (fever), muscle aches and headaches.
Malaise
A feeling of intense tiredness quite often develops with glandular fever.
Eye symptoms
A variety of symptoms of inflammation of the eyes, including conjunctivitis, can sometimes occur with glandular fever.
Enlarged spleen
The spleen is an organ under the ribs on the left side of the abdomen. It is part of the immune system. Like the lymph glands, it swells and can sometimes be felt below the ribs in people with glandular fever. Very occasionally, it causes mild pain in the upper left abdomen.
No symptoms
Many people become infected with this virus but do not develop symptoms. This is called a subclinical infection. This is more common in children.
What causes glandular fever?
Glandular fever is most often caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). In about 1 in 10 people with glandular fever, it is caused by a different virus, such as cytomegalovirus, adenovirus or human herpesvirus 6.
The virus infects the cells on the lining of the throat. The infection is then passed into the white blood cells before spreading through the lymphatic system. This is a series of glands (nodes) found throughout the body. The lymphatic system also includes certain organs such as the spleen.
Is glandular fever contagious?
Glandular fever is not particularly contagious. It is mainly spread through contact with saliva, eg, kissing, sharing cups, food and drinks, toothbrushes or cutlery.
Small children may be infected by chewing toys that have been contaminated with the virus. It can also be spread through sexual contact, blood transfusion and organ transplant.
The disease is contagious during the incubation period and while symptoms are present. Some people may remain contagious for up to 18 months after they have had the infection.
Who gets glandular fever?
Glandular fever can affect people of any age but is most commonly affects teenagers and young adults. The immune system makes antibodies during the infection. This then usually provides lifelong immunity for those who develop glandular fever. This means that it is rare to have more than one episode of glandular fever.
It is estimated that 95 out of 100 adults in the world have immunity to glandular fever. This means that they have had glandular fever in the past, even though many of them were unaware of it.
In the US, white teenagers are more than 30 times more likely than Black teenagers to develop symptoms of glandular fever. It is thought that glandular fever is more common in Black children who are therefore immune by the time they are teenagers.
How is glandular fever diagnosed?
The symptoms caused by glandular fever are similar to symptoms due to various other viruses. Therefore, it can be difficult to diagnose glandular fever just by being examined.
A blood test may therefore be done that can detect an antibody to the Epstein-Barr virus and confirm a glandular fever infection.
What are the complications of glandular fever?
Most people with glandular fever do not have any complications or rare symptoms. If complications do occur, they may include:
Damaged spleen
This is a serious complication of glandular fever but rare, occurring in about 1 in 100 cases. As described above, the spleen is an organ that sits in the upper left side of the abdomen, usually protected by the lower ribs. A swollen spleen is more delicate than normal and may protrude below the ribs.
The spleen normally reduces to its normal size after about three weeks. However, one study found that in 3 out of 19 people it took eight weeks.
A damaged spleen may occur if the left side of the chest or abdomen is injured. It is therefore usually advised to avoid contact sports, such as rugby, for eight weeks after having glandular fever.
Rash
A widespread, non-itchy red rash occurs in some people with glandular fever. This usually fades quickly. The rash can also be caused by giving antibiotics. Antibiotics are not useful in glandular fever as it is caused by a virus not by a bacteria.
Viral hepatitis
The Epstein-Barr virus commonly causes mild inflammation of the liver (acute viral hepatitis) which gets better by itself and often has no symptoms. About 1 in 20 people develop yellowing of the skin (mild jaundice). This also goes away without treatment in the vast majority of cases.
Malaise and depression
It is common to feel tired and low for the duration of the illness and for a week or so afterwards. About 1 in 10 people develop 'postviral fatigue' which can last longer and occasionally for several months.
How is glandular fever treated?
There is no cure for glandular fever and no specific treatment is needed, as the immune system deals with the infection by itself. However:
Drink plenty of fluids
It is important to drink plenty of fluids. It is often tempting not to drink very much if it is painful to swallow. This can lead to mild lack of fluid in the body (dehydration), particularly if you also have a high temperature (fever).
Mild dehydration can make headaches and tiredness much worse. It can be worthwhile taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease pain, headache and fever.
Steroid medicines
Some studies have looked at the use of steroid medicines for people with glandular fever. The theory was that steroids help to reduce inflammation in various conditions and so may do so for glandular fever. However, the current advice is that steroids are more likely to suppress the immune system so should not be used.
Avoid contact
To prevent spread, it is important to avoid kissing and close body contact with other people to stop glandular fever spreading. It is also best not to share cups, towels, etc, whilst ill.
There is no need to miss any school with glandular fever, unless feeling too unwell to attend. Medical advice should be sought if any unusual, severe or unexplained symptoms develop.
Reduce alcohol intake
Glandular fever can cause a temporary inflammation of the liver. This means that drinking alcohol whilst having glandular fever can cause people to feel very unwell. It is therefore advised to avoid alcohol completely during glandular fever.
Are antibiotics needed?
Antibiotic medicines are not used, as glandular fever is caused by a virus. Antibiotics do not kill viruses.
How long does glandular fever last?
A full recovery is usual within a couple of weeks. Some people have a lingering tiredness that lasts a few weeks. It is rare to have glandular fever a second time.

Outer ear infection (otitis externa)
Fungal ear infection
Boil in the ear canal
Barotrauma to the ear
Earache, or pain in the ear, is very common. It is particularly common in children. There are many causes of earache but the most common cause is infection. This often clears up on its own without any treatment. However, if it is not getting better or if there are other more serious symptoms, clinical help might be needed
The ear is involved in hearing and balance. So, problems with the ear may cause other symptoms such as loss of hearing, dizziness or a ringing in the ear.
This leaflet provides an overview of some of the more common problems related to the ears. It will direct you towards leaflets with more detailed information on the individual conditions.

Middle ear infection (otitis media)
Otitis media is an extremely common cause of earache in children. It can occur in adults, but is unusual.
It is most common in children of preschool age. It often occurs following a common cold. Children with otitis media have a painful ear (due to pressure in the middle ear) and often a high temperature (fever).
Treatment
Mostly otitis media gets better on its own and should be treated with painkillers only for at least 48 hours before seeking medical help. However, if it is not improving after a few days or if a child is under two years old, a doctor may consider antibiotic medication.
For more details about otitis media, see the separate leaflet called Ear Infection (Otitis Media).
Infection in the ear canal (otitis externa)
Otitis externa is an infection of the outer part of the ear, the ear canal. This type of infection is more common in:
Adults than in children.
Adults than in children.
People who swim.
People who swim.
People who have skin conditions around the ear (such as eczema).
People who have skin conditions around the ear (such as eczema).
In otitis externa, the ear may feel sore or itchy. There may be a discharge coming out of the ear. The ear may feel blocked and it may be difficult to hear as well as usual.
Treatment
The treatment for otitis externa is usually ear drops or an ear spray which will usually need to be prescribed. However, there are ear drops called acetic acid ear drops (EarCalm®) available over the counter which can treat most mild cases of otitis externa.
Acetic acid drops make the inside of the ear more acidic. This has antifungal and antibacterial effects but for more severe infections an anti-infective medicine such as antibiotic ear drops may be needed.
See the separate leaflets called Ear Infection (Otitis Externa) and Fungal Ear Infection for more detailed information.
Wax
Ears produce a waxy substance to protect the ear canals. Normally this naturally moves out of the ear on its own. However, sometimes a plug of wax can form, blocking the ear canal. This may cause hearing reduction on one or both sides and can be uncomfortable.
There may also be popping sounds or a ringing in the ear when there is wax stuck in the ear. Occasionally it can cause a dizziness feeling.
Treatment
It is important never to try to remove earwax with cotton swabs. This can push the wax further into the canal and cause a blockage.
Wax can be removed with oils or ear drops to help prevent earache. Warmed olive oil or sodium bicarbonate ear drops (available from a pharmacy) applied three times a day usually help within a few days.
If this does not remove the wax, you may need to seek further help. Ear irrigation (flushing the ear canal out with warm water) is usually no longer recommended and most surgeries no longer offer this. Microsuction is the best treatment nowadays (sucking the wax from the ear canal). This is not always available on the NHS (dependent on area) and might need to be accessed privately.
For further information, see the separate leaflet called Earwax.
A common cold
Sometimes a common cold can cause earache without there being an infection in the ear itself. This is due to the excessive mucus produced during a cold. Some of this may collect and cause pressure in the middle ear and on the eardrum, causing earache. This will normally improve on its own.
Treatment
Steam inhalation.

Why do I get earache after I've had a cold?
Foreign bodies
All sorts of objects can get stuck in ears. This is particularly common in children but can also occur in adults. Foreign bodies which can get into ears include beads, seeds, toys, bits of cotton bud and insects.
Putting objects in the ear may cause earache, deafness, or a discharge. It may be possible to see the foreign body in the ear canal.
Treatment
A foreign body should not be removed at home unless it is very superficial as it may be pushed deeper into the ear canal causing potential damage to the eardrum. An urgent care centre or emergency department will usually be able to remove it. Foreign bodies can usually be removed with forceps or by flushing them out with water (irrigation).
Trauma or injury
Poking things into the ear, such as cotton buds or sharp objects, can cause damage to the ear canal. This can cause soreness which usually goes away on its own. It may go on to become infected, however. So if the pain does not settle, or if a discharge develops, medical advice should be sought.
To avoid damage nothing should be poked in the ear, even if it itches or feels blocked.
The eardrum can be torn (perforated) by objects poked into the ear. This can also happen due to other injuries such as a very loud noise or a slapped or boxed ear. Other more serious head injuries can also cause damage to the eardrum.
A perforated eardrum usually causes a very sudden and severe pain. There may be some bleeding from the ear as well as hearing loss.
A perforated eardrum usually heals up on its own very well. However, if the pain or other symptoms do not settle after a couple of weeks, medical advice should be sought
See the separate leaflet called Perforated Eardrum for more information.
Flying and diving
The changes in pressure as a plane starts to descend commonly cause pain in the ear. This usually settles quickly. Similar problems can happen when scuba diving or even when going down in a lift. Chewing gum or sucking sweets can sometimes help to reduce this change in pressure. Swallowing or yawning can also help; the valsalva manoeuvre can be used - to do this, block the nostrils by pinching the nose and close the mouth and then blow gently. Babies should be encouraged to suckle during ascent/descent on a plane - this is easiest with a dummy.
For more information, and tips about how to improve this type of earache, see the separate leaflets called Ears and Flying and Barotrauma of the Ear.
How can I avoid earache when I fly or dive?
Boils, spots and pimples
Boils, spots and pimples can occur on the ear just like anywhere else on your body. If they are on the outside of the ear, they will be visible but if they are in the ear canal it may not be possible to see where the pain is coming from.
Treatment
A small spot or boil will usually improve on its own with warm bathing. However, if it is very large or red or painful, it may need an antibiotic medicine, or lancing with a needle.
See the separate leaflet called Boil in the Ear Canal for more information.
Pain coming from somewhere else (referred pain)
Referred pain is pain felt in one part of the body from a problem elsewhere in the body. Sometimes a pain in the ear is nothing to do with the ear but is coming from somewhere else. Causes of referred pain in the ear include:
Problems with teeth, such as teething in children, an emerging wisdom tooth or dental abscesses.

Shingles
Shingles is a condition where the virus which causes chickenpox (the varicella-zoster virus) is reactivated in just one nerve. It causes pain and a rash in the area of skin which that nerve supplies. Occasionally shingles can affect the nerve which supplies the ear. Symptoms may include:
Pain inside the ear or on the outer ear, or both.

If shingles around the ear is suspected, then medical attention should be sought as soon as possible. If treatment is required, it works best if it is started early. However, not all cases of shingles need treatment.
See the separate leaflet called Shingles (Herpes Zoster) for more information.
How to help an earache
An earache should be treated yourself with simple painkillers. Paracetamol or ibuprofen usually works well for ear pain. However, a person with earache should see a doctor if:
They are unwell with other symptoms such as a high temperature (fever), a rash, being sick (vomiting), confusion or drowsiness.

Structure and functions of the ear
Cross-section of the ear
The ear is roughly divided into three parts.
The outer (external) ear includes:
The part you can see, called the pinna.

A narrow tube-like structure - the ear canal.

The eardrum which is at the end of the canal. This separates the external ear from the middle ear. The eardrum is a tightly stretched membrane, a bit like the skin of a drum.

The middle ear is an air-filled compartment. Inside it are three of the smallest bones in the body, called malleus, incus and stapes. These bones are connected to each other. The last in the group, stapes, also makes contact with the internal (inner) ear. The air space of the middle ear connects to the back of the nose by the Eustachian tube.
The inner ear is made up of two components:
The cochlea - a snail-shaped chamber filled with fluid. It is lined with special hair cells. These cells transform sound waves into electrical signals. These signals are then passed by nerves to the brain.

Ear, nose and throat
We all get earache from time to time, and while it's no fun, this common problem is usually minor, often clearing without the need for treatment over a few days. But a painful ear can be very uncomfortable, and there are earache relief methods you can use at home that also speed along recovery. We outline the medicines and home remedies to help some of the most common earache problems - and when you need to see a doctor.

Other ear problems
Discharge from the ear
A number of different conditions can cause discharge from the ear. Many of these are discussed in the sections above. The more common ones include:
A burst (perforated) eardrum. This is discussed above in the trauma and injury section. Another common cause of a perforated eardrum is otitis media, also discussed above. In this condition the inflamed eardrum becomes so stretched that it bursts. The infected pus (mucus) in the middle ear then leaks out along the ear canal and can be seen. Typically, when this happens, a child has had an earache for a few days and then it suddenly becomes a lot better as the discharge (pus) becomes visible. This is because the eardrum is not being stretched so tightly anymore. An eardrum burst in this way usually heals up very well. However, antibiotics may be prescribed for the infection.

This is discussed in full in a separate leaflet called Glue Ear. It is a condition where the middle ear fills up with a glue-like fluid instead of air. It usually occurs in children who have had a number of middle ear infections. It causes dulled hearing. Occasionally it can cause earache.
Tinnitus
Tinnitus is a ringing or buzzing noise heard inside the ear. It is discussed in full in a separate leaflet called Tinnitus. The most common cause for this is age-related changes in the ear. This occurs commonly along with age-related hearing loss. Sometimes it is caused by another condition, such as Ménière's disease, noise damage or ear infections.
Hearing loss (deafness)
Many of the conditions discussed elsewhere in this leaflet can cause hearing loss. One of the main functions of your ear is to allow hearing. Therefore almost anything that goes wrong with it can affect hearing. Depending on the condition this can be temporary or permanent, treatable or not.
If the hearing loss comes on suddenly with earache and/or discharge, it is most likely to be due to an infection. If it comes on gradually with age, it is more likely to be due to age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Wax is a common, easily treated cause of hearing loss. In children, glue ear is a common cause of hearing loss.
Hearing loss due to infection or wax can be treated as discussed above. In permanent hearing loss, even if it can't be treated (for example, age-related hearing loss), hearing aids can be used which an make an enormous difference to quality of life.
See the separate leaflets called Hearing Problems and Hearing Tests for more information.
