ive been having eptopic beats for 3 years on and off. had tests but clear. Doc just says “its fine, everyone gets them but its just that you can feel them”, not helpful at all. Anyone have suggestions to stop worrying? Thanks x

My cardiologist explained to me that if rate of PVCs is >10% of all heart beats, then that is excessive and must be treated. So maybe check you pulse at different times of the day, and each time, count how many PVCs you get for every 100 beats. Alternatively, ask your doc to let you where a holter monitor to get more reliable statistics, or else one of those watches that measure heart rhythm. I once wore a 24 hour holter monitor which reported an ectopic burden of 13% of all my beats, so was definitely in the red zone. However, I was not displaying any symptoms and the echocardiogram did not reveal any structural or functional issues apart from minor regurgitation. Based on that, my arrhythmia was deemed benign, however I was told that my excessive rate of PVCs could lead to heart damage in the long run if left untreated. We estabished that it wasnt caused by alchohol or caffeine, so I was given the choice of medication or ablation, and I opted with meds as a first measure. I was initially prescribed Beta Blockers but they did not work, so I moved on to Flecainide which has improved my condition significantly. I still get PVCs but much much less than I used to. So I’ll be keeping an eye on it. Anyway, best of luck
