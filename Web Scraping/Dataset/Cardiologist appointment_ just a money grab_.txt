Hi, My doctor wanted my blood pressure checked over a 24 hour period so I went and had a blood pressure monitor fitted for 24 hours. The results will be sent to my doctor by Friday next week. When I asked for a copy of the read outs I was told they cannot give them to me. When I dropped the monitor of this morning they told me that they have arranged a phone appointment with a cardiologist. My doctor did not request this and just wanted my BP monitored for 24 hours. Is it normal to see the cardiologist? $350 for a phone consult, Medicare will re-imburse $150.
What should I do?
