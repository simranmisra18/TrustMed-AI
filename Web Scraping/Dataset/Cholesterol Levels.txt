I am a little confused by my cholesterol results and my Dr is saying I should not be worried. But I have high Cholesterol.
So I am 40 year old male and have BMI 22 exercise a few times a week and eat a healthy diet apart from to much Chocolate.
My cholesterol ratio was 3.8
and my HDL level 2.1
my serum cholestrol level was 7.9
and serum non high density level was 5.8
serum LDL c level ws 5.3
Although my bad chol level is high the dr did not seem concerned as the ratio was good, is this right. She just batted my concern away and said not to worry.
I should also add I have raised liver function (only slight) which is being investigated with an ultra sound
