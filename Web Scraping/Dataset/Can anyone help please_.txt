ive been suffering with what i think is ectopic beats i can have a pause then a thud, a pause then 2 thuds, 2 thuds then a pause sometimes multiple thuds and ive also felt a double beat. ive had 24hr ecg which didnt pick anything up other than sometimes a fast heartrate and also an echocardiogram which was normal, I’m waiting for a 7 day ecg but in the meantime I was wondering if anyone has anything like this or anything similar I’m scared it’s not ectopic beats and that it could be VT with the multiple thuds. any advice or help would be really appreciated. Thank you in advance
