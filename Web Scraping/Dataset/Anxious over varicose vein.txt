Hi,
I am a 38 year old male. Always been sporty and regularly exercise. No known health issues.
For the past few years i have noticed a growing varicose vein that started as a squidgy bulge in my inner thigh. It has now grown in size into a congestion of bulging veins and i can feel it run down my inner leg pretty much down to by foot. No pain but my leg just generally feels a bit full and pressure.
I have now noticed that when i cough or tense my stomach muscles i can see the bulging vein within my inner thigh swell and feel with my hand blood flushing through it. when i stop coughing or tensing it goes back down. Whats going on here?
Im trying to get my GP to refer me to a vein specialist but im only getting video appointments and told the NHS dont do varicose veins. But the bulging when i cough and the blood flowing feeling in my thigh and groin is making me feel a bit uncomfortable.
any ideas if this is normal for varicose veins in one leg?
thanks
