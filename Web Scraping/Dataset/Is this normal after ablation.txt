Hello Everyone, I’m here again, i had my ablation on January 3rd and i had some chest tightness for a while, but 2 weeks and a half ago i started to feel my arm and my shoulder aching (sometimes my jaw) and i’m having some ectopic beats (i know this is normal), but despite my arm, shoulder and jaw pain, that worsens with effort sometimes i feel my armpit a little itchy.
I just want to know if this is part of recovery.
PS: I work carrying bags and heavy objects in a hotel, so my job is purely physical effort, and i came back on January 17th (14 days after my ablation).
