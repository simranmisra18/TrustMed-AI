Hi All, I am a 26yo female with no history of health conditions. Recently I’ve been experiencing some chest/heart related symptoms and all medical tests so far have not found the cause.
I’m wondering if anyone has any ideas of the cause of the following symptoms:
Heart palpatations
Chest tightness - feeling of chest being crushed and a vibrating feeling (flares up each day at different times, no obvious pattern, not necessarily triggered by physical exertion). Note - no pain when I press on my chest.
Hot sweats
Shaky hands/hypertension
Resulting anxiety worrying about what is wrong with my heart.
Thyroid issues ruled out. Blood tests fine. Chest Xray clear. Awaiting an Echocardiogram.
Thanks
