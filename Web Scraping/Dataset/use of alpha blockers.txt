I have high BP and have taken Atenolol for over 20 years. My Gp had now added in a small dose of Doxazosin which is causing problems. I had a labyrinthectomy in 1999 and also have a lazy eye. With only half my balance mechanism and only half my focused vision my balance is always compromised but with years of VRT I lead a fairly normal life. However the alpha blocker has caused my vestibular system to decompensate. My GP doesn't understand. Am I right to stop taking it?

My BP had crept up and my GP added a low dose of Doxazosin. After about half a day I started feeling dizzy, it was just a bit of light-headedness at first so I persevered. A week later I had to stop it, I felt dreadful. I didn’t dare drive because my head was spinning, it was horrible. I was scared of falling all the time and it didn’t have much effect on my BP. I’m taking Moxonidine now with no side effects bar a slightly dry mouth. I hope you get sorted out OK.
