Anyone switched from Amlodipine to Lercandipine or any other pine? My dose of amlodipine was upped to 10mg but side effects kicked in so need to switch to another CCB. Any thoughts or experiences good or bad?

I would be very interested to know this too. I’ve recently been prescribed a low dose (2.5mg) slow release felodipine and it’s working well on my BP but it’s making my legs ache and swell. I have read about these two newer pines and how they’re supposed to have fewer side effects

Hello,
I’ve recently started on Amlodipine 5mg but having awful palpitations, flushing, anxiety. Have you tried any alternatives that work?
