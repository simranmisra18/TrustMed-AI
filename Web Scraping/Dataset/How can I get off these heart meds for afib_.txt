I have had the cardioaversion, and ablation procedures done late this summer of 2022. The afib is gone! My heart resting rate is in the 50's. its been over 3 months now. I cannot stand that i am still on so many drugs! I don't feel like anyone is there to help me get off! Do I need to take elliquis, entresto, amiodarone, metoprolol, spironlactone forever now? Every drug has a side effect. (we all know this!) So this cannot be a good plan. I need a doctor who will help me get off these drugs safely. help!

You need advice from a cardiologist. Nobody on here would be qualified I don’t think. Good luck.
