I am 67 male from south East Asia. I take medicines to keep my BP and cholesterol under control as well as a blood thinner tablet .My BP and cholesterol is under control except that HDL is 27 which should be around 40 . I avoid fat and sugar in my food ,however yet to start my daily walk ,due to busy office routine. My cardiac gated CT scan has shown calcium score of 1845 . I was regularly taking Vitamin D supplement which I have stopped now . I have no chest pain or any other symptoms relating to heart ailment .My doctor has now advised me to go for a tc 99 Myocardial Perfusion scan . I am confused .Should I go for this scan as I have no apparent indications other than the high calcium score and lower HDL ? Any advice from the Group . SLA
