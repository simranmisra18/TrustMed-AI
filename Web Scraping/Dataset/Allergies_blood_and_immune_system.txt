Hay fever is caused by an allergy to pollen. Common hay fever symptoms are a runny, itchy and/or blocked nose, sneezing and itchy eyes. Common treatments are an antihistamine nasal spray or medicine and/or a steroid nasal spray. Other treatments are sometimes used if these common treatments do not work so well.

What is hay fever?
Hay fever is an allergy to grass or hay pollens. Pollen is the name given to the fine powder that is produced by plants, trees or flowers to fertilise other plants, trees or flowers of the same species.
Grass pollen is the most common cause and tends to affect people every year in the grass pollen season from about May to July (late spring to early summer). However, the term is often used when allergies are caused by other pollens such as tree pollens.
Tree pollens tend to affect people from March to May (early to late spring) each year. Other people may be allergic to weed pollens (including nettles and docks). Weeds tend to pollinate from early spring to early autumn.
In medical terms, hay fever causes a condition called seasonal allergic rhinitis. This means inflammation of the nose (rhinitis), that occurs due to an allergy (allergic), occurring usually at the same time, or in the same season, each year (seasonal). It can also cause allergic inflammation of the outer part of the eyes (allergic conjunctivitis).

Allergies, blood and immune system
Medicines can cause allergic reactions. In this leaflet these reactions are called 'drug allergies'. In this instance the drugs referred to are medicines people take for their health. For example, antibiotics or anti-inflammatory painkillers rather than drugs of addiction. Allergic reactions can happen with prescribed medicines as well as those you have bought from a pharmacy. Drug allergies may be mild, moderate or severe. Some can come on in a matter of minutes. Others may take days or even weeks to develop. Some reactions are so severe they can be life-threatening. Mild reactions can sometimes be treated simply by stopping the medicine. Severe reactions usually require hospital admission.
by Dr Hayley Willacy, FRCGP
Hay fever symptoms
The symptoms of hay fever are due to your immune system reacting to pollen. Cells on the lining of the nose and eyes release chemicals (for example, histamine) when they come into contact with pollen. This causes inflammation in the nose (rhinitis) and eyes (conjunctivitis). Sometimes the sinuses and throat can also be affected.
Despite the name, hay fever does not cause a fever (high temperature). A high temperature (higher than 38°C) is usually caused by an infection instead.
The symptoms of hay fever can vary from person to person. Some people only have mild symptoms that tend to come and go. Others can be severely affected with symptoms that are present every day during the pollen season:

Asthma symptoms
Some people develop asthma symptoms such as wheeze and breathlessness. People who already have asthma may get worsening symptoms. Some people have asthma symptoms only during the hay fever season. If you have hay fever, you are more likely to develop asthma.
The symptoms may be so bad in some people that they can affect sleep. They may interfere with school and examinations, or interfere with work.
Hay fever and other seasonal allergies may also be associated with
oral allergy syndrome
How long does hay fever last?
Hay fever symptoms usually last for the length of the pollen season. For example, people allergic to grass pollen may get symptoms from May to July, and people with tree pollen allergies can experience symptoms from March to May. Some people are allergic to more than one type of pollen, and experience symptoms for longer.
Pollen levels change depending on the weather, geographical location, and many other things, and so symptoms can flare up and improve at different points during the season.
Many people find that their hay fever symptoms get better as they get older. A study of American college students found that, amongst people who had hay fever in their first year at university, over half found that their hay fever symptoms had improved 23 years later. About 20% of them had no hay fever symptoms at all.
Like other allergies, some people seem to grow out of hay fever. We don't really know why this happens in some people, and not others.
Some people have perennial allergic rhinitis, which means they have allergic symptoms throughout the entire year. This is usually due to allergies to things like dust mites, or cat and dog fur. However, they might also be allergic to pollen as well, meaning that their symptoms get worse during hay fever season.
How common is hay fever?
Hay fever is very common. Estimates vary; some say it affects about 1 in 5 people in the UK, but others suggest it may affect up to half of all people.
Hay fever - like other allergies - is becoming more common in the UK and other countries. We don't fully know why this is happening.
Hay fever usually starts in children and teenagers, and often gets better with age. However, some people continue to get symptoms throughout their life. It can also develop for the first time in adulthood.
Is hay fever genetic?
The reasons why people develop hay fever are very complicated, and not fully understood. We think it's a combination of things in the environment, like exposure to potential allergens, and genetics.
Hay fever tends to run in families. People with hay fever are also more likely to have asthma and eczema. Asthma, eczema, and hay fever together are known as atopic conditions; these conditions probably have similar underlying causes.
Researchers have found several different genes which are linked with an increased risk of hay fever and other atopic conditions.
It's likely that some people inherit a set of genes which make them more likely to develop hay fever, but that something else needs to happen (an environmental trigger) too for them to develop the condition.
How do I know if I have hay fever?
Hay fever can usually be diagnosed if you have any of the typical symptoms that occur during the hay fever season. You don’t always need to see a doctor if you think you have hay fever. It is more common if you have a history of asthma or eczema.
A pharmacist can suggest treatments to improve hay fever symptoms. All of the initial treatments for hay fever (antihistamine tablets, nasal sprays, and eye drops) are available from a pharmacy without prescription in the UK.
If you're not sure if you have hay fever, or if these treatments haven't worked, speak to a doctor.
A doctor should be able to tell you if your symptoms are due to hay fever, or something else.
Allergy tests usually aren't needed if the cause of the allergy (pollen) is clear. They might be useful if it isn't obvious, or if other allergies, such as dust mite allergies, are suspected.
See the separate leaflet called Skin Prick Allergy Test for more details.
Very occasionally, other tests may be needed. Scans or tests to check the airflow through your nostrils may be rarely used to rule out other causes of the symptoms.
How to help hay fever
Unfortunately, it is impossible to avoid pollen totally. However, symptoms tend to be less severe if you reduce your exposure to pollen. The pollen count is the number of pollen grains per cubic metre of air. The pollen count is often given with TV, radio, internet, or newspaper weather forecasts. A high pollen count is a count above 50.
You can check the current pollen forecast here. The following may help when the pollen count is high:
Stay indoors as much as possible and keep windows and doors shut.

Hay fever treatment
For advice in pregnancy, see the "Treating hay fever in pregnancy" section below.
Although there is no cure for hay fever, the commonly used hay fever treatment options are:
Antihistamine tablets.
Antihistamine tablets.
Steroid nasal sprays.
Steroid nasal sprays.
Antihistamine nasal sprays.
Antihistamine nasal sprays.
Eye drops.
Eye drops.
If your hay fever symptoms are not controlled on the medication that you are taking after 2-4 weeks, you should discuss this with your doctor. You may need to try a different treatment or add in another treatment.
If you are taking hay fever medication regularly and your hay fever is well controlled on your current treatment, you should continue this treatment until the end of the pollen season.
If you're a regular hay fever sufferer, treatments such as antihistamine tablets work best if you start taking them before symptoms start. Try to start taking antihistamine tablets 2-4 weeks before pollen season starts; you can continue taking them throughout the season.
Antihistamine nasal spray
A dose from an antihistamine nasal spray can rapidly ease itching, sneezing and watering (within 15 minutes or so). It may not be so good at easing congestion. Antihistamines work by blocking the action of histamine. This is one of the chemicals involved in allergic reactions. A spray can be used as required if you have mild symptoms. It can also be taken regularly to keep symptoms away.
Antihistamine tablets (or liquid medicines)
Antihistamines taken by mouth (tablets or liquids) are an alternative. They ease most of the symptoms but may not be so good at relieving a blocked nose (nasal congestion).
Antihistamines taken by mouth are good if you have eye symptoms as well as nasal symptoms. They are also usually given to small children instead of a nasal spray. A dose usually works within an hour. Therefore, one can be taken as required if symptoms come and go. One can also be taken regularly if symptoms occur each day.
There are several types and brands of antihistamines that you can buy at pharmacies or get on prescription. Older antihistamines, such as chlorphenamine, work well but make some people drowsy. So, they should not be taken if you are driving or operating machinery. Non-drowsy histamines are a better first choice, as they are less likely to cause drowsiness.
Commonly used non-drowsy antihistamines include:
Loratadine.
Loratadine.
Cetirizine.
Cetirizine.
Fexofenadine.
Fexofenadine.
Acrivastine.
Acrivastine.
All of these are available without prescription. Until 2020, fexofenadine was prescription only, but fexofenadine 120mg tablets can now be bought without prescription.
Antihistamine medicines such as loratadine and cetirizine may be used by children from the age of 2 years.
Steroid nasal sprays and drops
A steroid nasal spray usually works well to clear all the nasal symptoms (itch, sneezing, watering and congestion). It works by reducing inflammation in the nose. A steroid nasal spray also tends to ease eye symptoms. It is not clear how it helps the eye symptoms - but it often does. Steroid nasal drops are also sometimes used.
It takes several days for a steroid spray to build up its full effect. Therefore, there is no immediate relief of symptoms when you first start it. In some people it can take up to three weeks or longer to be fully effective. So do persevere. (It is best to start taking it a few weeks before the hay fever season is likely to begin if you know that you have hay fever.)
A steroid nasal spray tends to be the most effective treatment when symptoms are more severe. It can also be used by adults in addition to antihistamines if symptoms are not fully controlled by either alone.
You need to use the spray each day over the hay fever season to keep symptoms away. However, once symptoms have gone, the dose of a steroid spray can often be reduced to a low maintenance dose each day to keep symptoms away.
There are several brands which you can buy at pharmacies, or obtain on prescription. Side-effects or problems with steroid nasal sprays are rare (read the packet leaflet for details).
Commonly used steroid nasal sprays and drops include:
Mometasone.

Fluticasone.

Other hay fever remedies/treatment options
Eye drops
If necessary, you can use eye drops in addition to other treatments:
Mast cell stabiliser eye drops. These drops are thought to work by stopping the release of histamine from certain cells called mast cells. You need to use them regularly to prevent symptoms. They can be used throughout the hay fever season if you need to. There are several different ones. Commonly used ones include sodium cromoglicate, nedocromil and lodoxamide.

Antihistamine eye drops work quickly, so you can use them as required to ease a flare-up of eye symptoms. You can also use them regularly if needed. It is best not to use them for more than six weeks at a time, however. There are several different ones, including antazoline, azelastine and epinastine.

Other nasal sprays
The following are sometimes used. They tend to be used if there are problems with any of the above treatments. Sometimes one is used as an add-on treatment in addition to one or more of the above treatments if symptoms are not fully controlled:
Sodium cromoglicate nasal spray. Like steroid sprays, it takes a while to build up its effect and needs to be taken regularly. It is thought to work by stopping the release of histamine from certain cells. One disadvantage is that it needs to be taken 4-5 times a day (steroid sprays are taken 1-2 times a day). This appears to be the safest medicine to use for hay fever in the first three months of pregnancy.

Ipratropium bromide nasal spray may be worth a try if you have a lot of watery discharge. It has no effect on sneezing or congestion.

Decongestant nasal sprays that you can buy at pharmacies are not usually advised for more than a few days. They have an immediate effect to clear a blocked nose. However, if you use one for more than 5-7 days, a rebound, more severe congestion of the nose often develops. One may be useful for a few days to clear a blocked nose when you first use a steroid nasal spray. The steroid can then get to the lining of the nose to work. Don't use decongestant nasal sprays for more than seven days. Don't use decongestant sprays or tablets if you are pregnant.

Leukotriene receptor antagonists
These medicines block the effect of chemicals called leukotrienes which trigger hay fever symptoms. They work well when taken with antihistamine tablets, especially in people who also have asthma. These are mostly prescribed by specialists. One example is montelukast.
Nasal saline washouts
This is done by some people. The aim is to wash pollen out of the nostrils. This can sometimes help to reduce the need for steroid nasal sprays. Washouts can be bought from a pharmacist and are comprised of a delivery system such as a squeezable plastic bottle containing salt water (saline) connected to a tube inserted into the nose.
You can also make your own nasal rinse solution, eg, by mixing 250mL of sterilised (boiled and then cooled) water with 0.5 tsp of salt and 0.5 tsp of bicarbonate of soda in a clean container.
More sophisticated devices with pumps to control the pressure of the liquid are also available. For most benefit, washouts should be on a daily basis.
Treatment for severe symptoms
In severe cases, a short course of steroid tablets is prescribed for a week or so. For example, students sitting examinations, who have severe symptoms which are not eased by other treatments, may benefit from a short course of steroids. Steroid tablets usually work well to reduce inflammation.
A short course is usually safe. However, you should not take steroid tablets for long periods to treat hay fever, as serious side-effects may develop. Repeated courses of steroid tablets can also have serious side-effects.
Immunotherapy (desensitisation)
This treatment is sometimes used, mainly in cases where symptoms are severe and not helped by other treatments. There are two methods:
Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT). This is done using a series of injections of the allergen (in this case pollen) into the tissue just under the skin (the subcutaneous tissue). The idea is that your immune system will become desensitised to the pollen. This means that the allergic response that your body mounts when it is exposed to the pollen in the future is reduced, so improving your symptoms.

This means that the allergic response that your body mounts when it is exposed to the pollen in the future is reduced, so improving your symptoms.
Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). This is similar to the above but the allergen (pollen) is placed under the tongue (that is, sublingually). Typically, the dose is one tablet a day, starting four months before the start of the pollen season and continued for up to three years.

Immunotherapy is normally supervised by a specialist after careful assessment. It is not suitable for everyone. For example, people with certain diseases, pregnant women and people taking certain medicines will not be able to have this treatment. Your doctor will advise if this treatment is suitable for you.
Note: immunotherapy is unlikely to cure hay fever totally but will often greatly reduce the severity of symptoms. The less severe symptoms will then tend to be much easier to control with standard treatments such as antihistamines and nasal sprays. Also, immunotherapy has been shown to give long-lasting benefit for some years after stopping treatment.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended that adults with severe allergic inflammation in the nose (rhinitis) or conjunctivitis caused by pollen from birch trees can be given treatment with a tablet containing birch pollen allergen extract (Betula verrucose). Treatment can be used if you have symptoms despite using symptom-relieving medicines, and also have a positive allergy test (skin prick test or specific immunoglobulin E blood test) for birch tree pollen.
Treating hay fever in pregnancy
Most drug manufacturers recommend caution before using hay fever medicine in pregnancy, because these medicines haven't been tested in pregnant women in clinical trials. However, some medicines have been used widely in pregnant women, outside of research studies, without any signs that they are harmful.
If hay fever symptoms in pregnancy are mild or otherwise manageable, then no treatment is required. There is no evidence that hay fever itself causes harm in pregnancy - the only reason to treat it is to improve symptoms.
There isn't a national guideline in the UK on how best to treat hay fever in pregnant women, even though it is a very common problem. The following recommendations are based on the UK Teratology Information Service's Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy information - see Further Reading for more.
Although we think certain drug treatments are probably safe in pregnancy, to minimise any risks, it's probably a good idea to start with non-drug treatments, then move on to drugs that are very unlikely to be absorbed and reach the baby, and finally to use tablets if none of these have worked.
This stepwise approach looks like this:
Start by trying to reduce or eliminate exposure to the allergen (eg, pollen).

Apply Vaseline® or another petroleum jelly or wax-based ointment around the nostrils. This can trap pollen and other allergens and stop them reaching the nose.

These don't involve taking any medicine and avoid any theoretical risks of medication in pregnancy.
If they don't work, further options include:
Nasal sprays, including nasal steroids, mast-cell stabilisers and intranasal antihistamines. It's thought that very little of the drug enters the body, and so there is very little or no exposure of the fetus to these medicines.
Avoid nasal or tablet/capsule decongestants in pregnancy. These work by shrinking blood vessels in the nose. There is a theoretical risk that they might reduce the blood supply to the placenta in pregnancy. This risk is probably very small, but best avoided.

All three of these medicines have been given to pregnant women before. Currently, we don't have evidence linking them to harm in pregnancy. Some research studies have specifically looked at women who used them in pregnancy, and found no signs of harm; however, more research is needed, as these studies were quite small and may not detect rare side-effects.
Talk to your doctor or midwife about hay fever treatment if you are pregnant and think you might need medications.
Hay fever and asthma
If you develop asthma symptoms during the hay fever season you may be prescribed an inhaler. If you already have asthma, your asthma may become worse in the hay fever season. You may need an increase in the dose of your usual inhalers (or other treatment that you take for asthma) during the hay fever season.

What is immunosuppression?
Immunosuppression, also known as immune suppression or immunocompromise, means the immune system isn't working as well as it normally would. This includes any or all of the defences that make up the immune system - particularly the white cells in the bloodstream, the spleen and the lymph nodes.
When this system is suppressed, ie not working as it should, it leaves people more vulnerable to infection.
Someone who is immunosuppressed is more likely to need antibiotics or hospital admission for a bacterial infection. Most people who are immunosuppressed can't have live vaccines and they may need to take special precautions when travelling.
Immunosuppressed people are also more vulnerable to certain skin cancers.
What is the immune system?
Millions of bacteria, viruses and other germs (microbes) surround all of us all of the time. Some are actively helpful - for instance, it would be impossible to digest food without 'friendly' gut bacteria which live in everyone's gastrointestinal tract. Most are harmless unless they get into part of the body they are not designed to be in - and it's the job of our immune system to stop that happening.
The immune system - the body's defence against disease-causing microbes (pathogens) - can be divided into:
Lines of first defence (skin, saliva, the mucous membrane lining the nose, acidic stomach juices, etc).

Allergies, blood and immune system
This leaflet gives a brief overview of the immune system and how it works. A person with a weak immune system might have difficulty fighting off infections. In autoimmune diseases the body is unable to tell what is its own and what is foreign, so it attacks itself. Autoimmune diseases can attack any part of the body - eg, type 1 diabetes (pancreas), multiple sclerosis (brain and nerves), systemic lupus erythematosus (skin and organs). These diseases are managed by the specialist who knows most about the system affected for that person - eg, multiple sclerosis is managed by a neurologist.

Allergies, blood and immune system
Swollen lymph glands (also called lymph nodes) are usually a sign that your body is fighting infection, but they can have other causes. Common areas for swollen glands include the neck, under the chin, in the armpits and in the groin. Swollen lymph glands caused by infection usually get better on their own within two weeks. In this leaflet we discuss what causes swollen glands, how to check if your glands are swollen, and what to do if you think you have swollen glands.

Which medicines cause immunosuppression?
Oral steroids are a common cause of immunosuppression and are used in numerous conditions. They are more likely to lower the immune defences when used at high doses for long periods of time.
Lower doses do not generally cause a significant problem. For an adult, a dose of 40 mg per day of prednisolone for more than a week may cause immunosuppression, but this dose varies for other steroids and for children. See the separate leaflet called Oral Steroids for more information.
Other medicines which suppress the immune system include:
Azathioprine.

Symptoms of immunosuppression
Most immunosuppressed people have no symptoms. They may be prone to getting infections more frequently, and those infections may be more severe and severe complications may develop more frequently.
Immunosuppressed people are more likely to develop unusual or uncommon infections. For example, healthy adults do not usually get thrush in the oesophagus. For people with AIDS, however, thrush is common and may be very widespread or severe.
Complications of immunosuppression
Infections can develop and spread particularly quickly in people whose immune systems are suppressed. People are more likely to get spread of any infection to the whole body (sepsis), which can make them dangerously ill.
People who have immunosuppression also seem to be at higher risk of certain types of skin cancer. This includes:
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
Melanoma.
Melanoma.
Kaposi's sarcoma.
Kaposi's sarcoma.
It is not entirely known for sure why this is. It may be because the immune system helps to destroy skin cells which have been damaged by the sun. These cells, if not removed by the immune system, may go on to multiply and cause cancer. It may also be that viruses (such as human papillomavirus - HPV, or herpes viruses) involved in some cancers are more likely to be present if the immune system is suppressed. Some immune-suppressing medicines may directly affect skin cells in a way which makes them more likely to develop skin cancers.
When to see a doctor for immunosuppression
The immune system of healthy people can fight off most minor infections within days without any medical input. That's why with most minor infections, healthy people are encouraged to take a wait-and-see approach. This means treating the symptoms and seeking medical advice if they feel very unwell or the infection is not starting to settle on its own after a week or so.
In someone with immunosuppression, however, even a mild infection can become serious very quickly. Infections caught early can be treated quickly, preventing them from spreading. Someone who is immunosuppressed is more likely to be given an antibiotic for a mild infection compared with someone who is not immunosuppressed.
People on immunosuppressant medication and those undergoing active cancer treatment should be advised by their specialist team when to seek medical help. Many people who have had a splenectomy or who have a poorly functioning spleen will be on regular antibiotics or will be aware when to seek medical attention. Most people in the UK with HIV are on medication which means their immune system is no longer suppressed and, therefore, are not usually more at risk of infections; however, this may not be the case for people living with HIV in all parts of the world.
A medication called carbimazole which is used to treat an over-active thyroid gland can suppress one particular white blood cell. People on this medication will have been advised to seek urgent medical help if they have a sore throat as an urgent blood test would be needed.
People with certain immunosuppressant conditions or on particular immunosuppressant medications were advised to be started on anti-viral medications if they had a positive covid test. This can normally be accessed by a central covid team in each area of the UK.
It is important to seek urgent medical attention if immunosuppressed and:
Having a high temperature (fever) over 38°C.

All this also applies to children who are immunosuppressed but medical attention should also be sought urgently for an immunosuppressed child who is breathing rapidly or not eating or drinking as normal.
An immunosuppressed person who develops any scaly areas which don't clear up quickly with a good moisturising cream, or a new mole or one which has changed, should seek medical advice..
Can immunosuppression be treated?
It all depends on the cause. In some cases it can be treated, in others it is managed. For example:
HIV infection and AIDS are treated with specific anti-HIV medication. See the separate leaflet called HIV and AIDS.

Immunosuppression caused by medication should reverse if the medication is stopped. If the immunosuppression is causing harm then sometimes an alternative can be used or the dose changed. In other cases, infection can be quickly managed as and when it occurs, while the medication is continued.

How is immune suppressant medication monitored?
This varies with the individual medication. Some medicines require regular blood tests. These monitor your blood cells (white cells, red cells and platelets) and check that the numbers aren't getting too low. There may also be blood tests to check the medication isn't affecting the liver or kidney function.
For other immune-suppressing medication, a regular blood test might be advised to see how well it is working.
It may also vary over time. For example, for some medicines, such as methotrexate, initial blood tests will be very frequent (every one to two weeks), but this will reduce to every 12 weeks once the medication dose is stable.
Monitoring requirements will be advised by the specialist initiating this medication.
Why would the spleen be removed?
The spleen is an important part of your immune system but sometimes it needs to be removed with an operation called a splenectomy. This may be necessary after an accident or an injury where the spleen is ruptured (which would lead to significant blood loss if not treated quickly).
Sometimes the spleen becomes too large and destroys too many blood cells. Examples where this occurs and the spleen may need to be removed include:
Immune thrombocytopenia.
Immune thrombocytopenia.
Hereditary spherocytosis.
Hereditary spherocytosis.
Hereditary elliptocytosis.
Hereditary elliptocytosis.
Lymphomas and leukaemias.
Lymphomas and leukaemias.
See the separate leaflets called Spleen Pain and Preventing infection after Splenectomy for more information about the spleen.
Travelling with immunosuppression
It is wise to plan very carefully for travel due to the risks of infection. All travel vaccinations which are advised for the particular destination should be had in good time (although certain live vaccines might be advised against).
Caution should be employed travelling to countries with high risk of diseases that cannot be vaccinated against. Equally it is best to avoid going to places where good medical care is difficult to access in case of an emergency. It is important to travel with information about the condition and/or medication in case this needs to be seen by a health professional when travelling.
It is important to check that the travel insurance is adequate for every condition and / or medication. "In case" antibiotics are no longer recommended as it is always best to seek medical help at the time of need.
It is important to take the usual precautions to avoid food poisoning/traveller's diarrhoea if visiting somewhere this might be a risk, and to use plenty of high-factor sun cream to protect the skin.

Anaemia means that you have fewer red blood cells than normal or you have less haemoglobin than normal in each red blood cell. In either case, a reduced amount of oxygen is carried around in the bloodstream.

Anaemia types and causes
Iron-deficiency anaemia
Lack of iron is the most common type of anaemia in the UK. This is called iron-deficiency anaemia. If you eat a normal balanced diet, it usually contains enough iron.
See the separate leaflet called Diets Suitable for People with Anaemia.
See also the separate leaflet called Iron-deficiency Anaemia.
Vitamin deficiency anaemia
Lack of certain vitamins such as folic acid and vitamin B12 can cause anaemia.
See the separate leaflets called Folic Acid Deficiency Anaemia and Vitamin B12 Deficiency and Pernicious Anaemia.
Haemolytic anaemia
Normally, red blood cells live for about 120 days before they are broken down by the body. In haemolytic anaemia they live for a much shorter time. The anaemia occurs because your bone marrow cannot produce enough new red blood cells to replace the ones that are being broken down too quickly.
There are several reasons that this happens. Genetic conditions where there is an abnormality in the red cell membrane such as hereditary spherocytosis, or elliptocytosis. Conditions where there are haemoglobin abnormalities such as sickle cell anaemia or thalassaemia - these are discussed below. And problems with the chemicals (or enzymes) that help the blood cell do its job, such as G6PD deficiency and pyruvate kinase deficiency.
Another set of conditions may arise from your immune system attacking your own red blood cells, such as autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, blood transfusion reactions and other autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus.
Some medications may cause haemolysis, such as penicillin. You can also have haemolysis caused by mechanical heart valves, malaria and liver disease. There is a wide variety of reasons you might develop haemolytic anaemia.
Thalassaemia
Thalassaemia is an inherited condition affecting the blood. There are different types, which vary from a mild condition with no symptoms, to a serious or life-threatening condition. For the more severe forms of thalassaemia, modern treatment gives a good outlook, but lifelong monitoring and treatment are needed. Good treatment is important to prevent complications developing.
Sickle cell anaemia
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a serious, inherited condition affecting the blood and various organs in the body. It affects the red blood cells, causing episodes of 'sickling', which produce episodes of pain and other symptoms. In between episodes of sickling, people with SCD are normally well. Long-term complications can occur. Good treatment, started early in life, can prevent complications. So, early diagnosis and specialist treatment are advised for SCD. Sickle cell trait is not the same as sickle cell disease.
Aplastic anaemia
Aplastic anaemia is a group of disorders that cause bone marrow failure. Most often no cause is found but there are also some inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. Sometimes a trigger can cause aplastic anaemia, and examples of those include drugs, viruses and toxins.
Anaemia of chronic disease
Some long-term illnesses may lead to anaemia. These include chronic kidney disease, tuberculosis, chronic heart failure and malnutrition. We don't fully understand why the anaemia happens but it may be partly due to reduced production of new red blood cells. Sometimes the anaemia is mild and doesn't need treatment but there are several treatment options available as well as treating the underlying disease.
Risk factors for anaemia
Some conditions that cause anaemia are inherited, so having a close family member who has that condition will increase your risk.
Some medications may have an effect on the bone marrow, or on red blood cells, and cause anaemia.
The following are some situations that may have a risk of developing a lack of iron and result in iron-deficiency anaemia:
Pregnancy or childhood growth spurts. These are times when you need more iron than usual. The amount of iron that you eat during these times may not be enough.

Bleeding from the gut (intestines). Some conditions of the gut can bleed enough to cause anaemia. You may not be aware of losing blood this way. The bleeding may be slow or intermittent and you can pass blood out with your stools (faeces) without noticing.

Various other symptoms may develop, depending on the underlying cause of the anaemia.
Anaemia diagnosis
A simple blood test can measure the amount of haemoglobin in your blood and count the number of red blood cells per millilitre (ml). Although this test can confirm that you are anaemic, it does not identify the cause of your anaemia.
Sometimes the underlying cause is obvious. For example, pregnant women and women who have heavy menstrual periods may commonly develop iron-deficient anaemia.. In these situations, no further tests may be needed and treatment with iron supplements may be advised. However, the cause of the anaemia may not be clear and so further tests may be advised.
Some causes of anaemia are more serious than others and it is important to find the reason for anaemia.
Anaemia treatment
The treatment of anaemia depends on the underlying cause. For people with iron-deficiency anaemia this may simply be iron tablets. People who do not respond well to medication may be offered a blood transfusion if they are having severe symptoms.
Those with B12 deficiency will need vitamin B12 injections. The injections are usually given frequently at the start of treatment. This quickly builds up the body's store of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is stored in the liver. Once a store of vitamin B12 has built up, this can supply the body's needs for several months. An injection is then only usually needed every two to three months to top up the supply.
Folic acid deficiency is treated with tablets in addition to a folate-rich diet. The tablets can be stopped if your diet improves. You may need to continue with treatment if a poor diet was not the cause of folic acid deficiency.
Currently there is no cure for sickle cell disease (SCD) other than a stem cell transplant, so lifelong treatment and monitoring are needed. There are a number of different treatments which help to prevent sickling episodes, or prevent related problems such as infection. Sometimes you might need a blood transfusion. For others it may be a course of vitamins or other more complex treatments.
Anaemia of chronic disease cannot be treated by supplements or tablets. Treatments that stimulate the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells are needed.
Anaemia outlook
For the most common types of anaemia, (iron deficiency, B12 or folic acid deficiency) there are relatively simple treatments and these should keep you well. For the more complex types of anaemia (sickle cell, thalassaemia, aplastic anaemia) treatment is more complex. For example, sickle cell disease may shorten life. Without treatment, people with SCD may die in childhood, from problems such as infection. Good treatment makes a great difference. Improvements in treatment mean that life expectancy has increased. However, even with modern treatment, SCD can still cause serious or life-threatening problems.
The outlook associated with the anaemia of chronic disease, is more about the severity of the underlying condition.

What is folic acid deficiency?
Folic acid deficiency is a lack of folic acid in the blood. Folic acid (also known as folate) is a B vitamin and is needed to make new cells in your body, including red blood cells. Your body does not store very much folic acid. You need a regular fresh supply to keep healthy. If you do not have enough folic acid you may become anaemic.
What are the symptoms of folic acid deficiency?
Some people do not have any symptoms of folic acid deficiency. In these cases it is picked up on a blood test done for another reason, before they have a chance to develop symptoms.
Folic acid deficiency anaemia
Symptoms due to anaemia are caused by the reduced amount of oxygen in the body.

What are the causes of folic acid deficiency?
Not eating enough foods containing folic acid (folate)
This is the most common cause. This occurs most often in elderly people who do not eat well. Alcohol-dependent people are another group often not eating properly. Good sources of folic acid include: broccoli, brussels sprouts, asparagus, peas, chickpeas and brown rice. You can find out more about foods high in folic acid from our leaflet called Diets Suitable for People with Anaemia.
Pregnancy
Pregnancy causes reserves of folic acid in your body to be used by the growing baby. You are at risk of becoming low in folic acid during the later stages of pregnancy, particularly if you do not eat well during pregnancy.
The gut
Some uncommon conditions of the gut may cause poor absorption of folic acid - for example, coeliac disease.
Blood disorders
Some blood disorders can lead to a very high turnover of red blood cells - for example, sickle cell disease and thalassaemia. Normal amounts of folic acid in the diet may then not be enough and supplements may need to be taken.
Inflammatory conditions
Some inflammatory conditions can lead to low folic acid levels - for example, severe Crohn's disease. However, this is less common.
Medicines
Some medicines interfere with folic acid. Therefore, you may need to take extra folic acid whilst taking certain medicines. These include colestyramine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate and some anticonvulsant medicines used to treat epilepsy. If you are needing dialysis then you may be recommended to take folic acid supplements.
Complications of folic acid deficiency
Complications of folic acid deficiency are rare but can occur, especially if you have been deficient in folic acid for some time.
When folic acid causes anaemia this can lead to heart problems, especially in the elderly.

When a pregnant woman has folic acid deficiency there is an increased chance of birth defects such as spina bifida.
How is folic acid deficiency diagnosed?
A blood test can confirm folic acid deficiency and whether you are anaemic. It is also very common to have a blood test for your vitamin B12 levels at the same time, as these can also be low. Read more in the separate leaflet called Vitamin B12 Deficiency and Pernicious Anaemia. You may need further tests to check for an underlying cause of the folic acid deficiency.
Folic acid deficiency treatment
Treatment for folic acid deficiency is easy and includes:
Taking a tablet of folic acid (folate) each day.
Taking a tablet of folic acid (folate) each day.
Following a balanced diet.
Following a balanced diet.
You need to take the tablet until the folic acid stores in the body are built up and any anaemia is corrected (usually for about four months).
You may need advice on diet to stay well and the tablets can be stopped if your diet improves. You may need to continue with treatment if a poor diet was not the cause of folic acid deficiency.
For example, if you have sickle cell disease you may need to take a folic acid tablet each day indefinitely. See the separate leaflet called Diets Suitable for People with Anaemia.
Folic acid and pregnancy
Extra folic acid (folate) is advised for at least the first 12 weeks of pregnancy for all women - even if you are healthy and have a good diet. If you take extra folic acid in early pregnancy you have less chance of having a baby born with a spinal cord problem such as spina bifida.
It is best to start taking the extra folic acid before becoming pregnant. If the pregnancy is unplanned then start taking folic acid as soon as you know you are pregnant. You can buy folic acid tablets at most health food shops or pharmacies.
For most women the dose is 400 micrograms (0.4 mg) a day.
