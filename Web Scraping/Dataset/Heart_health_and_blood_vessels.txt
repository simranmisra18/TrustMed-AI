High blood pressure (hypertension) happens when the force on the walls of blood vessels (caused by the blood within them) is more than normal. This means the heart has to work harder and the blood vessels are under more strain, making it a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke and other serious conditions.

What is high blood pressure?
High blood pressure is a blood pressure that is:
140/90 mm Hg or higher when taken at a GP surgery, pharmacy, or clinic, or;
140/90 mm Hg or higher when taken at a GP surgery, pharmacy, or clinic, or;
135/85 mm Hg or higher when taken at home.
135/85 mm Hg or higher when taken at home.
Blood pressure normally goes up and down throughout the day, depending on what someone is doing. It's also normal for blood pressure to go up for a short time if someone is feeling stressed, anxious, or in pain.
So, a single raised blood pressure reading is not enough to say that someone has high blood pressure. But if your blood pressure readings are checked again at different times, and are raised most, or all, of the time, it shows that you have high blood pressure.
As a rough guide, the ideal blood pressure for adults is between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg.
What is high blood pressure?
Understanding a blood pressure reading
Blood pressure readings are given as two numbers, eg 130/80. The first number is the systolic blood pressure, and is the blood pressure when the heart is pushing blood out through the body.
The second number is the diastolic blood pressure, and is the blood pressure when the heart is filling with blood between heartbeats. Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (mm Hg).
A one-off blood pressure reading that is high does not mean high blood pressure. Blood pressure varies throughout the day. It may be high for a short time, such as when anxious, stressed, or after exercise. This is normal, and short-term rises in blood pressure don't cause problems. However, if blood pressure is raised for a long time (months or years), it can cause serious health problems.
Heart health and blood vessels
More than 1 in 4 adults have high blood pressure (hypertension), a condition that can lead to kidney damage, stroke and heart disease. It's important to get your blood pressure checked regularly. But if you've already been told yours is in the high region, these lifestyle tips can help you reduce it.

Heart health and blood vessels
Blood pressure recording outside of the doctor's surgery is recommended in most people who are suspected of having high blood pressure. This is because readings taken while people are going about their daily lives are more accurate than those taken in a doctor's surgery. They may also be used to give the doctor information about how well a blood pressure medicine is working. The ideal method is ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, which uses a portable recorder. If this is inconvenient or uncomfortable, readings can be taken using a traditional blood pressure machine at home.
by Dr Colin Tidy, MRCGP
High blood pressure symptoms
High blood pressure usually doesn't cause any symptoms at all, and so the only way to know if your blood pressure is high is to get it checked.
Usually high blood pressure is only picked up if blood pressure is checked routinely, or as part of checks for another medical problem.
Rarely, very high blood pressure can cause symptoms such as:
Headaches.

Dizziness.

Risks of having high blood pressure
High blood pressure over a long period of time (years) increases the risk of developing serious health problems.
High blood pressure causes damage to blood vessels, making them weaker or narrower, and increases strain on the heart. In general, the higher the blood pressure, the greater the risk of serious problems.
Untreated high blood pressure can lead to:
Heart attack.

What causes high blood pressure?
It isn't always clear what might be causing high blood pressure. However, the risk of developing high blood pressure is increased if a person:
Has diabetes. This is the case for type 1 diabetes but it is even more common in those with type 2 diabetes.

How is high blood pressure diagnosed?
Unless a single level is extremely high, high blood pressure shouldn't be diagnosed without an average of several readings, usually from measuring repeatedly at home, or 'ambulatory' measurements (using a monitor worn for 24 hours).
One reason for this is because some people become anxious in medical clinics. This can cause the blood pressure to rise. Home or ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure may show that the blood pressure is actually normal most of the time when a person is relaxed.
However, if a person has diabetes, or has recently had a heart attack or stroke, blood pressure checks may be advised more often over the following week or so. Treatment with medication is usually considered at an earlier stage if the high blood pressure readings remain high.
How is blood pressure measured?
The first blood pressure reading will usually be in a clinic, pharmacy, or GP's surgery. If one reading is found to be high, it is usually best to wait a bit and recheck it. They might suggest rechecking it after a few minutes, or coming back on another day to recheck.
They might also recommend that you do home or ambulatory readings to see what your blood pressure levels are like over a longer period of time.
Blood pressure readings can be divided into:
Clinic/GP surgery blood pressure readings
These are readings taken by a doctor or nurse in a clinic or a GP surgery, using a standard blood pressure machine.
Home blood pressure readings
This involves a machine to take blood pressure readings at home. Blood pressure readings are taken by a person whilst seated and at rest at home, using a standard blood pressure machine.
The blood pressure readings are taken twice a day for a week. This can then provide an average reading. It's normal for blood pressure to fluctuate, so a single raised reading isn't a cause for concern unless it's extremely high.
Ambulatory blood pressure readings
These are readings taken at regular intervals during normal activities. A small machine that is attached to the arm takes and records the readings, usually over a 24-hour period.
As a rule, an average of the ambulatory blood pressure readings gives the truest account of blood pressure. Home blood pressure readings are a good substitute if an ambulatory machine is not available.
Ambulatory and home readings are often a bit lower than clinic or GP surgery readings. Sometimes they are a lot lower. This is because people are often much more relaxed and less stressed at home than in a formal clinic or surgery situation.
See the separate leaflet called Home and ambulatory blood pressure recording.
What other tests are done for high blood pressure?
People who are diagnosed with high blood pressure (hypertension) should have some routine tests which include:
A urine test to check for protein or blood in the urine.
A urine test to check for protein or blood in the urine.
A blood test to check that the kidneys are working normally and to check cholesterol level and sugar (glucose) level.
A blood test to check that the kidneys are working normally and to check cholesterol level and sugar (glucose) level.
A heart tracing, called an electrocardiogram (ECG).

How to reduce high blood pressure
Lifestyle changes can be very important to help reduce blood pressure and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. In some people diagnosed with high blood pressure, this may help them to avoid medication. In particular, the following may help:
Losing weight if overweight.

Keeping alcohol intake to within recommended limits.

Stopping smoking doesn't reduce blood pressure, but smoking and high blood pressure increase the risk of the same conditions. So quitting smoking will reduce the risk of conditions such as strokes, heart attacks, peripheral arterial disease and chronic kidney disease.
See the separate leaflet called Living with high blood pressure.
Treatments for high blood pressure
High blood pressure medication
The main treatment for high blood pressure is medication. There are many different medicines for high blood pressure. There are six main classes of medicines that are used to lower blood pressure:
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.
Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).
Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).
Calcium-channel blockers.
Calcium-channel blockers.
Thiazide diuretics.
Thiazide diuretics.
Beta-blockers.
Beta-blockers.
Alpha blockers.
Alpha blockers.
They work in various different ways. A doctor will advise on the best one to use for any individual as the most effective medicine will depend on a few different factors. If the first medicine doesn't work well enough or causes side effects, there are plenty of other options. More than one medicine is often needed to control high blood pressure.
The idea is to find one or more pills which suit an individual, and which control blood pressure. Once blood pressure is controlled, medication needs to be continued long-term. Blood pressure will be checked regularly and medication adjusted if need be.

Cholesterol is a fat chemical (lipid) that is made in the cells in your body. Many different cells make cholesterol but cells in the liver make about a quarter of the total. You need some cholesterol to keep healthy.

What is high cholesterol?
High cholesterol refers to elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood. If your cholesterol levels are high, this can increase the chance of build-up of fatty deposits in your arteries. This increases the risk of heart attack and stroke.
Cholesterol is carried in the blood by particles called lipoproteins. When low-density lipoproteins (LDL cholesterol) carry cholesterol this is referred to as 'bad' cholesterol. Higher levels of LDL cholesterol in your blood cause an increased risk of lipoprotein disorders and cardiovascular disease (heart and blood vessel diseases, such as heart attack and stroke).
However, some cholesterol in your blood is carried by high-density lipoproteins (HDL cholesterol). HDL cholesterol can be thought of as 'good' cholesterol and higher levels help to prevent cardiovascular disease.
Other factors that can reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease include not smoking, choosing healthy foods, a low salt intake, regular physical activity, keeping your weight and waist size down and drinking alcohol in moderation (if at all). Ensuring your blood pressure level is not raised (or taking medication to lower it if it is high) is also important.
See the separate leaflet called Cardiovascular disease (Atheroma).
What are the symptoms of high cholesterol?
Most people with high cholesterol have no symptoms. Very occasionally, some people have fatty, cholesterol-rich deposits which are visible under their skin. These are called xanthelasma or xanthoma. Another rare visible sign is an arcus senilis - a white ring around the cornea (the coloured part of the eye).
Heart health and blood vessels
By now, the health risks of high cholesterol are well documented. But do you need to change every aspect of your lifestyle to protect yourself against heart disease and stroke or can diet alone tame your cholesterol levels?
by Milly Evans
Heart health and blood vessels
Familial hypercholesterolaemia is inherited high cholesterol. It is a condition where you have a very high cholesterol level in your blood.
by Dr Colin Tidy, MRCGP
What causes high cholesterol?
Everybody has some risk of developing small fatty lumps (atheroma) within the inside lining of blood vessels, which then may cause one or more cardiovascular diseases. However, some situations increase the risk. These include:
Lifestyle risk factors that can be prevented or changed:
Smoking.
Lack of physical activity (a sedentary lifestyle).
Obesity.
An unhealthy diet - including eating too much salt.
Excess alcohol.

However, if you have a fixed risk factor, you may want to make extra effort to tackle any lifestyle risk factors that can be changed. See the separate leaflet called Cardiovascular disease (Atheroma).
Note: risk factors interact. So, if you have two or more risk factors, your health risk is much more increased than if you just have one. For example, a middle-aged male smoker who has high blood pressure and a high cholesterol level has a high risk of developing a cardiovascular disease, such as a heart attack, before the age of 60.
Testing for high cholesterol
Cholesterol levels are tested with a simple blood test. This can be done in two ways. The blood can be taken from your arm with a needle and sent to a lab for analysis. The result will come back in a few days. In some places it is possible to have your cholesterol tested with a finger prick test. This gives the result in a few minutes. It is not usually necessary to fast before cholesterol tests.
Cholesterol blood levels
Cholesterol blood levels are very important but must be considered in an overall assessment of your risk of cardiovascular disease (see below). The following blood cholesterol levels are generally regarded as desirable for people who are otherwise at low risk:
Total cholesterol (TChol): 5.0 mmol/L or less. However, about 2 in 3 adults in the UK have a TChol level of 5.0 mmol/L or above.
Total cholesterol (TChol): 5.0 mmol/L or less. However, about 2 in 3 adults in the UK have a TChol level of 5.0 mmol/L or above.
LDL cholesterol: 3.0 mmol/L or less.
LDL cholesterol: 3.0 mmol/L or less.
HDL cholesterol: 1.2 mmol/L or more.
HDL cholesterol: 1.2 mmol/L or more.
TChol/HDL ratio: 4.5 or less. That is, your TChol divided by your HDL cholesterol. This reflects the fact that for any given TChol level, the more HDL, the better.
TChol/HDL ratio: 4.5 or less. That is, your TChol divided by your HDL cholesterol. This reflects the fact that for any given TChol level, the more HDL, the better.
If other factors mean you are at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease - eg, you have had a stroke - it is recommended that your target levels for LDL cholesterol should be lower.
As a rule, the higher the LDL cholesterol level, the greater the risk to health. A blood test only measuring total cholesterol may be misleading. A high total cholesterol may be caused by a high HDL cholesterol level and is therefore healthy. It is very important to know the separate LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels.
Your level of LDL cholesterol has to be viewed as part of your overall cardiovascular health risk. The cardiovascular health risk from any given level of LDL cholesterol can vary, depending on the level of your HDL cholesterol and on any other health risk factors that you may have. Therefore, a cardiovascular risk assessment considers all your risk factors together.
What factors affect the blood level of cholesterol?
To an extent your blood cholesterol level can vary depending on your diet. However, different people who eat the same diet can have different blood cholesterol levels. In general, however, if you eat less fatty food in your diet your cholesterol level is likely to go down.
In some people a high cholesterol level is due to another condition. For example, an underactive thyroid gland, obesity, drinking a lot of alcohol and some rare kidney and liver disorders can raise the cholesterol level. Hyperlipidaemia means too much lipid (particularly cholesterol) in your bloodstream. See the separate leaflet called Hyperlipidaemia.
In some people a very high level of cholesterol runs in the family, due to a genetic problem with the way cholesterol is made by the cells in the body. One example is called familial hypercholesterolaemia. See the separate leaflet called Familial hypercholesterolaemia.
What are the benefits of lowering my cholesterol level?
If you have a high risk of developing a cardiovascular disease, or you already have a cardiovascular disease, lowering your LDL cholesterol level reduces your risk of developing future cardiovascular problems.
For details on exactly how much risk is reduced by lowering and treating risk factors, find out more about the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Clinical Knowledge Summary (NICE CKS), 'Cardiovascular risk assessment and management' (note UK access only).
What is the treatment for high cholesterol?
Changing your diet
Changing from an unhealthy diet to a healthy diet can reduce your LDL cholesterol level. It is advisable to reduce the saturated fat and trans fat in your diet. However, dietary changes alone rarely lower an LDL cholesterol level enough to change a person's risk of cardiovascular disease from a high-risk category to a lower-risk category.
Statins
A medicine (usually a medicine called a statin) is often used if you are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Read about cholesterol-lowering treatments in the separate leaflet called Hyperlipidaemia.
What if I am at low risk?
Even if you have a low risk of cardiovascular disease it is still very important to follow the healthy lifestyle advice. This advice, including healthy eating, regular exercise, not smoking and drinking alcohol only in moderation (if at all), will help to keep your risk of cardiovascular disease as low as possible.

What are statins used for?
Your doctor will advise if you should take a statin. A statin is usually advised if:
You have a high cholesterol level (or high levels of other fats in the blood, called hyperlipidaemia - read more about hyperlipidaemia and familial hypercholesterolaemia).
You have a high cholesterol level (or high levels of other fats in the blood, called hyperlipidaemia - read more about hyperlipidaemia and familial hypercholesterolaemia).
You have an atheroma-related disease. This is a cardiovascular disease such as angina or peripheral arterial disease, or you have had a heart attack (myocardial infarction), stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). A statin helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease getting worse, or of you having further heart attacks, TIAs or strokes.

A statin helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease getting worse, or of you having further heart attacks, TIAs or strokes.
You have a high increased risk of developing heart disease. Risk is measured as a percentage. Risk is considered to be high when your score is 10% or more (that is, a 1 in 10 chance or more of developing a cardiovascular disease within the 10 years that follow). See the separate leaflet called Cardiovascular health risk assessment.

Risk is considered to be high when your score is 10% or more (that is, a 1 in 10 chance or more of developing a cardiovascular disease within the 10 years that follow). See the separate leaflet called Cardiovascular health risk assessment.
Note: a statin is just one factor in reducing your risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. See the separate leaflet called Cardiovascular disease (Atheroma).
What happens when you take a statin?
You should have a blood test before starting treatment. This checks the level of cholesterol. It also checks if your liver is working properly.
After starting treatment you should have a blood test in 2-3 months and again at 12 months. The blood test is to check that the liver has not been affected by the medication. The blood may also be checked to measure the cholesterol level to see how well the statin is working.
What is the target cholesterol level to aim for?
There is no actual target cholesterol blood level for people who do not already have cardiovascular disease. However, national guidelines recommend that people who have not been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, but would benefit from taking a statin to reduce their risk of this, should be started on atorvastatin 20 mg a day. This is a 'high-intensity' statin - the aim of giving high-intensity statins is to reduce your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (sometimes called the 'bad cholesterol') by at least 40%.
If you do have a cardiovascular disease the aim, if possible, is to reduce LDL cholesterol to less than 2.0 mmol/L, or non-HDL cholesterol to 2.6mmol/L or less. If the target is not reached at first, the dose may need to be increased or a different preparation used. National guidelines recommend that for people who have cardiovascular disease, the drug of choice is atorvastatin 80 mg a day.
A study of over 165,000 patients taking statins has shown that about half of people taking statins did not reduce their LDL cholesterol by at least 40%. There may be several reasons for this, including people not taking their statin tablets regularly. However, people who were not prescribed 'high-intensity statins' (such as atorvastatin 20-80 mg a day) were less likely to reach this target.
Once age and starting cholesterol level were taken into account, people who did not reach this 40% target were 22% more likely to have a heart attack or stroke over the following six years.
If you are taking a statin, you may want to ask your GP or practice nurse what your pre-treatment and on-treatment levels of LDL cholesterol are. If your cholesterol has not reduced by at least 40% on treatment, you could discuss your medication with your doctor.
Side-effects of statins
Most people who take a statin have no side-effects, or only minor ones. Read the information leaflet that comes with your medicine. It will have a full list of possible side-effects. It is always important to discuss the risks and benefits of any treatment with your healthcare professional or pharmacist.
Possible statin side-effects include:

Do's and don'ts of taking statins
Do
Tell your doctor if you have any unexpected muscle pains, tenderness, cramps or weakness. This is because a rare side-effect of statins is a severe form of muscle inflammation. Your doctor may need to adjust your dose of statin to reduce the risk.

Remind your doctor or pharmacist you are on a statin if you are prescribed (or buy) another medication. This is because various other medicines may interfere with statins - for example, some antibiotics and ciclosporin. The doses of either the statin or the other interacting medicine may need to be adjusted.

This is because various other medicines may interfere with statins - for example, some antibiotics and ciclosporin. The doses of either the statin or the other interacting medicine may need to be adjusted.
Don't
Take a statin if you have active liver disease, if you are pregnant or intend to be pregnant, or if you are breastfeeding. You should stop a statin if you develop liver disease.

Eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice if you are taking some statins. A chemical in grapefruit can increase the level of statin in the bloodstream, which can make side-effects from the statin more likely. This is only a problem with simvastatin, atorvastatin and lovastatin. Other statins, such as pravastatin, do not interact with grapefruit.

Alternatives to statins
Statins are the most effective medicines for reducing cholesterol levels for most people. However, there are other medicines that are sometimes used if statins can't be used or aren't sufficiently effective. These include:
Ezetimibe is sometimes used in certain situations in combination with a statin, or on its own. It prevents the absorption of cholesterol from the gut. It is now recommended as the main alternative for people who cannot take statins

Bile acid sequestrants which include colestyramine, colesevelam and colestipol. They work by binding to bile acids which are passed into the gut from the liver and gallbladder. This stops bile acids being re-absorbed into the bloodstream, which has a knock-on effect of lowering cholesterol. Bile acid sequestrants may be used during pregnancy because they are safe while statins can't be used during pregnancy. They are not recommended routinely otherwise.

Bempedoic acid is another type of medicine which helps to reduce cholesterol levels and is used particularly in people who don't respond to other cholesterol-lowering medication. It is also available in combination with ezetimibe.

Fish oils may help to reduce blood lipid levels. These occur naturally in oily fish such as mackerel. This is why at least 1-2 portions of oily fish per week are recommended in a healthy diet. Dietary supplements ('fish oil tablets', which contain omega-3 fatty acids) are also available. However, the value of fish oil supplements is controversial, as the evidence from research trials is unclear.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended inclisiran, alirocumab or evolocumab as an option for reducing cholesterol in some patients with high cholesterol that has not responded to statins or ezetimibe.
NICE has also recommended a medication called icosapent ethyl for those people who:
Are already taking a statin.

Have controlled levels of LDL cholesterol.

Have high levels of triglycerides; and
Have high levels of triglycerides; and
Have a high risk of having a cardiovascular event.
Have a high risk of having a cardiovascular event.
This is because evidence has shown that icosapent ethyl reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in these people. See Further Reading below for more information.
Where to buy statins
Statin medicines are available on prescription and funded by the NHS in the UK if you have a cardiovascular disease, or you have a high risk of developing a cardiovascular disease. A statin is not usually prescribed for people with lower levels of risk.
Some statins are available to buy without a prescription. Some people choose to buy a statin to lower their cholesterol level.
However, statins are an addition and not a replacement for changing lifestyle factors to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. Everyone should follow a healthy lifestyle of not smoking, maintaining a healthy body weight, eating a healthy diet, getting regular physical exercise and only drinking alcohol in moderation. See the leaflet on Cardiovascular disease for more information.

What is bradycardia?
Bradycardia means that your heart beats very slowly. For most people, their resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm).
Low heart rate
A low heart rate (fewer than 60 bpm) may sometimes be normal and can be a sign of being very fit. This normal slow heartbeat doesn't cause any problems and does not need any treatment. This is called sinus bradycardia, with a reduced rate of the electrical signal that controls the heart beat. Sinus bradycardia is common, particularly in well-conditioned athletes. Bradycardia is also normal during sleep.
What causes bradycardia?
However, sometimes bradycardia is caused by an underlying medical condition and does cause symptoms.
Bradycardia may be a sign of a problem with the heart's electrical impulses. It means that the heart's natural pacemaker isn't working right (eg, sick sinus syndrome) or that the electrical pathways of the heart are disrupted (eg, heart block).
In severe forms of bradycardia, the heart beats so slowly that it doesn't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This can cause symptoms and can be life-threatening.
When to worry about low heart rate
A low heart rate is often harmless but the causes of bradycardia include various heart conditions or other conditions such as hypothyroidism. Symptoms associated with a low heart rate that need to be assessed and investigated by a healthcare professional include:
Lack of energy.

Risk factors
There are many possible causes. Bradycardia may be normal, especially in young very fit people. Otherwise, the possible causes include:
Abnormal conduction of the electrical impulse that stimulates the heart to pump blood around your body. Read more about abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias).

How is bradycardia diagnosed?
Taking your pulse rate reveals a very slow heartbeat.

Bradycardia treatment and management
The treatment depends on the underlying cause and the symptoms. If the bradycardia isn't causing any symptoms there is no need for any treatment unless treatment is needed for the underlying cause of the bradycardia.
If damage to the heart's electrical system causes your heart to beat too slowly, you may need to have a pacemaker. A pacemaker is a device placed under your skin that helps correct the low heart rate. People who have a pacemaker can lead normal, active lives; however, this will also depend on the underlying condition.
If another medical problem, such as hypothyroidism or an imbalance of salts (electrolytes), is causing a low heart rate then treating the cause will often cure the bradycardia.
If a medicine is causing your heart to beat too slowly, your doctor may lower the dose of the medicine or change it to a different medicine.
Always obtain emergency help (in the UK, call 999) if you, or someone near you, have collapsed or if you have symptoms of a heart attack, such as severe chest pain or severe shortness of breath.
Also seek emergency help if your heart rate is slower than usual and you feel like you might pass out, or if you notice increased shortness of breath.
Complications
For most people, bradycardia will not cause any complications. Any complications will depend on the underlying cause of the slow heart rate.
If severe bradycardia isn't treated, it can lead to serious problems. These may include:
Sudden collapse.
Sudden collapse.
Fits (seizures).
