A kidney infection (pyelonephritis) is an unpleasant illness which is sometimes serious. Treatment usually involves medicines called antibiotics and also painkillers. If the kidney was previously healthy then you are likely to make a full recovery. Complications occur in some cases. Complications include kidney damage or a spread of infection around the body (sepsis).

Understanding the kidneys and urinary tract
What is a kidney infection?
A kidney infection (pyelonephritis) is a type of urinary tract infection (UTI). It is caused by bacteria travelling from your bladder into one or both of your kidneys and causing an infection there.
This leaflet only deals with sudden-onset (acute) kidney infection in adults. The medical term for this is acute pyelonephritis. This leaflet does not deal with chronic pyelonephritis, which is a condition where the kidney is scarred as a result of repeated infections.
Kidney infection symptoms
Symptoms usually develop quickly, over a few hours or so, and may include:
Pain in a loin or flank. (This is the area at the side of your back where the kidney is located).

There will also usually be symptoms of a bladder infection - for example, pain on passing urine, and going to the toilet often.
There will also usually be symptoms of a bladder infection - for example, pain on passing urine, and going to the toilet often.
Not all of the symptoms may develop, and sometimes a kidney infection can just cause vague symptoms. For example, just feeling generally unwell but not being able to say why.
In older people a kidney infection may cause confusion. This is why a urine test is often done when an elderly person suddenly becomes confused or appears generally unwell.
Causes of a kidney infection
Most kidney infections develop from a bladder infection (cystitis). Bacteria travel up the tube between the bladder and kidney (ureter) to infect a kidney. These bacteria are usually those normally living in the bowel - eg, E. coli. Most people with cystitis don't get a kidney infection.
Some kidney infections develop without a bladder infection. This is sometimes due to a problem in the kidney. For example, people are more prone to kidney infections if they have a kidney stone or an abnormality of the kidney.
It is usually only one kidney that develops an infection. A kidney infection can occur at any age. It is much more common in women. This is because women are more at risk of developing a bladder infection (which can spread to the kidneys).
In women, the urethra is closer to the anus, which makes it easier for bacteria to get from the bowel to the urethra. The urethra is also shorter in women than in men, so bacteria can reach the bladder more easily.
Kidney infections are also more common in children, during pregnancy and in older people. They are uncommon in healthy men.
How common are kidney infections?
Kidney infections are much less common than infections in the bladder. However, although they are uncommon in adults, about 1 in 30 girls and 1 in 100 boys will have had a kidney infection (acute pyelonephritis) by the time they are 7 years old.

Diagnosing a kidney infection
A simple test that your doctor can do is called a dipstick urine test. This involves testing a sample of your urine with a special testing strip to look for signs of infection. This test will show if a kidney infection is likely or not.
However, it is important to confirm the diagnosis and also to find out which germ (bacterium) is causing the infection. This will enable a doctor to prescribe the correct antibiotic. For this, your doctor will need to send your urine sample to the laboratory so that the bacterium can be identified and tests can be done to see which antibiotics will kill it.
As this may take some days for the results, treatment is usually started straightaway. A urine sample may be the only test that is needed if you are a woman who is otherwise healthy, but develop cystitis which progresses to a kidney infection.
Further tests may be advised in some situations - for example, if you have a kidney stone or if a kidney abnormality is suspected. Tests are also usually advised if you are a man, or if you have recurring kidney infections. If further tests are needed, an ultrasound scan is often the first one which is done. Sometimes a CT scan may also be done.
How to treat a kidney infection
Antibiotics will usually clear the infection. Commonly used antibiotics for kidney infections include cefalexin, co-amoxiclav or trimethoprim.

Painkillers such as paracetamol can ease pain and reduce a high temperature (fever). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen are not usually recommended for a person with a kidney infection. This is because they may possibly cause problems with the working of the kidney during a kidney infection.

In many cases, the kidney infection is not too severe, treatment can be taken at home and the infection will clear with a course of antibiotic tablets. If treatment is to be home-based, a doctor should be called if the symptoms are not improving after 24 hours, or the person is feeling more unwell.
However, some people need to be admitted to hospital - for example if:

Complications of a kidney infection
Most people who develop a kidney infection make a full recovery if treatment is given promptly. Possible complications which occur in a small number of cases include:
Sometimes germs (bacteria) from a kidney infection get into the bloodstream, particularly if treatment is delayed. This may cause blood poisoning (sepsis). This can be serious or even life-threatening.

Understanding the kidneys and urinary tract
There are two kidneys, one on each side of the tummy (abdomen), towards the back. They make urine which drains down the tubes between the bladder and kidney (ureters) into the bladder. Urine is stored in the bladder and is passed out through the tube from the bladder (the urethra) from time to time when we go to the toilet.

Polycystic kidney disease
Chronic kidney disease means that the kidneys are not working as well as would be expected. Various conditions can cause chronic kidney disease. Severity can vary but most cases are mild or moderate, occur in older people and do not cause symptoms. Chronic kidney disease tends to become worse gradually over months or years.

What is chronic kidney disease?
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means that the kidneys are not working as well as they used to, either due to being diseased or damaged in some way, or due to ageing. A range of conditions can cause chronic kidney disease (see later).
Chronic means ongoing, persistent and long-term.
Chronic kidney disease used to be called chronic renal failure but chronic kidney disease is now considered a better term. The word "failure" implies that the kidneys have stopped working but in most cases of chronic kidney disease this is not the case - they are not working as well as would be expected.
In most people who have chronic kidney disease there is only a mild or moderate drop in kidney function.
Acute kidney injury (AKI)
An acute kidney injury occurs when the function of the kidneys is rapidly affected - over hours or days. For example, the kidneys may go into acute kidney injury if there is a serious blood infection which can affect the kidneys.
This is in contrast to chronic kidney disease where the decline in function of the kidneys is gradual - over months or years.
For more information, see the separate leaflet called What do kidneys do?
Kidney and urinary tract
I was amazed to discover from a recent survey that 50% of Britons don't know that their kidneys make urine. They play an essential role in filtering out waste our bodies produce - which is exactly why we need to look after them.

Kidney and urinary tract
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common long-term condition where the kidneys aren't working as well as they should be. There are some dietary choices that are recommended for people with early CKD. People with more advanced CKD may be advised to follow a special diet, usually with the support of a specialist dietician.
by Dr Doug McKechnie, MRCGP
What causes chronic kidney disease?
A number of conditions can cause long-term damage to the kidneys and affect their function, leading to chronic kidney disease. The three most common causes in the UK are:
Diabetes. Diabetic kidney disease is a common complication of diabetes.
Diabetes. Diabetic kidney disease is a common complication of diabetes.
High blood pressure. Untreated or poorly treated high blood pressure is a major cause of CKD. However, CKD can also cause high blood pressure as the kidney has a role in blood pressure regulation. About nine out of ten people with CKD stages 3-5 have high blood pressure.

Ageing kidneys. There is often an age-related decline in kidney function. About half of people aged over 75 have some degree of CKD. In most of these cases, the CKD does not progress beyond the moderate stage unless other problems of the kidney, such as diabetic kidney disease, develop.
Ageing kidneys. There is often an age-related decline in kidney function. About half of people aged over 75 have some degree of CKD. In most of these cases, the CKD does not progress beyond the moderate stage unless other problems of the kidney, such as diabetic kidney disease, develop.
These conditions account for three in four cases of chronic kidney disease in adults.
Other less common conditions that can cause chronic kidney disease include:
Certain medications, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (if they are used long-term, especially at high doses), lithium, ciclosporin and tacrolimus. People taking one of these medicines should have a blood test to check kidney function at least once a year.

What are chronic kidney disease symptoms?
There are usually no symptoms with mild-to-moderate chronic kidney disease - that is, stages 1 to 3. Chronic kidney disease is usually diagnosed by a blood test before any symptoms develop.
Symptoms tend to develop when chronic kidney disease becomes severe (stage 4) or worse. The symptoms at first tend to be vague and nonspecific, such as feeling tired, having less energy than usual or just not feeling well. With more severe chronic kidney disease, symptoms that may develop include:
Difficulty thinking clearly.

If the kidney function declines to stage 4 or 5 then various other problems may develop - for example, anaemia or an imbalance of calcium, phosphate and other chemicals in the bloodstream. These can cause various symptoms, such as tiredness due to anaemia, and bone thinning (osteoporosis) or fractures due to calcium and phosphate imbalance. End-stage kidney failure (stage 5) is eventually fatal unless treated.
What are the stages of chronic kidney disease?
Chronic kidney disease is diagnosed by blood tests including an eGFR test and is divided into five stages:
Stage of Chronic Kidney Disease
eGFR ml/min/1.73 m
Stage 1: the eGFR shows normal kidney function
but you are already known to have some kidney damage or disease. For example, you may have some protein or blood in your urine, an abnormality of your kidney, kidney inflammation, etc.
90 or more
Stage 2: mildly reduced kidney function AND you are already known to have some kidney damage or disease. People with an eGFR of 60-89 without any known kidney damage or disease are not considered to have chronic kidney disease (CKD).
60 to 89
Stage 3: moderately reduced kidney function. (With or without a known kidney disease. For example, an elderly person with ageing kidneys may have reduced kidney function without a specific known kidney disease.)
45 to 59 (3A)
30 to 44 (3B)
Stage 4: severely reduced kidney function. (With or without known kidney disease.)
15 to 29
Stage 5: very severely reduced kidney function. This is sometimes called end-stage kidney failure or established renal failure.
Less than 15
Note: it is normal for the eGFR to change slightly from one measurement to the next. In some cases these changes may actually be large enough to move from one stage of chronic kidney disease to another and then back again. These normal fluctuations are acceptable as long as the eGFR is not progressively getting worse.
What if I have chronic kidney disease stage 3?
Stage 3 means moderate chronic kidney disease. People with stage 3 CKD do not usually need to see a kidney specialist (a nephrologist) but will need annual blood and urine tests at their GP practice.
Treatment will often be advised to reduce the risk of progressing to more severe chronic kidney disease. This includes managing the blood pressure aggressively to reduce it to below recommended levels. It also includes aggressively managing any other conditions such as diabetes. Other treatments might be suggested to reduce the risk of any other problems, particularly cardiovascular diseases (CVDs - see below).
Urine tests will look for leakage of protein from the kidneys. People with CKD who leak protein are more likely to develop progressive worsening of their condition. If there is leakage of protein then medications will usually be suggested to reduce this and to slow down the deterioration of the kidney function.
If regular blood and urine tests show that the chronic kidney disease is progressing to stage 4 then referral to a kidney specialist will often be needed.
How is chronic kidney disease diagnosed?
Kidney function is assessed using a combination of:
A blood test called the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); and
A blood test called the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); and
A measure of the amount of protein in the urine (proteinuria).
A measure of the amount of protein in the urine (proteinuria).
Increased protein in the urine and decreased eGFR are both associated with an increased risk of progressive chronic kidney disease.
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
A normal eGFR is 90 ml/minute/1.73 m or more. If some of the glomeruli do not filter as much as normal then the kidney is said to have reduced or impaired kidney function.
The eGFR test involves a blood test which measures a chemical called creatinine. Creatinine is a breakdown product of muscle. Creatinine is normally cleared from the blood by the kidneys. If the kidneys are not working very well and the glomeruli are not filtering as much blood as normal, the level of creatinine in the blood goes up.
The eGFR is calculated from age, sex and blood creatinine level. See the separate leaflets called Routine Kidney Function Blood Test and Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR).
Proteinuria
Proteinuria means that the urine contains an abnormal amount of protein. Most proteins are too big to pass through the kidneys' filters and get into the urine. However, tiny amounts of a small protein called albumin is leaked into the urine.
If a kidney is damaged then increased amounts of albumin and other larger proteins from the blood can pass into the urine. This abnormal amount of protein in the urine is known as proteinuria. The amount of proteinuria is a good indicator of the extent of kidney damage. Proteinuria is also associated with an increased risk of the development of heart and blood vessel disease.
The amount of proteinuria is measured by a sample of urine sent to the laboratory to measure the ratio of the level of either albumin or total protein in the urine compared with the amount of creatinine in the urine.
Excess protein in the urine is called microalbuminuria.
How common is chronic kidney disease?
About 1 in 10 people have some degree of chronic kidney disease. It can develop at any age and various conditions can lead to CKD. It becomes more common with increasing age and is more common in women.
Although about half of people aged 75 or more have some degree of chronic kidney disease; most of these people do not actually have diseases of their kidneys but have normal ageing of their kidneys.
Most cases of CKD are mild or moderate (stages 1-3).
Do I need any further tests?
As mentioned, the eGFR test is done to diagnose and monitor the progression and severity of chronic kidney disease. For example, it should be done once a year in people with stages 1 and 2 CKD, and more frequently in some people with stage 3 and in everyone with stage 4 or 5 CKD.
Annual urine tests are needed to check for protein in the urine. Other blood tests may be done from time to time to check on your blood level of chemicals such as sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphate.
The need for other tests then depends on various factors. For example:
An ultrasound scan of the kidneys or a kidney biopsy may be advised if certain kidney conditions are suspected.
An ultrasound scan of the kidneys or a kidney biopsy may be advised if certain kidney conditions are suspected.
A scan or having a sample taken (a biopsy) is not needed in most cases. This is because most people with chronic kidney disease have a known cause for the impaired kidney function, such as a complication of diabetes, high blood pressure or ageing.

If the chronic kidney disease progresses to stage 3 or worse then various other tests may be done. For example, blood tests might be required to check for anaemia and an altered level of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH is involved in the control of the blood level of calcium and phosphate.

Chronic kidney disease treatment
Management of most cases of chronic kidney disease takes place in general practice. This is because most cases are mild-to-moderate (stages 1-3) and do not need more specialist treatment.
Referral will usually be needed at stages 4 or 5 CKD, at earlier stages in younger adults with no obvious risk factors or if there are other symptoms that might need further investigation.
Research studies have shown that, in many people, treatment at early stages of chronic kidney disease can prevent or slow down progression of the disease.

Preventing or slowing down the progression of chronic kidney disease
There are ways to stop chronic kidney disease becoming any worse or to slow down any progression.
These usually include:
Blood pressure control. The most important treatment to prevent or delay the progression of chronic kidney disease, whatever the underlying cause, is to keep blood pressure very well controlled. Most people with CKD will require medication to control their blood pressure. Depending on the amount of albumin in the urine, a target blood pressure level of below 130/80 mm Hg or even lower will be advised. For children and young people with CKD and high levels of albumin in the urine, blood pressure should be kept less than average for their height.

Review of medication. Certain medicines can affect the kidneys as a side-effect which can make CKD worse. For example, people with CKD should not take anti-inflammatory medicines unless advised to by a doctor. The dose of certain medicines may also need to be adjusted if CKD gets worse.

Medication to protect your kidneys
ACE inhibitors and ARBs. If there are high levels of protein in the urine then medication usually used to reduce blood pressure will be advised, even with normal blood pressure levels. Two related types of medication have been shown to be beneficial for many people with CKD. This is because they can prevent further worsening of the kidney function. These medicines are called:
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example, captopril, enalapril, ramipril, lisinopril); and
Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), such as losartan, valsartan, candesartan, telmisartan).

SGLT2 inhibitors. A group of medicines called the SGLT2 inhibitors (such as canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and ertugliflozin) were originally used to keep blood sugar under control in type 2 diabetes. However, more recent studies show that some of them can significantly reduce decline in kidney function. Guidance now suggests that dapagliflozin should be considered and would be recommended for most people with CKD and high levels of protein in their urine. However, dapagliflozin is not advised for people with stage 5 CKD (and only on the advice of a specialist in people with stage 4 CKD).

However, more recent studies show that some of them can significantly reduce decline in kidney function. Guidance now suggests that dapagliflozin should be considered and would be recommended for most people with CKD and high levels of protein in their urine. However, dapagliflozin is not advised for people with stage 5 CKD (and only on the advice of a specialist in people with stage 4 CKD).
Dr Krishna Vakharia, 29th January 2024
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has now recommended empagliflozin as an option for treating CKD in adults. It can only be used in addition to the highest dose of ACE inhibitors or ARBs (unless you cannot have these medications). They can also only be used under certain criteria. If this medication is right for you, your doctor will discuss it with you.
Treating end-stage kidney failure
Only a small number of people with chronic kidney disease progress to end-stage kidney failure (stage 5 CKD) that requires kidney dialysis or kidney transplant. People with stage 4 or 5 CKD are likely to be referred to a kidney specialist (nephrologist) at a hospital.
Regular follow-up will be needed - how often depends on how severe the CKD is and how quickly it is getting worse. As well as monitoring the kidney function, the nephrology team is likely to carry out certain blood tests:
Full blood count (for anaemia).

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says that patients receiving dialysis should be offered the choice of having their treatment at home or in a hospital or clinic. It advises that patients, in discussion with doctors, should be able to decide which type of dialysis is right for them and where they will receive it, depending on local arrangements.
Reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases
People with chronic kidney disease have an increased risk of developing chronic vascular diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease.
People with CKD are twenty times more likely to die from cardiovascular-related problems than from kidney failure. This is why reducing any other cardiovascular risk factors is so important. See the separate leaflet called Cardiovascular Disease (Atheroma).
This typically includes:
Excellent control of blood pressure.

Relieving symptoms and problems caused by chronic kidney disease
If chronic kidney disease becomes severe, treatment might be needed to combat various problems caused by the poor kidney function. For example:
Anaemia may develop which may need treatment with iron or erythropoietin - a hormone normally made by the kidneys. A new medication called roxadustat has also been approved by NICE - this can be used for people with stage 3-5 CKD who have symptomatic anaemia but who do not have iron deficiency and who are not on dialysis.

If end-stage kidney failure develops, kidney dialysis or a kidney transplant are likely to be needed to survive.
People with stage 3 CKD or worse should be immunised against influenza each year, and have a one-off immunisation against pneumococcus. People with stage 4 CKD should also be immunised against hepatitis B.
What is the outlook for chronic kidney disease?
Stage 1-3 chronic kidney disease (mild-to-moderate) is common, with most cases occurring in older people. It tends to become gradually worse over months or years. However, the rate of progression varies from case to case and often depends on the severity of any underlying condition.
For many people with CKD there is a much higher risk of developing serious CVD than of developing end-stage kidney failure.
The most important things that can affect the outlook (prognosis) are:
Excellent blood pressure control.

Kidney stones are hard stones that can cause severe pain in your side along with blood in your urine, and nausea and vomiting. You are more likely to develop kidney stones if you eat a Western diet, don't drink enough fluids or are overweight. Once you have had one episode they are likely to recur but there are several kidney stone treatment options available.

Our kidneys remove many different chemicals from our body. This is really important to keep us healthy. These chemicals are passed from our kidneys to our bladder and out of our body. Occasionally these chemicals can join together and form kidney stones.
How common are kidney stones?
Kidney stones are common and occur in up to 1 in 7 people.

What causes kidney stones?
Diagram with kidney cross-section
The kidneys filter the blood and remove excess water and waste chemicals to produce urine. Urine travels from each kidney down the tube (the ureter) draining urine from the kidney into the bladder. This is called the urinary tract.
Many waste chemicals are dissolved in the urine. The chemicals sometimes form tiny crystals in the urine which clump together to form a small stone. Most kidney stones are small and pass out with the urine. Some stones become stuck in a kidney or in the ureter.
In most cases, there is no known reason why a stone is formed. Most stones are made of calcium. However, in most cases, the amount of calcium and other chemicals in the urine and blood is normal.
Kidney stone symptoms
For some people, a kidney stone may just stay in a kidney and cause no symptoms. Other kidney stones may travel out of your body in your urine without you knowing anything about it. If kidney stone symptoms do occur, they include:
Pain from a kidney. A stone that is stuck in a kidney may cause pain in the side of your abdomen (loin). This pain can be very severe and cause you to feel sweaty and be sick (vomit).

Renal colic:
Renal colic:
This is a severe pain which is caused by a stone that passes into the tube (the ureter) draining urine from the kidney.
The stone becomes stuck. The ureter squeezes the stone towards the bladder, which causes intense pain in the side of your tummy (abdomen).
The pain caused by renal colic may last from a few minutes to a few hours. The pain comes in spasms and between these spasms there may be intervals of no pain or just a dull ache.
The pain may spread down into the lower abdomen or groin. You may sweat, feel sick or even vomit because the pain can be very bad.

What makes kidney stones more likely?
You are more likely to form a kidney stone if your urine is concentrated. For example, if you exercise vigorously, if you live in a hot climate or if you work in a hot environment when you may lose more fluid as sweat and less as urine.
You are also more prone to develop kidney stones if you have:

Underlying causes are uncommon
In a small number of cases, a medical condition causes the kidney stone. Various uncommon conditions can lead to high levels of chemicals in the body, such as calcium, oxalate, uric acid and cystine. If the level of these chemicals is high enough in the urine, they can form into stones.
Do some medicines make kidney stones more likely?
Taking certain medicines can make you more prone to making kidney stones. Examples include:
'Water' tablets (diuretics).

Some chemotherapy medicines for cancer.

Some medicines used to treat HIV.
Some medicines used to treat HIV.
However, many people safely take these medicines without developing kidney stones. If you think that a medicine you are taking is the cause of your kidney stone, you should not stop taking the medicine but discuss it with your doctor.
Diagnosing kidney stones
Your doctor may arrange some initial urine and blood tests if you display kidney stone symptoms:
A blood test to check that the kidneys are working properly.
A blood test to check that the kidneys are working properly.
You may also have other blood tests to check the level of certain chemicals that may cause kidney stones if the level is high. Examples include calcium and uric acid.

Urine tests to check for infection and for certain crystals.
Urine tests to check for infection and for certain crystals.
If you have kidney stone symptoms, special X-rays or scans of the kidneys and the tubes (the ureters) draining urine from the kidneys may be done. These tests may start with an X-ray and ultrasound scan. A CT scan may also be needed. These tests are used to detect a stone, to find out exactly where it is and to check that a stone is not blocking the flow of urine.
What can be done to rule out or confirm an underlying cause?
Kidney stones are common and they are not caused by any known underlying disease for most people. However, some tests may be recommended to rule out an underlying problem. In particular, tests are more likely to be advised if:
You have repeated (recurring) kidney stones.

You may be asked to catch a stone so that it can be analysed. This will help to find out if there may be an underlying cause for the kidney stone. To catch a stone, you will need to pass urine through gauze, a tea strainer or a filter such as a coffee filter.
Kidney stone treatment
Most stones that cause renal colic are small and pass out with the urine in a day or so. You should drink plenty of fluids to encourage a good flow of urine. Strong painkillers are often needed to ease the pain until you pass the stone. No other treatment is usually needed.
Some stones become stuck in a kidney or in one of the tubes (the ureters) draining urine from a kidney and cause persistent symptoms or problems. In these cases, the pain usually becomes severe and you may need to be admitted to hospital. There are various kidney stone treatment options, including:
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) uses high-energy shock waves which are focused on to the stones from a machine outside the body to break up stones. You then pass out the tiny broken fragments when you pass urine.

Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is used for stones not suitable for ESWL. A thin telescope-like instrument (a nephroscope) is passed through the skin and into the kidney. The stone is broken up and the fragments of stone are removed via the nephroscope. This procedure is usually done under general anaesthetic.

Another option for a purely uric acid stone (about 1 in 20 stones) is to dissolve the stone. This can be done by drinking plenty of fluids and making the urine alkaline with medication.
How to prevent kidney stones
There are various kidney stone treatment options available, but about half of people who have a kidney stone develop another one at a later time in their lives. Drinking plenty of water each day may help in preventing kidney stones in future.
For the few people who have a high level of certain chemicals in the body, further advice and treatment to reduce the amount of these chemicals may be needed.
Kidney stone complications
Complications from kidney stones are uncommon. Rarely, a large stone can completely block the flow of urine passing down one of the tubes (ureters) draining urine from the kidney. This may lead to infection or even damage to the kidney (acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease).
This is now very uncommon because X-rays or scans will usually detect any blockage so that large stones can be removed before they cause any damage to your kidneys.

Women are generally at much higher risk of developing a urinary tract infection (UTI) than men, and UTIs are also more common in older adults. If a UTI is limited to the bladder, it can be painful but is almost always not serious. However, if a UTI spreads up the urinary system to the kidneys and causes a kidney infection (called pyelonephritis) then this can make you very unwell and can be serious.

What is a UTI?
A UTI is an infection in any part of the urinary system. The urinary system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract (the bladder and the urethra). Risk factors for UTI include previous UTIs, previous surgery for the urinary tract, an enlarged prostate in men, and diabetes. Having a catheter will also increase the risk of UTI.

How do you get a UTI?
You most often get a UTI when bacteria that originate from the bowel get into the bladder. A germ (bacterium) called Escherichia coli (E. coli) is responsible for up to 9 in 10 of all UTIs. UTIs can also come from other bacteria like streptococci, klebsiella, and Proteus mirabilis, and sometimes even fungi.
Less often, bacteria causing the UTI can enter the bladder when a catheter is inserted into the bladder, or directly from the bloodstream.
An untreated lower UTI will usually get better within a few days but, less often, the infection may spread to the upper urinary tract if bacteria travel up your ureters and reach the kidneys. This type of UTI can lead to permanent kidney damage or even a life-threatening condition called sepsis.
What are the symptoms of a UTI?
A lower UTI most often causes pain when passing urine (dysuria), passing urine more often (frequency), and, less often, there may be blood in the urine.
See also the leaflets on Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Women (LUTS) and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Men.
Upper UTI symptoms may include fever, chills, pain in your side (loin), back, or groin, vomiting, and nausea.
How long does a UTI last?
If you've got a UTI just in your bladder, the infection can last from a few days to one week. But if you have a kidney infection, it will usually last longer and may take several weeks to get better.
How to treat a UTI
To help ease symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI)
Take paracetamol to reduce pain and also to bring down your temperature if you have a fever. Paracetamol is a better choice than a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen or aspirin.

Some people take cystitis sachets or cranberry drinks and products every day to prevent UTIs from happening, which may help. But there's no evidence they help ease symptoms or treat a UTI if the infection has already started.

Treatment from a GP or nurse
If a GP or other healthcare professional thinks you may have a urinary tract infection (UTI), they may do a urine test, although this is not always needed. A simple urine dipstick test may show white blood cells, nitrite and, sometimes, blood that indicate the urine is infected. The sample may be sent to the laboratory to be further tested to identify the bacteria causing the infection and the best antibiotics to treat the infection.
A GP or nurse may also:

Giving you a prescription for antibiotics, but suggest you wait for 48 hours before taking them in case your symptoms go away on their own.
If you are treated with antibiotics, sometimes the UTI may be antibiotic-resistant to the first antibiotic prescribed and the choice may then be to watch and wait to see if the infection clears, or to try a different antibiotic. This is where sending urine tests to the laboratory can be really helpful to identify the bacteria and to ensure that the best antibiotics can be prescribed to treat that infection.
Treatment from a GP for UTIs that keep coming back
If your UTI comes back after treatment, or you have two UTIs in the previous six months or three within the previous 12 months (called recurrent UTIs), a GP may:
