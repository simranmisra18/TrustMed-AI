Travel vaccinations are an essential part of holiday and travel planning, particularly if your journey takes you to an exotic destination or 'off the beaten track'. The risks are not restricted to tropical travel, although most travel vaccines are targeted at diseases which are more common in the tropics.
For more general information about travel see the separate leaflet called Health Advice for Travel Abroad.
This leaflet discusses the vaccinations that are available and gives some idea of the time you need to allow to complete a full protective course of vaccination. Further information specific to your destination can be obtained from your surgery (if they have the resources to offer this service), from specialist travel clinics and from a number of websites. You will find a selection of these listed at the bottom of this leaflet and under references.

Why do I need travel vaccinations?
The rise in worldwide and adventurous tourism has seen a massive increase in people travelling to exotic destinations. This leads to exposure to diseases that are less likely to occur at home. These are diseases against which we have no natural immunity and against which we are not routinely immunised in the UK. They include:
Insect-borne conditions such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever and Zika virus.
Insect-borne conditions such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever and Zika virus.
Diseases acquired from eating and drinking, such as hepatitis A and traveller's diarrhoea.
Diseases acquired from eating and drinking, such as hepatitis A and traveller's diarrhoea.
Diseases acquired from others or conditions of poor hygiene, such as hepatitis B and Ebola virus.

These are illnesses which might not only spoil your holiday but might also pose a risk to your life. For specific advice on travelling to more remote places: see the separate leaflet called Travelling to Remote Locations.
Travel and vaccinations
Yellow fever is endemic to many countries in Latin America and Africa and can often be fatal. Vaccination is currently the best protection against this deadly disease - but what are the risks?
by Léa Surugue
Travel and vaccinations
Rabies is a very serious viral infection, which almost always causes death. It is passed to humans from bites or scratches from infected animals that carry the rabies virus - most commonly dogs but also other animals, including bats. There is no cure for rabies but there is a vaccine to prevent it. This can be given to people who are at risk of rabies.
by Dr Toni Hazell, MRCGP
What travel vaccinations do I need?
Before travelling outside the UK it is important to check whether there are any vaccinations available which could protect you. You can do this by making a travel planning appointment at your GP surgery. During your consultation a specialist travel nurse will complete a risk assessment to determine which vaccines are right for you. If your GP does not offer this service, or does not have an appointment available before you travel, then you will need to seek this advice from a private travel clinic.
There are also several websites which aim to offer up-to-date, country-specific advice on vaccinations and on disease patterns.
You can find out if travel vaccines are recommended for any countries you are planning to visit from the Travel Health Pro website or NHS website Fitfortravel if you are in Scotland.
Vaccination courses need to be planned well in advance. Some vaccinations involve a course of injections at specified intervals and it can take up to six months to complete a course. Some vaccinations can't be given together.
The following table lists the travel vaccinations which are available and in common use in the UK. Always check with your surgery or online before travelling, particularly to unusual destinations, for local outbreaks of disease which mean other specific vaccinations are advised.
Travel vaccinations (adults)

Some countries require a certificate of vaccination before allowing entry (in some cases, if travelling from an affected area; in other cases, for entry from anywhere).
First dose:
Day 0
The protection offered by vaccination is not always 100%. Vaccination will greatly reduce your chances of acquiring the disease and in many cases the protection level offered is extremely high. The protection will also not be lifelong. However, there isn't a vaccine available for every disease - for example, there is none at present against malaria.
Even where a vaccine is available, vaccination should not be the only thing you rely on for protection against illness. It is important to know the risks; taking sensible steps to avoid exposing yourself to disease is by far the most useful thing you can do.
Pregnant women
It is important that pregnant women also receive the necessary vaccinations before travelling. Some vaccines, however, are not safe to use in pregnancy - see table below. In some cases your doctor or nurse may ask you to consider whether the journey could wait until after the birth of your baby, as the risks of disease may be very real and you may be unable to fully protect yourself and your baby.
There is currently no vaccine or medicine to prevent Zika virus, which is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and which is of particular concern to pregnant women due to its link to birth defects. The recent outbreak of the virus is currently considered a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. See the separate leaflet called Zika Virus.

Malaria prevention
No vaccination is available against malaria. People who live permanently in malarial zones have partial protection but they lose this swiftly when they move away. Protection against malaria is through a combination of avoidance of mosquito bites and the use of malaria tablets.
Tablets have to be started before entering the malarial zone and continued for some days or weeks after leaving it. The recommended tablet regime varies by area. Your practice nurse will have access to up-to-date advice on recommendations for your journey. See the separate leaflet called Malaria Prevention for more details.
Diseases for which no vaccine is yet available
There are many tropical diseases for which no vaccination is yet available. These include:
Insect (arthropod)-borne viruses such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya.
Insect (arthropod)-borne viruses such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya.

Who should be vaccinated?
People often at greatest risk when travelling are those visiting a country which they think of as their place of origin, where members of their family live and roots may be. People often believe - falsely - that as one-time residents who may have been born and raised there, they have a natural immunity. They feel that they are not on holiday but visiting home and that vaccinations aren't needed.
Unfortunately this is not true. We acquire natural immunity by living in a place and being constantly exposed to the diseases that are present. When we leave the area for distant shores that protection is rapidly lost and we need the protection of vaccination, together with the other precautions listed above.
This is particularly true of malaria, where visitors 'going back home' may find their relatives puzzled and even amused that they are taking anti-malarial medication. Even so, it's very important to do so. It's only by living there all the time that you acquire your resident relatives' level of immunity. Your immune system has a short memory for this sort of partial immunity.
Where can I get travel vaccinations?
Many NHS surgeries offer a full range of travel vaccinations. However, your surgery may not have the resources to fit you in before you travel. Alternatively, you can visit private specialist travel clinics.
Free travel vaccinations
The NHS does not usually cover travellers for vaccinations relating to exotic travel, although some vaccinations such as hepatitis A are usually free. Aid workers and healthcare workers are often offered free vaccinations against occupational risks but others have to pay.
Anti-malarial tablets are never free and can add a substantial sum to the cost of your trip. Whilst this may seem expensive, it is usually a small sum relative to the costs of your travel. Safeguarding your health should be considered an essential part of any trip.
If a vaccination certificate is issued keep it and update it over the years so that you have a full record. Your NHS surgery will have a record of vaccines they have administered to you and can often issue a copy. However, the yellow fever vaccination certificate needs to be saved, as this cannot be re-issued.

Aeroplane ear, or the feeling of blocked or painful ears while flying, is caused by pressure changes. Usually your ears will settle soon after landing. Occasionally pain or a feeling of blockage drags on; if it does, see your doctor.

What is aeroplane ear?
Aeroplane ear refers to the pain and discomfort that some people experience when flying on an aeroplane. It occurs when the air pressure in your middle ear and the air pressure in the environment are out of balance.
This happens as the plane descends to land. The pain may get worse the lower the plane gets and can be quite severe on landing. The pain usually goes away soon after landing.
It's all due to pressure changes. As the plane starts to lose height, the pressure in the air around you changes. Until the pressure inside the tubes behind your eardrum adapts, the pressure inside and outside your ear is different. This pushes the eardrum in, stretching it and giving you pain.
Aeroplane ear is a mild and temporary form of ear barotrauma.
Does aeroplane ear happen to everyone?
The pressure change is happening to everyone, but in some people the pain or blockage is worse than others - some may not feel it at all. In particular, if you are congested (because of a cold or allergies such as hay fever), it is harder for your ears to adapt. If this is the case, you may be more aware of pain or blocked ears than the person sitting next to you.
What causes aeroplane ear?
The pain is caused by unequal pressure that develops between the air in the middle ear and the air outside the ear during takeoff and landing.
Ear cross-section diagram: pressure build-up during flying
The small space in the middle ear behind the eardrum is normally filled with air. This air space is connected to the back of the nose by a tiny channel called the Eustachian tube. The air on either side of the eardrum should be at the same pressure.
Air pressure is highest nearer the ground. So as a plane descends, the air pressure becomes higher. This pushes the eardrum inwards which can be painful. To relieve this, the pressure in the middle ear has to rise quickly too. Air needs to travel up the Eustachian tube into the middle ear to equalise the pressure.
What is the treatment for aeroplane ear?
Ideally, anyone with an ear infection, cold or respiratory infection, etc, should not fly. However, some people may feel that they need to fly anyway as the reason for the trip is so important.
The following may help people who develop ear pain when flying.
Suck sweets or chew chewing gum
Do this when the plane begins to descend. Air is more likely to flow up the Eustachian tube if you swallow, yawn or chew. For babies, it is a good idea to feed them or give them a drink or dummy at the time of descent to encourage them to swallow.
Valsalva manoeuvre
Try doing the following: take a breath in. Then, try to breathe out gently with your mouth closed and whilst pinching your nostrils shut (the Valsalva manoeuvre). In this way, no air is blown out but you are gently pushing air into the Eustachian tube.
If you do this you may feel your ears go 'pop' as air is pushed into the middle ear. This often cures the problem. Repeat this every few minutes until landing - whenever you feel any ear discomfort.
Stay awake when the plane is descending to land
Ask the air steward or stewardess to wake you when the plane starts to descend. If you are awake you can make sure that you suck and swallow to encourage air to get into the middle ear.
The above usually works for most people. However, if you are particularly prone to develop aeroplane ear, you may wish also to consider the following in addition to the tips above:
Antihistamine tablets (available at pharmacies). Take the recommended dose the day before and the day of travel. This may help to limit the amount of mucus that you make.
Antihistamine tablets (available at pharmacies). Take the recommended dose the day before and the day of travel. This may help to limit the amount of mucus that you make.
Decongestant tablets or syrup. For example, a medication called pseudoephedrine. This can be obtained from a pharmacy, without a prescription. Take the dose recommended half an hour before take-off, and if necessary repeat according to the instructions.

Blowing up a special balloon. Products such as Otovent® are balloons which you blow up through your nose, by blocking off one nostril at a time and blowing through the other. These can be bought from pharmacies, and some people find they help stop the pain during flying or unblock ears afterwards.

Take paracetamol
If the measures above fail to help, although the pain may be severe, it normally goes quickly. If it does not settle, take painkillers such as paracetamol until it does go.
You should see a doctor if the pain or dulled hearing does not clear within a few days.
How can I help my child?
Kids are also going to get these pressure changes in their ears, and there is invariably a baby bawling as the plane starts to descend and they notice their ears start to hurt.
You can help babies and young children by:
Feeding your baby with a bottle
This as the sucking and swallowing action will help equalise the pressures for them.
Encouraging them to suck a dummy
Sucking on a dummy (pacifier) may have the same effect as feeding a baby.
Give them a sweet to suck
Avoid boiled sweets in very young children because of the choking risk, but in older kids this may be a remedy which will make you a popular parent.
Have them drink from a straw sports bottle
A drink which has a straw or which is in a sports bottle might also be useful as it encourages the sucking action as with the other methods.
Give them paracetamol or ibuprofen
If your child has a cold and is therefore likely to have more of a problem on the flight, a dose of paracetamol or ibuprofen an hour before landing might make for a more peaceful flight.
Some of the measures described above may be helpful, but decongestants are not generally recommended for children.
Are there any complications of aeroplane ear?
Complications are extremely unusual, or millions of people wouldn't be flying on a regular basis. Very occasionally, the eardrum can be put under so much pressure that it bursts (perforates), leaving a hole in the eardrum. If this does happen, the pain usually goes away immediately. Perforated eardrums usually heal well without any treatment.
Can I fly with an ear infection?
It is advisable NOT to fly if you have an ear infection, such as otitis media or otitis externa If you do fly, the pain in your ear may be worse and it may take longer to settle. You may be more likely to have a perforated eardrum.
If you absolutely do have to fly with an ear infection and cannot delay your travel or go by an alternative mode of transport, decongestant medicines may help prevent problems. (These are not suitable for children under the age of 6 years, and only with the advice of a pharmacist for children aged 6-12 years.) It may also be worth taking regular painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen during the flight.

Motion sickness (travel sickness) is common, especially in children. It is caused by repeated movements during travelling which send strong (sometimes confusing) signals to the balance and position sensors in the brain.

What is disembarkation syndrome?
What is motion sickness?
Symptoms of nausea, dizziness or vomiting, caused by travel in a vehicle, boat or aeroplane, is known as motion sickness. It can also be caused by playing video games or walking or standing on moving platforms, for example a pontoon on a lake.
What causes motion sickness?
Motion sickness is a response to repeated movements, such as going over bumps or around in a circle, which send lots of messages to the brain.
If sitting inside a vehicle or on a boat, particularly when focusing on things that are also inside the vehicle (such as a book or screen), then the eyes are sending signals to the brain that the person's position is not changing, whilst the balance mechanisms are sending signals to the brain that the person's position is constantly changing.
On a fairground ride when being spun in different directions, the eyes, the muscles and the balance sensors are all sending different messages to the brain at once.
These conflicting messages cause people to experience motion sickness.
Is motion sickness normal?
Motion sickness is very common and is a normal response that anyone can have when experiencing real or perceived motion. Everyone can develop motion sickness if exposed to sufficiently intense motion but some people are very rarely affected while other people are more susceptible and have to deal with motion sickness very often.
Triggers for motion sickness
Motion sickness is more common in children and in women. Most children grow out of having motion sickness. It is not known why some people develop motion sickness more than others.
Symptoms can develop in cars, trains, planes and boats and on amusement park rides, etc. Sometimes trying to read a book or a map whilst travelling can trigger motion sickness. Strong smells whilst travelling can also trigger motion sickness.
Playing computer games can sometimes cause motion sickness to occur.
Motion sickness symptoms
There are various symptoms of motion sickness including:

How long does motion sickness last?
Symptoms typically go when the journey is over; however, in some people they can last for a few hours, or even days, after the journey ends.
How to stop motion sickness
Some general tips to avoid motion sickness include the following:
Prepare for the journey
Don't eat a heavy meal before travelling. Light, carbohydrate-based food like cereal, pasta or toast an hour or two before travelling is best.

Plan where to sit
Keep motion to a minimum. For example, try to sit in the front seat of a car, over the wing of a plane, or on deck in the middle of a boat.

It is advisable not to watch moving objects such as waves or other cars. Don't look at things your brain expects to stay still, like a book inside the car. Instead, look ahead, a little above the horizon, at a fixed place.

If you are the driver you are less likely to feel motion sickness. This is probably because you are constantly focused on the road ahead and attuned to the movements that you expect the vehicle to make. If you are not the driver, then sitting in the front and watching what the driver is watching can be helpful.

Treat your tummy gently
Avoid heavy meals and do not drink alcohol before and during travelling. It may also be worth avoiding spicy or fatty food.

Natural treatments for motion sickness
All the techniques above which aim to prevent motion sickness will also help reduce it once it has begun. Other techniques, which are useful on their own to treat motion sickness but can also be used with medicines if required, are:
Breathe deeply and slowly and, while focusing on breathing, listening to music. This has been proved to be effective in clinical trials.

There are several motion sickness medicines available which can reduce, or prevent, symptoms of motion sickness. They can be bought from pharmacies. They work by interfering with the nerve signals described above.
Medicines are best taken before the journey. They may still help even if taken after symptoms have begun, although medicines are absorbed less well once nausea has started. Therefore, skin patches or medications absorbed through the gums are more effective after nausea has already developed.
Hyoscine
Hyoscine is usually the most effective medicine for motion sickness. It is also known as scopolamine. It works by preventing the confusing nerve messages going to the brain.
There are several brands of medicines which contain hyoscine - they also come in a soluble form for children. A dose should be taken 30-60 minutes before a journey; the effect can last up to 72 hours.
Hyoscine also comes as a patch for people aged 10 years or over. (This is only available on prescription - see below.) Side-effects of hyoscine include dry mouth, drowsiness and blurred vision.
Antihistamines
Antihistamines can also be useful, although they are not quite as effective as hyoscine. However, they usually cause fewer side-effects.
Several types of antihistamine are sold for motion sickness. All can cause drowsiness, although some are more prone to cause it than others; for example, promethazine, which may be of use for young children on long journeys, particularly tends to cause drowsiness. Older children or adults may prefer one that is less likely to cause drowsiness - for example, cinnarizine or cyclizine.
Remember, children who have taken medicines which cause drowsiness can sometimes be irritable when the medicines wear off.
See the separate article called How to manage motion sickness.
Side-effects of motion sickness medicines
Some medicines used for motion sickness may cause drowsiness. Some people are extremely sensitive to this and may find that they are so drowsy that they can't function properly at all.
For others the effects may be milder but can still impair reactions and alertness. It is therefore advisable not to drive and not to operate heavy machinery after taking these. In addition, some medicines may interfere with alcohol or other medication; the pharmacist can advise you about this.
What can a doctor prescribe for motion sickness?
There are a number of anti-sickness medicines which can only be prescribed. Not all of them always work well for motion sickness, and finding something that works may be a case of trial and error. They are not usually better than the over-the-counter options. In some areas of the UK, they are not recommended for prescribing.
All of them work best taken up to an hour before the journey, and work less well if used when already feeling sick. See also the separate leaflet called Nausea medicine for more detailed information about these medicines.
Hyoscine patch
Hyoscine, or scopolamine, patches are suitable for adults and for children over 10 years old. The medicine is absorbed through the skin, although this method of medicine delivery is slow so the patch works best if applied well before your journey. The patch needs to be stuck onto the skin behind the ear 5-6 hours before travelling (often this will mean late on the previous night) and removed at the end of the journey. There is no evidence that this works better than any other medications for motion sickness.
Prochlorperazine
Prochlorperazine is a prescription-only medicine which works by changing the actions of the chemicals that control the tendency to be sick (vomit) in the brain.
One form of prochlorperazine is Buccastem®, which is absorbed through your gums and does not need to be swallowed. Buccastem® tastes rather bitter but it can be effective for sickness when already feeling sick as it doesn't have to be absorbed by the stomach.
Metoclopramide
Metoclopramide is a tablet used to speed up the emptying of your tummy. Slow emptying of the tummy is something that happens when you develop nausea and vomiting, so metoclopramide can help prevent this.
It prevents nausea and vomiting quite effectively in some people. It can have unpleasant side-effects, particularly in children (in whom it is not recommended).
Metoclopramide is often helpful for those who tend to have gastric reflux, those who have slow tummy emptying because of previous surgery, and those who have type 1 diabetes.
Ondansetron
Ondansetron is a powerful antisickness medicine which is most commonly used for sickness caused by chemotherapy, and occasionally used for morning sickness in pregnancy. It is not usually effective for motion sickness. This, and its relatively high cost, means that it is not prescribed for motion sickness alone. However, for those undergoing chemotherapy, and for those who have morning sickness aggravated by travel, ondansetron may be helpful.
What should I do if I'm actually sick?
Vomiting may relieve the symptoms of motion sickness a little, although not always for very long. After being sick:
Try a cool flannel on your forehead, try to get some fresh air on your face and do your best to find a way to rinse your mouth to get rid of the taste.
Try a cool flannel on your forehead, try to get some fresh air on your face and do your best to find a way to rinse your mouth to get rid of the taste.
Don't drink anything for ten to twenty minutes (or it may come straight back), although (very) tiny sips of very cold water, coke or ginger ale may help.

What is disembarkation syndrome?
The sensation, also called 'mal de debarquement' (French for sickness on disembarking), refers to the sensation that some people experience after travel on a boat, train or plane, when they continue to feel for some time as though the ground is rocking beneath their feet.
It is probably caused by the overstimulation of the balance organs during the journey. It usually lasts only an hour or two, but in some people it can last for several days, particularly after a long sea journey. It does not usually require any treatment.
Persistent mal de debarquement syndrome is an uncommon condition in which these symptoms may persist for months or years.

Traveller's diarrhoea is diarrhoea that develops during, or shortly after, travel abroad. It is caused by consuming food and water, contaminated by germs (microbes) including bacteria, viruses and parasites. Other symptoms can include high temperature (fever), being sick (vomiting) and tummy (abdominal) pain. In most cases it causes a mild illness and symptoms clear within 3 to 4 days. Specific treatment is not usually needed but it is important to drink plenty of fluids to avoid lack of fluid in the body (dehydration). Always make sure that you get any advice that you need in plenty of time before your journey - some GPs offer travel advice but if yours doesn't then you may need to go to a private travel clinic.

What is traveller's diarrhoea?
Traveller's diarrhoea is diarrhoea that develops during, or shortly after, travel abroad. Diarrhoea is defined as: 'loose or watery stools (faeces), usually at least three times in 24 hours.'
What causes traveller's diarrhoea?
Traveller's diarrhoea is caused by eating food, or drinking water, containing certain germs (microbes) or their poisons (toxins). The types of germs which may be the cause include:
Bacteria: these are the most common microbes that cause traveller's diarrhoea. Common types of bacteria involved are:
Escherichia coli
Campylobacter
Salmonella
Shigella

Parasites: these are less common causes. Giardia, cryptosporidium and Entamoeba histolytica are examples of parasites that may cause traveller's diarrhoea.
Often the exact cause of traveller's diarrhoea is not found and studies have shown that in many people no specific microbe is identified despite testing (for example, of a stool (faeces) specimen).
See the separate leaflets called E. Coli (VTEC O157), Campylobacter, Salmonella, Cryptosporidium, Amoebiasis (dysentery information), Shigella and Giardia for more specific details on each of the microbes mentioned above.
Note: this leaflet is about traveller's diarrhoea in general and how to help prevent it.
Are all travellers at risk?
Traveller's diarrhoea most commonly affects people who are travelling from a developed country, such as the UK, to a developing country where sanitation and hygiene measures may not meet the same standards. It can affect as many as 2 to 6 in 10 travellers.
There is a different risk depending on whether you travel to high-risk areas or not:
High-risk areas: South and Southeast Asia, Central America, West and North Africa, South America, East Africa.
Medium-risk areas: Russia, China, Caribbean, South Africa.
Low-risk areas: North America, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
Sometimes outbreaks of diarrhoea can occur in travellers staying in one hotel or, for example, those staying on a cruise ship. People travelling in more remote areas (for example, trekkers and campers) may also have limited access to medical care if they do become unwell.
What are the symptoms of traveller's diarrhoea?
By definition, diarrhoea is the main symptom. This can be watery and can sometimes contain blood. Other symptoms may include:
Crampy tummy (abdominal) pains.
Crampy tummy (abdominal) pains.
Feeling sick (nausea).

Being sick (vomiting).

A high temperature (fever).
A high temperature (fever).
Symptoms are usually mild in most people and last for 3 to 4 days but they may last longer. Symptoms may be more severe in the very young, the elderly, and those with other health problems. Those whose immune systems are not working as well as normal are particularly likely to be more unwell. For example, people with untreated HIV infection, those on chemotherapy, those on long-term steroid treatment or those who are taking drugs which suppress their immune system, for example after a transplant or to treat an autoimmune condition
Despite the fact that symptoms are usually fairly mild, they can often mean that your travel itinerary is interrupted or may need to be altered.
How is traveller's diarrhoea diagnosed?
Traveller's diarrhoea is usually diagnosed by the typical symptoms. As mentioned above, most people have mild symptoms and do not need to seek medical advice. However, in some cases medical advice is needed (see below).
If you do see a doctor, they may suggest that a sample of your stool (faeces) be tested. This will be sent to the laboratory to look for any microbes that may be causing your symptoms. Sometimes blood tests or other tests may be needed if you have more severe symptoms or develop any complications.
When should I seek medical advice for traveller's diarrhoea?
As mentioned above, most people with traveller's diarrhoea have relatively mild symptoms and can manage these themselves by resting and making sure that they drink plenty of fluids. However, you should seek medical advice in any of the following cases, or if any other symptoms occur that you are concerned about:
If you have a high temperature (fever).

How is traveller's diarrhoea in adults treated?
In most cases, specific treatment of traveller's diarrhoea is not needed. The most important thing is to make sure that you drink plenty of fluids to avoid lack of fluid in your body (dehydration).
Fluid replacement
As a rough guide, drink at least 200 mls after each watery stool (bout of diarrhoea).
As a rough guide, drink at least 200 mls after each watery stool (bout of diarrhoea).
This extra fluid is in addition to what you would normally drink. For example, an adult will normally drink about two litres a day but more in hot countries. The above '200 mls after each watery stool' is in addition to this usual amount that you would drink.

If you are sick (vomit), wait 5-10 minutes and then start drinking again but more slowly. For example, a sip every 2-3 minutes but making sure that your total intake is as described above.

Note: if you suspect that you are becoming dehydrated, you should seek medical advice.
For most adults, fluids drunk to keep hydrated should mainly be water. However, this needs to be safe drinking water - for example, bottled, or boiled and treated water. It is best not to have drinks that contain a lot of sugar, such as fizzy drinks, as they can sometimes make diarrhoea worse. Alcohol should also be avoided.
Rehydration drinks
Rehydration drinks may also be used. They are made from sachets that you can buy from pharmacies and may be a sensible thing to pack in your first aid kit when you travel. You add the contents of the sachet to water.
Home-made salt/sugar mixtures are used in developing countries if rehydration drinks are not available; however, they have to be made carefully, as too much salt can be dangerous. Rehydration drinks are cheap and readily available in the UK, and are the best treatment. Note that safe drinking water should be used to reconstitute oral rehydration salt sachets.
Antidiarrhoeal medication
Antidiarrhoeal medicines are not usually necessary or wise to take when you have traveller's diarrhoea. However you may want to use them if absolutely necessary - for example, if you will be unable to make regular trips to the toilet due to travelling.You can buy antidiarrhoeal medicines from pharmacies before you travel. The safest and most effective is loperamide.
The adult dose of this is two capsules at first. This is followed by one capsule after each time you pass some diarrhoea up to a maximum of eight capsules in 24 hours. It works by slowing down your gut's activity.
You should not take loperamide for longer than two days. You should also not use antidiarrhoeal medicines if you have a high temperature (fever) or bloody diarrhoea.
Eat as normally as possible
It used to be advised to 'starve' for a while if you had diarrhoea. However, now it is advised to eat small, light meals if you can. Be guided by your appetite. You may not feel like food and most adults can do without food for a few days. Eat as soon as you are able but don't stop drinking. If you do feel like eating, avoid fatty, spicy or heavy food. Plain foods such as bread and rice are good foods to try eating.
Antibiotic medicines
Most people with traveller's diarrhoea do not need treatment with antibiotic medicines. However, sometimes antibiotic treatment is advised. This may be because a specific germ (microbe) has been identified after testing of your stool (faeces) sample.
How is traveller's diarrhoea in children treated?
Fluids to prevent dehydration
You should encourage your child to drink plenty of fluids. The aim is to prevent lack of fluid in the body (dehydration). The fluid lost in their sick (vomit) and/or diarrhoea needs to be replaced. Your child should continue with their normal diet and usual drinks. In addition, they should also be encouraged to drink extra fluids. However, avoid fruit juices or fizzy drinks, as these can make diarrhoea worse.
Babies under 6 months old are at increased risk of dehydration. You should seek medical advice if they develop acute diarrhoea. Breast feeds or bottle feeds should be encouraged as normal. You may find that your baby's demand for feeds increases. You may also be advised to give extra fluids (either water or rehydration drinks) in between feeds.
If you are travelling to a destination at high risk for traveller's diarrhoea, you might want to consider buying oral rehydration sachets for children before you travel. These can provide a perfect balance of water, salts and sugar for them and can be used for fluid replacement. Remember that, as mentioned above, safe water is needed to reconstitute the sachets.
If your child vomits, wait 5-10 minutes and then start giving drinks again but more slowly (for example, a spoonful every 2-3 minutes). Use of a syringe can help in younger children who may not be able to take sips.
Note: if you suspect that your child is dehydrated, or is becoming dehydrated, you should seek medical advice urgently.
Fluids to treat dehydration
If your child is mildly dehydrated, this may be treated by giving them rehydration drinks. A doctor will advise about how much to give. This can depend on the age and the weight of your child. If you are breastfeeding, you should continue with this during this time. It is important that your child be rehydrated before they have any solid food.
Sometimes a child may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment if they are dehydrated. Treatment in hospital usually involves giving rehydration solution via a special tube called a 'nasogastric tube'. This tube passes through your child's nose, down their throat and directly into their stomach. An alternative treatment is with fluids given directly into a vein (intravenous fluids).
Eat as normally as possible once any dehydration has been treated
Correcting any dehydration is the first priority. However, if your child is not dehydrated (most cases), or once any dehydration has been corrected, then encourage your child to have their normal diet. Do not 'starve' a child with infectious diarrhoea. This used to be advised but is now known to be wrong. So:
Breastfed babies should continue to be breastfed if they will take it. This will usually be in addition to extra rehydration drinks (described above).
Breastfed babies should continue to be breastfed if they will take it. This will usually be in addition to extra rehydration drinks (described above).
Bottle-fed babies should be fed with their normal full-strength feeds if they will take it. Again, this will usually be in addition to extra rehydration drinks (described above). Do not water down the formula, or make it up with less water than usual. This can make a baby very ill.

Medication
Loperamide is not recommended for children with diarrhoea. There are concerns that it may cause a blockage of the gut (intestinal obstruction) in children with diarrhoea.
Most children with traveller's diarrhoea do not need treatment with antibiotics. However, for the same reasons as discussed for adults above, antibiotic treatment may sometimes be advised in certain cases.
Side-effects of traveller's diarrhoea
Most people have mild illness and complications of traveller's diarrhoea are rare. However, if complications do occur, they can include the following:
Salt (electrolyte) imbalance and dehydration.
This is the most common complication. It occurs if the salts and water that are lost in your stools (faeces), or when you are sick (vomit), are not replaced by you drinking adequate fluids. If you can manage to drink plenty of fluids then dehydration is unlikely to occur, or is only likely to be mild and will soon recover as you drink.
Severe dehydration can lead to a drop in your blood pressure. This can cause reduced blood flow to your vital organs. If dehydration is not treated, your kidneys may be damaged. Some people who become severely dehydrated need a 'drip' of fluid directly into a vein. This requires admission to hospital. People who are elderly or pregnant are more at risk of dehydration.
Reactive complications
Rarely, other parts of your body can 'react' to an infection that occurs in your gut. This can cause symptoms such as joint inflammation (arthritis), skin inflammation and eye inflammation (either conjunctivitis or uveitis). Reactive complications are uncommon if you have a virus causing traveller's diarrhoea.
Spread of infection
The infection can spread to other parts of your body such as your bones, joints, or the meninges that surround your brain and spinal cord. This is rare. If it does occur, it is more likely if diarrhoea is caused by salmonella infection.
Irritable bowel syndrome
Irritable bowel syndrome is sometimes triggered by a bout of traveller's diarrhoea.
Lactose intolerance
Lactose intolerance can sometimes occur for a period of time after traveller's diarrhoea. It is known as 'secondary' or 'acquired' lactose intolerance. Your gut (intestinal) lining can be damaged by the episode of diarrhoea. This leads to lack of a substance (enzyme) called lactase that is needed to help your body digest the milk sugar lactose.
Lactose intolerance leads to bloating, tummy (abdominal) pain, wind and watery stools after drinking milk. The condition gets better when the infection is over and the intestinal lining heals. It is more common in children.
Haemolytic uraemic syndrome
Usually associated with traveller's diarrhoea caused by a certain type of E. coli infection, haemolytic uraemic syndrome is a serious condition where there is anaemia, a low platelet count in the blood and kidney damage. It is more common in children. If recognised and treated, most people recover well.
Guillain-Barré syndrome
This condition may rarely be triggered by campylobacter infection, one of the causes of traveller's diarrhoea. It affects the nerves throughout your body and limbs, causing weakness and sensory problems. See the separate leaflet called Guillain-Barré syndrome for more details.
Reduced effectiveness of some medicines
During an episode of traveller's diarrhoea, certain medicines that you may be taking for other conditions or reasons may not be as effective. This is because the diarrhoea and/or being sick (vomiting) mean that reduced amounts of the medicines are taken up (absorbed) into your body.
Examples of such medicines are those for epilepsy, diabetes and contraception. Speak with your doctor or practice nurse before you travel if you are unsure of what to do if you are taking other medicines and develop diarrhoea.
How long does traveller's diarrhoea last?
As mentioned above, symptoms are usually short-lived and the illness is usually mild with most people making a full recovery within in few days. However, a few people with traveller's diarrhoea develop persistent (chronic) diarrhoea that can last for one month or more. It is also possible to have a second 'bout' of traveller's diarrhoea during the same trip. Having it once does not seem to protect you against future infection.
How can I avoid traveller's diarrhoea?
Avoid uncooked meat, shellfish or eggs. Avoid peeled fruit and vegetables (including salads).

Drinking bottled water and fizzy drinks that are in sealed bottles or cans, tea, coffee and alcohol is thought to be safe. However, avoid ice cubes and non-bottled water in alcoholic drinks. Food should be cooked through thoroughly and be piping hot when served.
You should also be careful when eating food from markets, street vendors or buffets if you are uncertain about whether it has been kept hot or kept refrigerated. Fresh bread is usually safe, as is canned food or food in sealed packs.
Be careful where you swim
Swimming in contaminated water can also lead to traveller's diarrhoea. Try to avoid swallowing any water as you swim; teach children to do the same.
Obtain travel health advice before you travel
Always make sure that you visit your GP surgery or private travel clinic for health advice in plenty of time before your journey. Alternatively, the Fit for Travel website (see under Further Reading and References, below) provides travel health information for the public and gives specific information for different countries and high-risk destinations. This includes information about any vaccinations required, advice about food, water and personal hygiene precautions, etc.
There are no vaccines that prevent traveller's diarrhoea as a whole. However, there are some other vaccines that you may need for your travel, such as hepatitis A, typhoid, etc. You may also need to take malaria tablets depending on where you are travelling.
Antibiotics
Taking antibiotic medicines to prevent traveller's diarrhoea (antibiotic prophylaxis) is not generally recommended. This is because for most people, traveller's diarrhoea is mild and self-limiting. Also, antibiotics do not protect against nonbacterial causes of traveller's diarrhoea, such as viruses and parasites. Antibiotics may have side-effects and their unnecessary use may lead to problems with resistance to medicines.
Probiotics
Probiotics have some effect on traveller's diarrhoea and can shorten an attack by about one day. It is not known yet which type of probiotic or which dose, so there are no recommendations about using probiotics to prevent traveller's diarrhoea.
