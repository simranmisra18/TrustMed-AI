Hi,
I have a low resting heart rate, as low as 37, but generally around 47. I do a fair amount of exercise and my doctor has said it is probably down to this. However, I also have regular eptopic beats, 16% according to the Holter meter.
I’ve got to go and see a cardiologist to ensure there is no underlying problem. Has anyone else experienced these issues together and what can I expect from the meeting with the cardiologist?
Many thanks
Craig

ya, i also have a low heart rate and a high burden of PVCs . I’ve been dealing with those little f’kers for 30 years and i’m still here. i even get runs of NSVT but never actually caught on an ECG. My heart has been a devastating form of anxiety and panic my entire life. When they are real bad i have the worst panic attacks even though i should know they are benign. i’m a medical professional and have to say that Doctors tend to dismiss these complaints as more of an inconvenience rather than something they should treat. just venting a bit. hope you’re well.
