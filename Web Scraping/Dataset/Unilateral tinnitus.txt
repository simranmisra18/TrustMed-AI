Hello All,
I have been coping with unilateral tinnitus on the left side for 6 years. Sounds like a typewriter or a buzzing noise, 24/7. Trouble sleeping, can’t go to restaurants, so noisy, the tinnitus is worse. CT showed nothing, ENT doctor said “anxiety” but wouldn’t prescribe any meds. Suggested an MRI with contrast but the gadolinium contrast agent is a heavy metal and very risky. There are no other symptoms. Tried the Lipoflavinoids but they did not help. B-Vitamins also did not help. Anybody got a suggestion?

Thanks for your reply Annrosie. I saw the surgical ENT who suggested, mildly, an MRI with contrast. I lost my job and had to retire prematurely because of the tinnitus. Have seen 5 ENTs. The gadolinium contrast is a heavy metal and there are dozens of lawsuits by those who have suffered brain damage because the gadolinium does all get flushed out of your brain so I said no to that. No sense making things worse. Nobody knows what exactly is the cause but lots of people suffer with it.

Thanks Annrosie. I am in the states and no doctor believes this is a disabling condition. Have one other problem that is also disabling but I am a caregiver for an elderly lady and need to write my book so I must keep going as long as God lets me.
