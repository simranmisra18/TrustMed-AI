Mostsly at night just around going to bed my back itches for about an hour or so then it clears. Sometines my scalp as well. I have tried to find a cause like allergy but no lck so far. Really odd as otherwise it does not come up. my back does get little scabby areas which itch. Like flaky skin but hard. Any ideas welcome.
