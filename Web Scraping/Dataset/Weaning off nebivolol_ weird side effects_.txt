this drug has caused side effects that are rather unbearable. upset stomach, headaches, even a bit of depression. two weeks ago i spoke with my doc and we decided i could start taking a lower dose. after a week and a half of the lower dose i started to feel strange - extremely anxious, jumpy, scary thoughts, panic, as well as my bp and hr skyrocketing. i then began taking the higher dose ive been taking for the last 2 years and id be lying if i said i felt 100% myself again still anxious and rather panicky. i’m wondering if this was caused by lowering my dose? any body else had an experience like this?
