Swollen eyelid causes
Inflammation (due to allergy, infection, or injury), infection and trauma can all cause swelling of the eyelids. In some cases swelling of the eyelid may be the only symptom but in others the eyelid is also likely to be red, itchy, gritty or sore.
Common causes of swollen eyelids include:
Chalazion
A chalazion causes a lump or localised swelling in the eyelid, although it can cause the whole of the eyelid to swell, particularly if it becomes inflamed or infected.
A chalazion occurs when one of the Meibomian (or tarsal) glands in the eyelid becomes blocked, resulting in a small (2-8 mm) fluid-filled swelling (cyst). A chalazion is more common on the upper eyelid. It is not usually itchy or painful but it can be red or darker than surrounding skin.
See the separate leaflet called Chalazion.

Stye
A stye is a common painful eyelid problem, where a small infection forms at the base of an eyelash, which becomes swollen and red, along with the surrounding edge of the eyelid.
It looks like a pus-filled spot. However, the infection and inflammation often spread back into the lid to make the whole eyelid swollen. It is usually red, as well as swollen, and can sometimes feel slightly sore.
See the separate leaflet called Stye.

Ectropion and entropion
An ectropion occurs when part or all of the lower eyelid turns outwards away from the eye. An entropion occurs where the lower eyelid turns in towards the eye, causing the eyelashes to rub against the front of the eye.
The eyelids can occasionally become inflamed and a little swollen, although this is not usually dramatic.
See the separate leaflets called Ectropion and Entropio for more details.
Eye with ectropion
Eye with entropion
Blepharitis
Blepharitis means inflammation of the eyelids. It makes the eyes and eyelids feel sore and gritty. They are often puffy, pink-red, and a little swollen, particularly along the lid edges.
Blepharitis can be a troublesome and recurring condition, sometimes associated with other skin conditions such as rosacea and seborrhoeic dermatitis.
See the separate leaflet called Blepharitis.

Conjunctivitis (pink eye)
Conjunctivitis is inflammation or infection of the conjunctiva (the smooth, shiny, translucent membrane that covers the white of the eye (sclera) and the underside of the eyelids).
It can be caused by allergies and sensitivities (for example, to make-up), or by infection.
The main symptoms of conjunctivitis are redness of the eye, and a feeling of grittiness and mild soreness. As conjunctivitis affects the underside of the eyelids, it can make the eyelids puffy and a little red, either because the infection spreads into the eyelid or because the eyelid becomes inflamed or reacts in an allergic manner due to the infection. There may be some pus, or the eye may just be watery.
See the separate leaflets called Allergic conjunctivitis and Infective conjunctivitis.
Bacterial conjunctivitis

Eyelid skin infection
Any infection in the skin of the eyelid will tend to cause marked swelling, with redness, itching and soreness. Infection can also spread to the eyelids from other parts of the face.
Infections of the skin include cellulitis, impetigo and erysipelas, which are different types of skin infection affecting different levels of the skin. A skin infection is more likely if the integrity of the skin is broken for some reason. This might include a condition affecting the skin close to the eye, such as eczema, chickenpox or shingles.
Periorbital cellulitis

Sinusitis
Sinusitis is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection, although it may also be caused by allergy. Sinusitis affecting the sinuses just beneath the eyes can cause puffiness around the eyes, affecting the eyelids. The eyelids are not usually red, sore or itchy.
See the separate leaflet called Sinusitis.
Sinuses
Allergic eyelid swelling
Allergies occur when the body reacts to a foreign substance (called an allergen) by producing chemicals which cause swelling, redness and itching.
Eyelid swelling caused by an allergic reaction can be significant, since the eyelid tissue is stretchy and also tends to be quite 'reactive' to allergic stimuli. Allergic eyelid swelling is often therefore quite dramatic.
The eyelids can feel tight and may even be so swollen that the eyes can't open. Over time the extra fluid in the eyelids tends to drop downwards through the action of gravity to fill the area of the lower lid down to the top of the cheek, causing large 'bags' under the eyes.
Sometimes overnight, when lying on one's side, gravity results in swelling of one eyelid even though the trigger is an allergen such as pollen.
Eyelids can react in an allergic manner to various triggers, including:
Naturally occurring substances such as pollens, pet hair and organic dust.

Chemicals such as shampoo, make-up, eye drops and contact lens solution.
Chemicals such as shampoo, make-up, eye drops and contact lens solution.
Infectious agents such as viruses and bacteria (which can therefore sometimes cause infection AND allergy at the same time).

Angio-oedema
This is sometimes known as angio-neurotic oedema and is a skin reaction, usually caused by an allergy, that tends to cause marked skin swelling, sometimes with itching. Mostly, it affects the eyelids and face, and sometimes the lining of the windpipe (which can make breathing difficult) and the hands and feet.
Angio-oedema
By James Heilman, MD, Own work), via Wikimedia Commons
It can sometimes be non-allergic, and be triggered by extremes of temperature, or by infections. Rarely, it can be an inherited condition.
See the separate leaflet called Angio-oedema.
Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis, or anaphylactic shock, is a medical emergency. It is an extreme and generalised allergic reaction affecting most of the bodily systems. It can include dramatic eyelid swelling, which can be an early warning sign although it is not the most important symptom.
Anaphylaxis can cause faintness, breathing difficulties and collapse, and anaphylaxis tends to come on quickly, the full effects sometimes developing over a few minutes and usually within an hour of symptoms beginning.
Occasionally, anaphylactic reactions to food can come on more than an hour after eating the food, but this is not the usual pattern. If you have marked eyelid swelling but have no other obvious developing symptoms, you are unlikely to be developing anaphylaxis.
See the separate leaflet called Anaphylaxis.
Eyelid irritation
The eyelids can become puffy, swollen and red because they are irritated by grit, dust or bonfire or cigarette smoke, without a true allergic reaction. The eyes are also usually red and watery too.
Eyelid sunburn
Sunburn of the eyelids happens easily, particularly if falling asleep lying in the sun. The lids are swollen, red and sore. Sunglasses and the use of sun cream help to protect the eyelids against sunburn.
Fluid retention due to other medical conditions
Fluid can gather throughout the body when retaining fluid - a condition called oedema. Whilst fluid retention is often noticeable in the fingers, around the lips and lower face, around the feet and ankles, and in the lower part of the back, it may also be noticed in the eyelids.
Fluid retention
By Klaus D Peter (Own work), via Wikimedia Commons
Fluid retention and tissue swelling of this type can occur because of generalised allergic reactions (see below) or due to retaining fluid because of medication or to a medical condition such as heart failure or pre-eclampsia (a condition related to pregnancy).
Intravenous fluids given as part of medical treatment can sometimes cause facial and eyelid swelling, particularly if needing to be given a lot of fluids quickly (for example, because of dehydration). This is particularly likely in someone who is unwell and has been lying flat, so that the extra fluid has tended to gather in the face and eyelids and has not yet dispersed evenly. However, generalised swelling due to medical treatment is more often an allergic reaction than an 'expected' reaction of this sort.
Eyelid trauma and black eye
Any direct injury to the eyelid will tend to make it swell and bruise, and the swelling is often very much worse the next day. A black eye can be caused by direct injury to the eyelid, but commonly also results from a blow to the nose or forehead. A blow to the nose often results in black eyes on both sides - and cosmetic surgery to the nose or face can have the same result.
Black eye
By Pavel Ševela (Own work), via Wikimedia Commons
The looseness of the eyelid skin means that blood can easily pool in this area after injury - and where blood pools, swelling will follow. As the black eye heals, the swelling gradually decreases, and the bruise goes through several stages before fading. It can take several weeks after this for the swelling to fully settle. See the separate leaflet called Dealing with eye injuries.
Head trauma
A significant head injury resulting in a fracture of the base of the skull, can cause two swollen black eyes, sometimes called 'raccoon eyes'. See the separate leaflet called Head injuries.

Facial, nose or eyelid surgery
Eyelid surgery, sometimes done to correct entropion or ectropion (see above), or for cosmetic reasons, is an example of intentional injury to the eyelids which causes bruising and swelling. The eyelids can be so swollen after eyelid procedures that the eyes are unable to open for several days.
Eyelid swelling and bruising often also results from other surgery to the nose and lower face. This is because the blood from these procedures tends to track behind the skin of the face to areas where it can pool easily causing swelling, and this includes the eyelids. The bruising and swelling can be dramatic and can take several weeks to settle down completely.
After crying
Most people will have noticed eyelid swelling after crying, particularly if this is prolonged. This occurs because the eyelids tend to absorb some of the extra tears, leading them to become temporarily swollen.
Chemical irritation and burns
Some chemicals can irritate the eyelids, causing them to swell. This can occur with some make-up products and soaps. Many people will be familiar with the eyelid irritation and swelling caused by chlorine in swimming pools. Tear gas, sometimes used to dispel crowds, causes swelling and inflammation of the eyelids, although sore and tearful eyes are the main symptoms of exposure.
Some chemicals can cause serious injury to the eyelids, beginning with swelling and pain. The causes include some everyday household chemicals such as oven cleaners, which contain strong alkali, and which might be transferred to the eyelids by rubbing the eyes.
If a chemical injury to your eyelids or eyes is suspected, they should be washed as thoroughly as possible. Run 20 litres of water over them directly from the tap, keeping running water on your open eye or eyes for 5-10 minutes, before seeking medical advice.
See the separate leaflet called Dealing with eye injuries.

Eye health
Ectropion is a condition in which part or all of the lower eyelid turns outwards away from the eye. There are various causes but the most common cause is an ageing effect of the eyelid that occurs in some older people. A straightforward operation can usually cure the problem.

When to see a doctor about a swollen eyelid
Many cases of swollen eyelids will get better on their own or can be treated with medication bought over the counter.
However, You should see a doctor if:
Vision is significantly impaired (more than just being blurry due to a watery eye and recovering fully when you wipe your eyes).

Usually a pharmacist is usually a sensible first port of call - they are well trained to deal with these issues and will advise if it is something that can be treated over the counter.
Frequently asked questions
How long will a swollen eyelid last?
A swollen eyelid can last for a day, several days, or even several weeks depending on the cause. If your eyelid swelling hasn't improved after 24-48 hours, you should seek medical help.
Is a hot or cold compress better for swollen eyelids?
A cold compress helps reduce swelling, puffiness, and redness, whilst a warm compress soothes the eyelid and eases pain.
Can make-up cause an eyelid to swell?
Make-up can cause an eyelid to swell due to an allergic reaction to ingredients, irritation from sensitive skin, or from bacteria if products are old or contaminated.
How to get rid of itchy eyelids?
You can soothe itchy eyelids by gently cleaning them with warm water, using a cold compress, and avoiding rubbing them. Avoiding triggers and using over-the-counter lubricating eye drops may also help.

A chalazion is a common condition affecting the eyelid and is caused by a blockage and inflammation of a gland in the eyelid. The swelling (cyst) is usually felt as a small painless lump. It can become infected or painful. If it is causing problems and does not settle on its own, it can be medically treated with an injection or removed with a small operation.

What is a chalazion?
Eye with upper eyelid chalazion
A chalazion is a small (2-8 mm) swelling in the eyelid. It arises due to inflammation causing a reaction known as a "granuloma" - this is a swelling filled with white blood cells and other tissue. It is common and sometimes called a meibomian cyst or tarsal cyst. A chalazion is more common on the upper eyelid. It is possible to have several at once, in more than one eyelid. It is not the same as a stye.

Chalazion vs Stye
A chalazion is caused by a blockage of a gland in the eyelid, whereas a stye is due to an infected eyelash follicle.
What is a chalazion?
Stye vs Chalazion vs Hordeolum
A hordoleum is another word for a stye. These can be internal (an infection of the Meibomian gland) or external (an infection of the eyelash follicle) A chalazion is not an infection but is an inflammation. Sometimes it can be difficult to tell the difference between an internal hodoleum (stye) and an inflamed chalazion but the treatment for them both is the same.
Chalazion causes
There are tiny glands just under the inner surface of the eyelid, called meibomian glands. These make an oily fluid called meibum to help lubricate the eye.
If the gland becomes blocked then the meibum cannot escape into the tears. It may expand into a swelling and leak into the eyelid tissue. This becomes inflamed. Over time, inflammation causes a lump (or granuloma) to form in the eyelid. This is a firm, solid lump that remains for a long time. This lump is the chalazion.
Chalazion is more common in people who have an eye condition known as blepharitis, or skin conditions such as eczema, because in these conditions the meibum tends to be thicker so the gland is more easily blocked.
It is most commonly found in adults between the ages of 30 and 50.
See the separate leaflets called Stye and Blepharitis for more details.

Chalazion treatment
No treatment may be necessary as up to half of people get better without any treatment. This can take between two and six months but if the chalazion is not causing any problems, it is best just to watch and wait. Further treatment options include:
Warm compresses can help to reduce discomfort and also may disperse the chalazion. A clean flannel that has been in hot water should be held gently but firmly against the closed eye for 5-10 minutes, 3-4 times a day. The flannel cools quickly so should be warmed again regularly. This warmth and slight pressure may be enough to soften the contents of the fluid-filled swelling (cyst), helping it drain more easily. (The water should be hot but comfortable and not scalding.)

Cleaning the eyelid twice per day removes grease and dead skin cells that may contribute to cysts forming. A weak solution of baby shampoo in warm water is ideal and a cotton bud can be used to clean the eyelids with this.

A small operation is an option if it is troublesome or persistent. A referral to an ophthalmologist is needed and the operation is usually done under local anaesthetic, although children and some adults may not tolerate this and may require general anaesthetic. The eyelid is numbed. A small cut is then made on the inside of the eyelid to release the contents of the cyst and it is scraped out. After surgery antibiotic drops or ointment are commonly prescribed.

Are there any complications?
Most chalazia cause no problems. A cyst can become infected.
Rarely, this infection can spread to involve the whole eyelid and tissues surrounding the eye. The eyelid may be very swollen and red. It might be difficult to open the eye and there may be a lot of pain and a high temperature (fever). This type of complication is called orbital cellulitis and it is important to seek urgent medical advice, usually in an emergency department of a hospital. Treatment of orbital cellulitis is with antibiotics, usually into a vein (intravenously) via a drip, in hospital.
Will it happen again?
A chalazion usually only occurs once. However, some people are prone to developing them and they may recur. It is sometimes possible to prevent a chalazion developing by using a hot compress on the eyelids (described above) and massaging the eyelids each morning.

Eye floaters and flashes are common symptoms which often affect normal eyes. They usually occur because of changes that happen in the jelly-like substance inside the eye (which is called the vitreous humour). The most common causes need no treatment, do not prevent normal visual tasks and tend to settle by themselves. However, flashes and floaters can occasionally be warning signs of a serious condition, such as a retinal tear or retinal detachment.
Haloes are bright circles which seem to surround a source of light. They are also referred to as glare. They are a common symptom, particularly in older people. They can be unpleasant and uncomfortable and lead to temporary dazzling; this may particularly affect driving at night. They can sometimes be a sign of underlying eye conditions such as glaucoma.

Floaters are shapes (opacities) floating in the field of vision and usually have the following qualities:
They may look like spots, threads, spiders or cobwebs.

What causes eye floaters?
Most floaters are also caused by changes in the vitreous humour. Most commonly this is due to normal ageing of the eye, when opacities form in the clear jelly and drift around. These kinds of floater are not associated with eye flashes or reduction in your vision and they tend to come on gradually.

Floaters can also occur after posterior vitreous detachment. In this case there will be a sudden obvious increase in the number of floaters. Eye flashes may also occur. Again, there should be no loss of vision and most cases settle without causing any problems.

What are eye flashes?
Eye flashes are unexplained brief flashing lights in the eyes; they can be seen in one or both eyes. They often occur on the edges of vision and they are fairly common. Each flash, which can vary from a sparkle to a bright light, lasts a varying length of time. Periods of flashing can go on for several months. The symptoms are often most noticeable when going from a light to a dark room.
What causes eye flashes?
Eye flashes are most commonly due to age-related changes in the vitreous humour. The vitreous humour is the jelly-like substance which fills the inside of the eye, between the lens and the retina. The vitreous humour is contained in a fine membrane and this is attached to the retina at the back and the lens at the front.
Side View of the Eye
Age
As we age, the vitreous humour (or vitreous gel) shrinks and as it does so it can pull on the retina. This can cause eye flashes because the pulling triggers nerves in the retina and they send signals to the seeing nerve (optic nerve).
Eventually the vitreous membrane tends to pull right off the retina, a condition called posterior vitreous detachment. This condition is harmless in itself, and in fact it happens to almost everyone eventually. The vitreous is detached from the retina in 75% of people aged over 65 and this is usually harmless.
Vitreous detachment
The flashes of vitreous detachment may occur in one or both eyes. If they occur in both eyes this is because the same thing is happening in each eye separately (but since the eyes are usually very similar this can occur at the same time).
Sometimes, as the vitreous pulls on the retina, it can tear it, causing a retinal tear or a retinal detachment. However, most vitreous detachment does not harm the retina.
Eye conditions
Conditions which affect the retina may also cause eye flashes. These include diabetic eye disease and sickle cell disease. Again, these can affect one or both eyes.
Migraines
Eye flashes can also relate to migraines. Some people with migraine experience flashing lights. Usually, in migraine, these occur in both eyes simultaneously. They can last up to an hour and tend to increase to a maximum before fading away and being replaced by a headache, which is typically one-sided and which may or may not be severe.
Charles Bonnet syndrome
Charles Bonnet syndrome is a condition experienced by people, usually elderly people, whose vision is deteriorating. The brain, deprived of real visual information, can "make things up" instead, particularly in conditions of low light. Patients may sometimes see flashes, although more frequently they see complex visual images like children or animals, which can look very real.
Are flashes in the eyes serious?
Most eye flashes are caused by changes in the vitreous humour which are related to age and which are harmless. Occasionally flashes can be a sign that the retina is at risk of being torn or detached.
Increasing, persistent or constant flashes all suggest strong pulling on the retina and may mean that there is a risk of retinal damage. Flashes accompanied by a shadow coming down over the vision is suggestive of retinal detachment.
For further detail see the separate leaflet called Retinal detachment. Retinal detachment can lead to permanent vision loss.
Some people are at greater risk of retinal detachment than others, including:
Those who have already had a retinal detachment in the other eye.

People who are extremely short-sighted (correction more than -6.00 ) are at higher risk, as the globe of their eye tends to be longer so that the vitreous is more likely to pull away.

What are eye haloes?
Haloes are rainbow-like coloured rings around lights or bright objects. They usually occur because there is extra water in the layers of the eye. The most common and important cause of this is acute glaucoma.
Glaucoma is a condition where there is increased pressure in the eye. Acute glaucoma is a very painful condition which can threaten sight if not treated promptly. However, another cause - chronic glaucoma - comes on more gradually and is not painful.
Many other conditions can lead to the experience of haloes. These include watering or tearful eyes, overuse of contact lenses, cataracts and opacities in the vitreous humour. Some prescribed medicines may also cause people to see haloes, including digoxin and chloroquine.
Are eye haloes serious?
Because haloes can be a sign of increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma) then it is important to see an optician if persistent haloes develop. It is also important not to drive in conditions where haloes may affect the vision - for example, when driving at night.
If you have any doubts about your fitness to drive it is your responsibility to speak to the DVLA, who will advise you.
Who develops eye floaters, flashes and haloes?
Most people will notice occasional floaters, as there are often small opacities and crystals in the vitreous. Because more marked floaters, together with eye flashes and haloes, are mostly caused by conditions occurring naturally in older eyes, most people who experience frequent floaters are over 60 years of age.
Children and young adults may also experience eye flashes, floaters and haloes, particularly if there has been trauma or surgery to the eye or if they have other existing eye disease. These might include inflammatory conditions of the eye like uveitis, and conditions which can affect the retina like sickle cell disease and the form of retinopathy that can affect very premature babies.
When should I worry about eye floaters, flashes or haloes?
Urgent medical advice should be sought if eye floaters and flashes are very marked or sudden in onset. Urgent advice should also be sought if they are associated with pain, changes in the vision, or if both floaters and flashes are occurring together. Optician advice should also be obtained if persistent haloes develop.
People who have previously lost the sight in one eye should seek advice for any new symptoms, even if less severe.
Most opticians are able to check the pressures in the eyes in order to rule out glaucoma. They also have equipment to allow them to perform detailed eye exams to look for damage to the retina. This equipment (called a slit lamp) is also available in A&E departments. Most GPs do not have slit lamps and will redirect to A and E or the optician depending on the urgency required.

A stye is a common but painful eyelid infection. It usually looks like a small red bump on the edge of the eyelid. Most styes get better on their own and do not need medical treatment. Hot compresses can ease the pain and encourage the stye to burst.

What is a stye?
Styes are a type of bacterial infection of the eyelid, typically causing a painful red bump either inside or outside of it.
They are a very common eye problem and usually develop quite quickly, over a few days. Usually only one eye is affected, although you can develop more than one stye at a time, even on the same lid.
What is a stye?
Types of stye
There are two types of stye: external styes (the common type) and internal styes (which are quite uncommon).
External stye (external hordeolum)
This is the common type of stye. Technically it is an external stye; however, it is often just called a stye. It appears along the edge of the eyelid, due to infection in the eyelash follicle (where one of your eyelashes attaches to your eyelid).
It may start off as a small red lump but, as it develops into a collection of pus (a little abscess), it looks like a yellow pus-filled spot. The edge of the eyelid around it becomes reddened and swollen, and the lid is painful.

Internal stye (internal hordeolum)
An internal stye arises when oil glands in the main part of the eyelid (meibomian gland) become clogged with oil and then infected. The infection comes to a head on the inner surface of the eyelid, against the eyeball, so that from the outside it is visible only as a swelling.
Internal styes may be painful, although often they cause a dull aching in the eyelid, sometimes with the sensation of a lump. Internal styes are much less common than external styes.

What causes a stye?
Eye with upper eyelid stye
People often ask 'what causes styes in adults'? Most styes usually occur for no obvious reason, although if your eyelids are itchy or rubbed a lot this may make an external stye more likely.
The usual germ (bacterium) that causes the infection is called Staphylococcus aureus. It is a common germ that is often found on healthy skin. It usually does no harm. However, it can occasionally get into the skin, where it causes infections such as spots, abscesses, and styes.
Risk factors
Some people have an eyelid condition called blepharitis. This is an inflammation of the eyelids in which they can become swollen, dry and itchy. Blepharitis can make you more prone to developing styes.
If you have acne, rosacea or seborrheic dermatitis you may be more prone to developing styes.
Diabetes that is not well controlled also increases the risk of infections.
Eye health
A chalazion is a common condition affecting the eyelid and is caused by a blockage and inflammation of a gland in the eyelid. The swelling (cyst) is usually felt as a small painless lump. It can become infected or painful. If it is causing problems and does not settle on its own, it can be medically treated with an injection or removed with a small operation.

Stye treatment
Most people want to know how to get rid of a stye.
Styes often need no treatment. The 'head' or 'point' usually bursts within 3-4 days.

It is sensible to discard mascara and eyeliners that you used along the edge of your eyelid as the stye was forming. This is to avoid any chance of re-infecting the eye. Options to speed up resolution of the stye are:
No treatment
Often, no treatment is necessary to get rid of a stye. Once a 'head' or 'point' has formed on a stye, most burst within 3-4 days, with the tiny amount of pus draining away and leaving no further problem. 'Popping' the stye in the eye (like a zit) is not recommended.
Hot compresses
These may help to ease soreness and draw the pus to a head. You can do this yourself: Hold a clean flannel, which has been dipped in warm water and squeezed dry, gently but firmly against the closed eye. Do this for 5-10 minutes, 3-4 times a day. (The water should be hot; it should be comfortable and not scalding.)
Eventually the stye will 'pop' and drain - but do not be tempted to try to pop it yourself. You may make things worse by injuring the delicate eyelid, or by spreading infection deeper into the tissues.
Epilation of the eyelash
This is a treatment for an external stye. It means that the eyelash is plucked out. Epilation is briefly uncomfortable but it can help the infection from the hair follicle to drain.
Incision and drainage of an external stye
A health professional can perform this procedure, which is a treatment for an external stye. It is like lancing a boil. A sterile needle (or perhaps a small scalpel) can be used to open the stye and drain the pus.
You should not attempt this yourself, as you might spread the infection to the eyelid, with serious consequences.
Drainage of an internal stye
This procedure involves using an injection of local anaesthetic to numb your eyelid, which must be flipped 'inside out' in order to expose the stye before it can be scraped out.
Very occasionally this procedure is done under general anaesthetic, as it is uncomfortable and children, in particular, find it difficult. After this procedure, antibiotic eye drops are usually given.
How long does a stye last?
A stye will usually burst on its own in 3-4 days, but they can sometimes last up to 1-2 weeks.
Are styes contagious?
Styes are not contagious. However, to reduce the chance of the infection spreading:
Always wash your hands after touching the affected eyelid.

Do not wear contact lenses or eye make-up until the infection has settled.

Are there any complications?
Most styes are very minor infections that clear without any treatment and cause no problems. Styes do not affect your vision.
Stye prevention
Styes are caused by a bacterium (Staphylococcus) getting into the blocked oil glands of the eyelid, so paying attention to good eye hygiene will help prevent styes occurring.
Remove eye makeup before going to bed.

Can a stye turn into a chalazion?
Sometimes the stye doesn't go away, and can turn into a cyst called a chalazion. If this happens it doesn't look particularly red and it doesn't hurt. However, you will have a lump on your eyelid.
Why do I keep getting styes?
Recurrent styes may be due to underlying skin conditions such as blepharitis or acne, or poor eye hygiene. They can also recur because of an underlying condition (such as diabetes) that makes infection more likely. Preventing recurrence can be achieved by good management of diabetes, blepharitis and acne, and good eye hygiene. This involves: removing eye makeup, replacing old eye makeup regularly, washing hands before touching the eyes or contact lenses and avoiding sharing makeup, towels, pillows, or other personal items.
Can a stye turn into conjunctivitis?
Very occasionally the infection can spread. It may spread to the surface of the eye, causing conjunctivitis, which may need antibiotic ointment or drops to clear the infection.
Alternatively the infection can spread around the eyelid, causing it to become more red and swollen. If this happens you should see your GP as you may need antibiotic tablets.
Can a stye turn into orbital cellulitis?
An extremely rare complication of a stye occurs when the infection spreads to involve the whole eyelid and tissues surrounding and behind the eye. This is called orbital cellulitis.
The eyelid may be very swollen and red, it may hurt or be impossible to open the eye and you may have a lot of pain and a high temperature (fever). Sometimes the eyeball is pushed forwards so that it bulges, and you may be very sensitive to the light.
If you develop this type of complication, you need to see a medical professional urgently. Treatment of orbital cellulitis is with antibiotics, usually given into a vein (intravenously) via a drip, in hospital.
