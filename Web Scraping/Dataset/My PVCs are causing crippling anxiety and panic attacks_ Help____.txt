i am at my wits end. My heart anxiety has almost ruined my life. I ended up with a severe substance abuse problem resulting in rehab. i also suffer from depression and agoraphobia. Symptoms started around 19 and have gotten incrementally worse. I also suffered from SVT which was never treated or diagnosed . They always came back with anxiety. i will get a burst of bygemini and couplets which puts the fear of God in me. i become paralyzed with fear that it will trigger a deadly arrhythmia. i am scared to venture into the world. I am a Paramedic and know just enough to be scary. i will be starting some psycho therapy shortly. any advice will be appreciated.
