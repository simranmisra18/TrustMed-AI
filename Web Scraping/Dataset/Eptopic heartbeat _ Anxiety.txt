Hi, I’ve suffered with anxiety and anxiety attacks for almost 10 years now. however i have recently been diagnosed with an eptopic heartbeat. This started in February this year and they are just getting worse and worse to the point its really affecting my sleep. i prob average around 3-4 hours a night, my eptopic heartbeat is worse when i lay down and then i worry that something is really wrong and something terrible is going to happen to me which results in anxiety attack. does anyone have any recommendations for sleep and how to be calm because the thought of going to sleep now every night is the part of the day i absolutely dread. ive tried calm tablets, nytol, CBD oil, calming green tea, breathing techniques, sleep stories. any help would be greatly appreciated
