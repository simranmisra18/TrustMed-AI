Took 16 oral doses of Terbinafine 2 months ago for toenail fungus, 250mg pills. Developed terrible insomnia, anxiety, loss of appetite and other troubling symptoms. At first did not relate my insomnia to Terbinafine, then decided to search the web and found lot of info, that yes it is indeed a side effect, not common but also lots of personal reports on the web about it. Just wondering if anyone had this experience and how long it took to get back to normal? I am 7 weeks off the drug, and I still a mess, can barely function some days when I only get 2 hours of sleep. I've gone on and off sleep meds, but never get a full night sleep I feel the effects of terbinafine are so powerful. I've read terbinafine has a long half life 200-400hours and it stay is your tissues. Some people have posted a side effect of loss of taste that takes 12 weeks to get back to normal, just wondering if I need to endure 12 weeks of insomnia?
