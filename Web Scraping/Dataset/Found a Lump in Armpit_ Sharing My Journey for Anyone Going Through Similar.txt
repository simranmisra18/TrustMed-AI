Hi ladies,
I wanted to share something, in case it helps someone else. I’m 48, and back in April, I found a lump in my right armpit. It felt like an axillary lymph node, and of course, I went straight to Google, which was a mistake. Everything I read scared me to death.
I started using AI tools to get more info, and that helped a bit. I realized I didn’t have any other symptoms, no fatigue, no fever, nothing alarming. The lump wasn’t growing fast, though sometimes it felt more noticeable. I think it may have gotten a little bigger over time, but not dramatically.
I turned to forums like this one to read about other women’s experiences. That helped emotionally, but most posts weren’t very detailed. Because I was so worried and found that forums were more comforting than random searches, I wanted to share my own story, to give back and maybe help someone else feel concerned.
I couldn’t get in to see my doctor until early September, so I had a long wait filled with worry. When I finally saw her, we did blood work, which came back normal, huge relief. She ordered a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. The timing wasn’t ideal, it was a week before my period, and my breasts were sore and tender. That was a new symptom, but since it was both breasts and I read it’s common in perimenopause, I didn’t panic.
The mammogram didn’t show anything major, but they did notice something in the right breast, near where the lump is. So, they did ultrasounds of both the right breast and armpit. Turns out, the thing in the breast was just an inflamed lymph node, probably due to hormones fluctuation and my upcoming period. As for the lump in my armpit, they said it’s just “extra tissue.” Nothing to worry about, even though I’m quite thin.
I haven’t seen the full ultrasound report yet, so I’m still curious about how they described the lump. But the nurse was kind and reassuring, she told me everything looked fine and that I could go enjoy my day with peace of mind.
So that’s where I’m at. Still keeping an eye on things but feeling much calmer. If you’re going through something similar, I see you. It’s scary, but you’re not alone.
Sending love and strength to all of you
