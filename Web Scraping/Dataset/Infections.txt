Necrotising fasciitis
Infection can happen to any type of wound - whether that's a small cut, from a surgical procedure, or an accidental injury. Signs a wound is infected include worsening pain, swelling, and redness that spreads, increased heat around the wound, and pus. This leaflet discusses symptoms you should look out for, treatments, and when to seek medical help.

How to tell if a wound is infected
The body is usually very good at healing wounds. Wound healing requires inflammation: the body activates the immune system to repair damage, and so inflammation is a good thing at the beginning of wound healing.
Sometimes wounds can become infected, which might make them slower to heal, or cause other problems, such as a serious infection that spreads.
The body reacts to infection by producing more inflammation. So, an infected wound might have signs of too much inflammation.

It can sometimes be difficult to tell if a wound is infected so medical advice should be sought if unsure.
What to do if a wound is infected
Surgical wound infection
If you think a cut from an operation (a surgical wound) is infected, you should speak to a healthcare professional as soon as possible. It's best to contact the team who did the operation directly as they are responsible for all post-operative care as well. If that's not possible, it may be necessary to attend an urgent care centre or even the accident and emergency department.
A healthcare professional should ask a few questions and then examine the wound to determine if it's infected or not.
If they think it's infected, they might take a swab of the wound and any discharge. This is sent to a laboratory to find out which bacteria are causing the infection, and which antibiotics work against them. It takes several days for the result to come back.
Sometimes, if a more serious infection is suspected, blood tests and scans might be needed. These are usually done in hospital.
Trauma wound infection
With a laceration, cut or graze, keep an eye on it. You should:
Keep it clean by bathing it with warm water and clean cotton wool.

How do you treat an infected wound?
Treatments for an infected wound include:
No treatment: the body is usually good at fighting off minor infections, and mild wound infections can often be monitored to see if they get better on their own.

Do I need a tetanus injection?
Tetanus is a serious disease caused by germs which mostly live in soil or manure. Wounds which have been in contact with soil or manure, or which are particularly 'dirty', may increase the risk of developing tetanus. Tetanus is rare in the UK, because most people are protected from tetanus by vaccinations.
If you're fully up-to-date with your tetanus vaccines (you've had at least 3 vaccines, and the last vaccine was given less than 10 years ago), you don't need another vaccine after a wound.
If you've had at least 3 tetanus vaccines, but the last vaccine was given more than 10 years ago, you only need another tetanus vaccination if the wound is 'dirty' (eg, soil or dirt is in the wound). For a clean wound, you don't need another vaccination.
If you've never had the full initial course of tetanus vaccines (3 injections), you should have a tetanus vaccine after any wound, even if it's a 'clean' one.
Tetanus vaccines can be given by a nurse in a general practice surgery, or in the Emergency Department.
Why do wounds get infected?
Wounds heal best when they are clean and free from germs. Normally, many bacteria live harmlessly on our skin and in the environment around us. Normally the bacteria live on our skin, or in areas such as our nose, without causing any problems.
Usually the skin acts as a barrier. If the skin is broken, bacteria may spread into the more sensitive tissues underneath. This is how an infection can start. This makes the tissues sore and swollen, and less likely to heal. Open wounds are more likely than closed wounds to develop infections because the break in the skin provides a route for the germs to travel from the outside to the inside.
Some circumstances make it more likely that wounds will become infected. These include:
Having diabetes (type 1 or type 2).

Are wound infections dangerous?
Mild infections of small, shallow wounds can heal on their own, particularly in healthy people.
Sometimes, wound infections can spread and cause serious problems. This is more likely with large wounds, deep wounds, and surgical wounds, and in people who are more vulnerable to infection.
If a wound infection spreads, it can cause infection of the deep tissues under the skin (cellulitis). A severe wound infection may cause bacteria to enter the bloodstream, causing sepsis - which can be life-threatening.
If you have a wound and start to feel unwell in yourself, it is very important to know the signs of possible sepsis. Sepsis is always a medical emergency - if you have any concern that you might be developing sepsis, seek immediate medical help. See the sepsis leaflet for more information.
Other possible complications include:

How can I prevent wound infection?
Wound infection can largely be prevented by keeping the area clean.
Preventing infection in surgical wounds
During an operation the surgical team has strict procedures to try to help avoid infections. Surgical infections are monitored by the UK Health Security Agency so that policies can be changed and improved if needed.
There are a number of things that can be done by individuals to reduce the chance of infection. For example:
Have a shower or bath before the operation and wash with soap and water.

Do not use a razor to shave the area to be operated on as this makes infection more likely. If the hair needs to be removed, the surgical team will do this with clippers.

Frequently asked questions
How to know if a wound is septic?
If you have symptoms such as sudden confusion, feeling extremely unwell, difficulty breathing or breathing very fast, feeling cold or clammy, having pale or mottled skin, muscle pain, or blue, grey, or pale skin, lips or tongue, then you should seek medical help immediately as it could be a sign of sepsis.
Is saltwater good for infected wounds?
A sterile saline solution made up of cooled, boiled water and salt can help clean a wound and promote healing, but it isn’t a substitute for proper medical care. You should see a doctor or pharmacist if you have signs of an infected wound.
Can an infected wound cause nausea?
Severe infections can cause nausea alongside symptoms such as fever and chills. You should seek medical help if you have any of these symptoms.
How often should dressings be changed on an infected wound?
Dressings are usually changed once a day or when they become wet or dirty, but exactly how often depends on the type of wound and your doctor’s advice.

Fungi are a type of germ - they are all around us and don't usually cause any problems. Sometimes they can cause infections in the skin, hair and nails, which are treated with creams or tablets.
Occasionally fungi (which is the plural of fungus) can cause more serious infections, particularly if you are already ill. This can happen if you are taking medicines that cause you to have a weakened immune system, such as chemotherapy or some medications used to treat inflammatory conditions - this will put you at a higher risk of a fungal infection.

What are fungal infections?
What is a fungus?
A fungus is just a type of germ. They can range from tiny, invisible specks that float around in the air, all the way up to large growths like mushrooms. Fungi (the plural of fungus) are all around us and don't usually cause any problems.
However occasionally they can settle down and grow in places where they shouldn't: places on our bodies like our skin, nails, between our toes and, in women, the vagina and vulva.. This can happen even in people who are fairly healthy and is usually easy to treat with creams or pills.
Occasionally if someone's immune system is weak because they are battling cancer or on chemotherapy, fungi can grow in their lungs or elsewhere in the body. This then needs specialist treatment with strong antifungal medications either by pills or by infusions into a vein. See the separate leaflet called Fungal Lung Infections.
Types of fungal infections
Common types of fungal infections include:
Athlete's foot (tinea pedis)
is a condition in which fungi grow in between your toes, making the skin itchy and sore. It can be treated with a variety of creams which can be bought over the counter. You should generally go to see a pharmacist about this rather than to your GP, though people who have diabetes may need more medical input. See the separate leaflet called Athlete's Foot (Tinea Pedis).
Fungal groin infection (also known as jock itch)
Some people develop an itchy fungal infection in the skin at the top of their thighs (what doctors call the groin creases) or under the breasts. This usually goes away with an antifungal cream like miconazole. See the separate leaflet called Fungal Groin Infection (Tinea Cruris).
Ringworm
Most people will get something called ringworm at some point. This is a dry, slightly red circle of itchy skin usually on your leg or arm, or occasionally the scalp. It usually goes away with an antifungal cream. The classic appearance of ringwork is a scaly circle which clears from the centre, leaving the appearance of a ring.. See the separate leaflets called Ringworm (Tinea Corporis) and Fungal Scalp Infection (Scalp Ringworm).
Yeast infection
A fairly common condition, a vaginal yeast infection happens when fungus called Candida albicans grows in a woman's vagina, causes an itchy sensation and usually some vaginal discharge. This is called vaginal thrush and has a number of treatments ranging from a cream or a tablet to changes to your diet. Treatments can be bought over the counter. Thrush can sometimes happen as a side-effect of antibiotic use. See the separate leaflet called Vaginal Thrush (Yeast Infection).
Fungal nail infections
It is quite common to develop a fungal nail infection on the toenails. The symptoms of fungal nail infections are:
Nails turning white.
Nails turning white.
Nails becoming flaky and brittle.
Nails becoming flaky and brittle.
Nails growing into a curved-over shape instead of being fairly flat.
Nails growing into a curved-over shape instead of being fairly flat.
Treatment for this might include a paint or lotion to put on the nails, or a prescribed tablet - prescribed tablets can cause problems with the liver and so the need for treatment should be carefully discussed, as mostly fungal nail infections only cause cosmetic problems rather than pain or long-term harm. Your GP will usually want to prove the infection by sending off a sample of the nail to the laboratory, before prescribing a tablet. See the separate leaflet called Fungal Nail Infections (Tinea Unguium).
Where else in the body can fungi cause problems?
Occasionally fungi can grow in someone's ear canal, if they do a lot of swimming or diving or live in a humid environment. Sometimes fungi can grow in someone's lungs. This is serious and is usually related to the person already having a weak immune system, such as having cancer or receiving chemotherapy.
There is a rare condition called aspergillosis where a fungus causes an allergic reaction in your lungs and causes problems with breathing. This requires a specialist to diagnose and treat it. See the separate leaflet called Fungal Lung Infections.
Symptoms of fungal infections
The thing that is common to fungal skin infections is that the affected area tends to be itchy rather than painful and often makes the skin a bit flaky. They are contagious: you can catch it by touching the other person's skin. Although they are annoying and irritating, they are not usually serious.
Treatment of fungal infections
As already discussed, these are usually treated by a cream used in the affected area, but occasionally a tablet is used. Most of the time it is reasonable to consult a pharmacist in the first instance as they can often sort out treatment without you needing to see your GP and get a prescription medication.
How to prevent fungal infections
Fungal infections often happen in warm, wet areas of the body so making sure that you dry the relevant area thoroughly after a bath or after swimming is important, and generally keep areas such as between the toes and under the breasts clean and dry. Some women will find that avoiding perfumed soaps or bubble baths will help to reduce their risk of getting vaginal thrush.
Can yeast candida invade my body?
Like a lot of things in medicine, there are plenty of myths around fungi. Something that's caught hold in the last decade or so is the idea of having the fungus called candida floating around in your bloodstream, infecting your whole body. This is then blamed for common problems like irritability, fatigue, indigestion, headaches and sleep problems.
There is no proof that 'systemic candida' (as it's called) really exists, with the exception of some very unwell people whose immune system does not function properly and who may end up seriously ill and admitted to hospital. It is advisable to avoid buying any treatments for 'systemic candida' and to speak to a qualified and registered doctor about your concerns before spending any money.

Meets Patient’s editorial guidelines
Strep A, or Group A streptococcus, is a common type of bacteria, which has been recognised as a cause of infections for many years. Most Group A streptococcus infections are mild, but in rare cases, these can cause serious illness and even death.

What is strep A?
Strep A, or Group A streptococcus (GAS), is a type of bacteria, with the scientific name Streptococcus pyogenes - 'pyogenes' means 'pus-forming'.
Strep A is commonly found in healthy people; between 5 and 20% of healthy children with no symptoms of infection will have strep A living in their throats.
Sometimes, strep A bacteria cause infections - usually throat or skin infections (see 'Strep A symptoms' below).
Strep A symptoms
Strep A infections cause various different types of illnesses. The symptoms depend on what type of infection it is:
Throat infections: this is a very common type of strep A infection. Symptoms of throat infections and tonsillitis ('strep throat') due to strep A include:
A sore or painful throat.
Pain on swallowing.
Fever.
Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck.
Enlarged, swollen, and red tonsils.
White or yellow spots on the tonsils.
Nausea and vomiting.

Throat infections due to strep A have very similar symptoms to throat infections from other causes, such as viruses. Scores have been developed for healthcare professionals to use to estimate how likely strep A infection is; one example is the FeverPAIN score (see Further Reading).
Clinicians use these to help determine who is likely to benefit from antibiotics. Some symptoms are less common in strep A infection and more common in viral infections, such as a cough.
Scarlet fever: this is less common than tonsillitis. Scarlet fever causes a distinctive pinkish or red rash over the body, which feels rough or 'like sandpaper'. In people with black or brown skin, the colour change may be difficult to see, but the change in skin texture can still be felt.

Other symptoms of scarlet fever, alongside the rash, include:
Symptoms of a throat infection, as above (such as fever and sore throat).
A white coating on the tongue; over a few days this is replaced by a bright red tongue with small dots - called a 'strawberry tongue' because it can look like a ripe strawberry.

Strep A can also cause 'invasive' infections, which are more serious. These are rare. See the section on 'What is invasive Group A streptococcal disease?' below.
Is strep A contagious?
People who have infections due to strep A are contagious and can spread the infection to others. For example, people with scarlet fever (see below) need to stay at home for at least 24 hours after starting antibiotics, to reduce the risk of spreading it.
People who carry strep A, but don't have any signs or symptoms of infection, are thought to be much less contagious and do not need to take any special precautions. Most people who carry strep A in this way will be unaware of it
How long does strep A last?
People with Group A streptococcus infection often start to feel unwell 2–5 days after catching the bacteria.
The symptoms of strep A usually get better within a week without antibiotics, but this can vary. For those who do take an antibiotic, most will start feeling better 1–2 days after starting the antibiotic course.
How to treat strep A
Strep A infections are effectively treated by antibiotics, especially penicillin-based antibiotics. Treatment depends on what type of infection is present.
People who carry strep A in their throat, or on their skin, without any symptoms at all, do not need any treatment. This will only be detected if they have a throat or a skin swab for another reason.
Throat infections
Throat infections with strep A, such as bacterial tonsillitis, can be treated with tablet or liquid antibiotics. Other treatments for sore throats, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, can help with symptoms.
Healthcare professionals should use a clinical score system, such as FeverPAIN, to estimate how likely strep A infection is, and decide whether antibiotics might be helpful.
Most people with strep A throat infections will still get better without antibiotics; antibiotics seem to reduce the length of symptoms by about a day. Serious complications of strep A throat infections are rare, and most people get only minor benefits from antibiotics.
Scarlet fever
Scarlet fever should be treated with antibiotics, to reduce the risk of spreading it to other people. Penicillin antibiotics are best, but other drugs such as azithromycin can be used for people who are penicillin-allergic.
Children and adults with scarlet fever should stay away from school and work until 24 hours after starting antibiotics, to reduce the risk of spreading to others.
Healthcare professionals also need to tell the local public health team about any suspected cases of scarlet fever, so the public health doctors can monitor any outbreaks.
Impetigo
Impetigo can be treated with antibiotic creams if mild, or tablet/liquid antibiotics if more severe. People with impetigo should stay away from school or work until the skin rash has crusted or healed, or for the first 48 hours after starting antibiotic treatment.
Cellulitis
Cellulitis is treated with tablet or liquid antibiotics. If these don't work, or if the infection is severe, intravenous antibiotics (given with a drip) may be used.
Invasive Group A streptococcal infections
Invasive Group A streptococcal infections almost always need to be treated in hospital. People with these infections will usually be given intravenous antibiotics. If they become seriously ill, they may require treatment in intensive care.
Other treatments may be given depending on the infection; for example, people with necrotising fasciitis may have emergency surgery to remove infected areas. These infections also need to be reported to the public health team, so they can investigate any outbreaks.
Close contacts of someone with an invasive Group A streptococcal infection
These people may sometimes be offered preventative antibiotics. This will be decided upon by the public health team investigating the outbreak. There is debate about whether or not preventative antibiotics are actually useful in this situation, and the scientific evidence is not clear.
What other problems can strep A cause?
Strep A infection can also cause a series of delayed problems that develop after the initial infection. Some of these used to be common in the UK and elsewhere, but are much rarer now; the reason for this is not fully clear. It might relate to better hygiene, increased use of antibiotics, or changes in the types of strep A bacteria that are found in the population.
These problems include:
Rheumatic fever
This is a condition where Group A strep infection triggers an autoimmune reaction, leading to various problems such as heart, joint, and nerve inflammation.
Rheumatic fever has now almost completely disappeared in the UK and most developed countries, but remains a problem in other areas of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Central and South Asia and the South Pacific.
Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis
Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is a kidney problem which seems to be caused by an autoimmune reaction to previous Group A strep infection. This usually gets better on its own, so treatment usually involves managing symptoms and trying to prevent complications, and might include blood pressure control with tablets and antibiotics.
Paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatic disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS)
PANDAS describes a condition where children suddenly develop symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and other mental health problems; one theory is that strep A infection causes an autoimmune problem that leads to PANDAS.
There is controversy around PANDAS; it has been difficult to clearly demonstrate a link between the symptoms and Group A strep infection scientifically, and it may be that these symptoms are not caused by strep A at all in most children. There is also no clear diagnostic test to confirm PANDAS.
What is invasive Group A streptococcal disease?
'Invasive' means any infection with strep A that affects an area of the body where bacteria are not normally found - for example, the lungs (pneumonia) or blood (septicaemia).
People with invasive Group A streptococcal infections become extremely unwell, and these conditions are life-threatening. In the early stages, symptoms and signs of invasive infections can be the same as other, milder illnesses.
It's important to watch for symptoms that suggest serious illness, even if you think (or have been told) that you, or your child, have a minor illness, and that you seek medical attention urgently if they develop.
Invasive GAS can cause infections including:
Pneumonia
Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs. People with pneumonia may have a fever and a cough, but also tend to develop other symptoms which suggest serious infection, such as:
Difficulty breathing - breathing harder and faster, or feeling very out of breath when doing minor tasks, or feeling out of breath whilst resting.

Chest pain, particularly pain that is worse on taking a deep breath.

Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS)
This is a condition where strep A bacteria release a toxin into the blood, leading to dangerously low blood pressure and organ failure. (Toxic shock syndrome can also be caused by a different bacterium, called Staphylococcus aureus.)
In the early stages of toxic shock syndrome, the symptoms can be identical to mild illnesses such as flu - fever, muscle pain, and chills - but rapidly get worse. People with toxic shock syndrome may have:
A sudden high fever.

Necrotising fasciitis
This is a rare but very serious infection under the skin, causing the skin and soft tissues beneath (such as fat and muscle) to die. Necrotising fasciitis is sometimes called 'flesh-eating bacteria'.
Necrotising fasciitis, in its early stages, can be difficult to tell apart from much more common, and less serious, skin infections, as it typically starts with pain, redness, and swelling of the skin, especially around a wound. Later symptoms include:
Pain that is much worse than expected, given the appearance of the skin infection.

Why have strep A cases spiked?
In December 2022, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reported a spike in the number of strep A infections reported in the UK, including reports of scarlet fever, invasive Group A streptococcus infection, and, tragically, deaths of young children as a result of invasive streptococcal infection.
Strep A infections typically come in waves. The last high season for strep A infections in the UK, before 2022, was in 2017/18. During that time, four children under 10 died from invasive Group A streptococcus infection.
In previous years, outbreaks have tended to peak around March to April; rates in the UK in December were unusually high for that time of year.
The exact reasons for this are not entirely clear yet. Some theories include:
Scarlet fever rates dropped significantly in 2020/21. It's likely that infection control measures designed to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as lockdowns, school closures and social distancing, also prevented Group A streptococcus infections from spreading. A larger number than usual of children may not have built up immunity to Group A streptococcus infections as a result, meaning there were more children who could become infected with, and spread, the infection.

Lots of viral infections, such as RSV, influenza and COVID-19 were also going around at the same time, and exposure to these illnesses might have (temporarily) made children more vulnerable to catching Group A streptococcus, and potentially becoming seriously ill with it.

There does not seem to be any evidence that the type of strep A bacteria circulating had become more aggressive, or otherwise more likely to cause serious disease themselves.

Meets Patient’s editorial guidelines
There are various strains of E. coli germs (bacteria). Many strains are usually harmless and live in the gut of healthy people. However, some strains are a cause of common infections such as urine infections and gut infections (gastroenteritis). A strain called VTEC O157 is an uncommon cause of infection, but it can be serious. It can lead to a severe gut infection with bloody diarrhoea.
Always contact your doctor immediately if you or your child have any bloody diarrhoea, even just one single episode.
Also, the poison (toxin) released by VTEC O157 can cause other serious diseases such as haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The majority of people fully recover from a VTEC O157 infection. However, in a few people, it can be fatal.

What is E. coli?
Escherichia coli (abbreviated to E. coli) is a germ (bacterium). There are many strains (subtypes) of E. coli bacteria. Many strains live in the gut of healthy people and animals. They usually do no harm there and are one of the normal bugs (bacteria) found in the gut. However, some strains of E. coli can cause various infections and diseases (see below).

Recently, there has been concern that some strains of E. coli can produce small proteins (enzymes) called extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). These enzymes are significant because, when they are produced by the bacteria, they can make the bacteria resistant to certain antibiotic medicines such as penicillins, cephalosporins, trimethoprim and tetracycline.
This means that the bacteria can continue to multiply, causing more severe infection and becoming more difficult to treat.
What infections and diseases can be caused by E. coli?
These include the following:
Urinary tract infections (UTIs)
For example, cystitis, kidney infections and other 'urine infections'. These are the most common infections caused by E. coli. About 9 in 10 UTIs are caused by strains of E.coli.
Many of the strains are those that live harmlessly in the gut but can cause a UTI if they get into the bladder or other parts of the urinary tract. For details see separate leaflets called Cystitis (Urine Infection) in Women, Urine Infection in Men, Urine Infection in Older People, Kidney Infection (Pyelonephritis), and Urine Infection in Children.
Infection of the gut (gastroenteritis)
This is commonly due to various strains that do not normally live in the gut. Gastroenteritis can cause symptoms of diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), high temperature (fever) and tummy (abdominal) pain.
The source of the infecting strains is often from contaminated food ('food poisoning') or from other people who have the infection. Traveller's diarrhoea is often caused by a strain of E. coli. See separate leaflets called Gastroenteritis in Children, Gastroenteritis, Food Poisoning and Traveller's Diarrhoea for further details.
Intra-abdominal infections
These are infections that occur inside the abdomen, often when a part of the gut is damaged or perforated. This allows the normally harmless E. coli germs (bacteria) that live in the gut to get into the abdomen and cause infection. For example, the following can occur after a burst appendix or following a stab wound to the abdomen:
Inflammation of the thin layer of tissue lining the abdomen (the peritoneum). This is called peritonitis.
Inflammation of the thin layer of tissue lining the abdomen (the peritoneum). This is called peritonitis.
An abdominal collection of pus (an abscess).

Other infections
Other infections that are sometimes caused by strains of E. coli include:
Inflammation of lung tissue (pneumonia).
Inflammation of lung tissue (pneumonia).
Inflammation around the brain (meningitis).

Infected bones (osteomyelitis).

Infected joints (septic arthritis).

Skin and soft tissue infections (especially in people who have diabetes).
Skin and soft tissue infections (especially in people who have diabetes).
So, in fact, practically any area of the body can be infected with E. coli, although some areas are only rarely infected.
Other diseases
Other diseases associated with E. coli include haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). These are rare but serious diseases that occur as a result of a poison (toxin) that some strains of E. coli make.
The most important toxin-releasing strain is called 'vero cytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157'. This is sometimes called VTEC O157 or E. coli O157.
The rest of this leaflet is just about VTEC O157.
What is E Coli O157?
VTEC strains of E. coli make poisons (toxins) that can cause severe illness. The toxins are called vero cytotoxins (VTs). There are various VTEC strains that can cause disease in humans but the most important one is VTEC O157. Although VTEC O157 is uncommon, it has caused several outbreaks of disease in recent years in the UK.
E Coli O157 symptoms
VTEC O157 can cause a range of symptoms - from none at all to a severe life-threatening illness. It can take anywhere between 1 and 14 days to develop symptoms once you are infected, but most commonly it takes 3-4 days. Conditions caused by this bacteria include:
Infection of the gut (gastroenteritis)
Some people infected with VTEC O157 have typical symptoms of gastroenteritis. That is:
Diarrhoea with or without being sick (vomiting).
Diarrhoea with or without being sick (vomiting).
Tummy (abdominal) cramps.
Tummy (abdominal) cramps.
High temperature (fever).
High temperature (fever).
Sometimes there is some blood mixed in with the diarrhoea. This may last a few days and clear within a week or so, just like many other cases of gastroenteritis. However the infection may also cause a very serious illness needing treatment in hospital.
Always contact your doctor immediately if you or your child has any bloody diarrhoea, even just one single episode.
Haemorrhagic colitis
A number of people infected with VTEC O157 develop a very inflamed large bowel (colon) which bleeds a lot. This causes very bloody (haemorrhagic) diarrhoea and abdominal pains (which can be severe). Often there is no fever with haemorrhagic colitis.
Symptoms can be bad for several days and then usually gradually lessen (subside). Symptoms typically clear completely within two weeks. In effect, it is like a severe bout of gastroenteritis. The infection can be particularly severe, and sometimes even fatal, in young children and the elderly.
Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS)
Between 1 and 2 in 10 people infected with VTEC O157 develop HUS in addition to gastroenteritis or haemorrhagic colitis. HUS is a condition that is triggered by the poison (toxin) made by VTEC O157.
It causes kidney failure, a type of anaemia called haemolytic anaemia (anaemia caused by damage to the red blood cells), and thrombocytopenia (lowered platelets which can lead to spontaneous bleeding).
HUS usually develops about 7 to 10 days after the diarrhoea. It most commonly develops in young children or the elderly. Severe illness can develop and about 1 in 10 children who develop HUS will die of the condition.
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
Some people (mainly adults) infected with VTEC O157 develop TTP. This can cause serious problems in the blood, kidneys and brain. Some people can die of this condition.
Asymptomatic carriage
This means that some people can 'carry' the VTEC O157 in their gut for a time but without having any symptoms. However, if you carry the germs (bacteria) in your gut you will pass it out with your stools (faeces) for a time. Therefore, even if you do not have symptoms, you can pass on the bacteria to others if your hygiene is poor, eg, ineffective hand-washing after going to the toilet.
How do you get E Coli O157?
VTEC O157 is found in the gut and stools (faeces) of many animals, including cattle and sheep. You can become infected by eating food that is contaminated with VTEC O157, including undercooked or raw meat. There have also been some outbreaks of infection linked to handling or petting such animals on farms or in sanctuaries.
VTEC O157 is an uncommon germ (bacterium) to contaminate food but, when it does, the consequences can be serious. A number of outbreaks of disease caused by VTEC O157 have been reported in recent years. Outbreaks have been reported where the contaminated food has been:
Beef and beef products, such as undercooked beefburgers.

Cheese.

If you have been infected with VTEC O157, you will pass it out with your stools, sometimes for several weeks, even after symptoms have gone. Therefore, some people pass on the germs (bacteria) to others if their hygiene is poor. For example, not washing hands after going to the toilet, and then preparing food for others.
Swimming in contaminated water has also resulted in small outbreaks of VTEC O157. Drinking water that has not been treated to remove bacteria can also be a source of infection.
What testing method is used to diagnose E Coli O157?
If infection with VTEC O157 is suspected then a sample of your stools (faeces) is usually taken. Tests in the laboratory can confirm the presence of VTEC O157 germs (bacteria). A blood test may also be able to look for VTEC O157 infection by detecting antibodies that your body has made against the bacteria.
E Coli O157 treatment
There is no cure for infection with VTEC O157. However, in most cases, it causes either infection of the gut (gastroenteritis) or haemorrhagic colitis, which is like severe gastroenteritis but with bleeding (haemorrhage). These illnesses usually clear away by themselves as your immune system clears the germs (bacteria).
Staying hydrated
The main treatment is to make sure that you do not become lacking in fluid in the body (dehydrated). So, it is important to drink plenty and some people may need a 'drip' to correct low body fluid. For details of what fluids to drink and how much, see the separate leaflets called Diarrhoea and Acute Diarrhoea in Children.
Medicines
Antibiotic medicines are not usually used to treat this infection. Indeed, there is some concern that giving antibiotics to children who have gastroenteritis or colitis caused by VTEC O157 may increase their risk of developing HUS.
You should also avoid taking any antidiarrhoeal medicines such as loperamide if you have VTEC O157. One of the reasons for this is that they may also possibly increase the risk of HUS. Medicines known as 'non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs', such as ibuprofen, should also be avoided because they may have effects on your kidney function if you have VTEC O157.
Paracetamol can be used to help with pain relief or high temperature (fever). See also the separate leaflet called Diarrhoea Medicine.
People who develop HUS or TTP need specialist hospital care. This aims to control the effects of the disease until the poison (toxin) and bacteria have gone from the body.
How to prevent the spread of E Coli O157
VTEC O157 is highly infectious. It only takes a few germs (bacteria) to cause illness. If you are infected with VTEC O157, or your child is, in order to reduce the chance of passing on the infection to others, the following are recommended until symptoms go:
Wash your hands thoroughly after going to the toilet. Ideally, use liquid soap in warm running water, but any soap is better than none. Dry properly after washing. If your child is infected and wears nappies, be especially careful to wash your hands after changing nappies and before preparing, serving, or eating food.

If your child is infected and wears nappies, be especially careful to wash your hands after changing nappies and before preparing, serving, or eating food.
If a potty has to be used for an infected child, wear gloves when you handle it and dispose of the contents into a toilet. Then wash the potty with hot water and detergent and leave it to dry.

Regularly clean the toilets that you use, with disinfectant. With hot water and detergent, wipe the flush handle, toilet seat, bathroom taps, surfaces and door handles at least once a day. Keep a cloth just for cleaning the toilet (or use a disposable one each time).

If you work with vulnerable people such as young children, the unwell or the elderly, or you work with food, you should inform your employer that you have VTEC O157. Your doctor should also speak to public health authorities so that a decision can be made as to when it is safe for you to return to work. You may be asked to provide further stool samples to confirm that the infection has cleared. The same applies to young children who attend nurseries and schools. Further tests may also be required to determine when it is safe for them to return. This will usually be arranged by an occupational health doctor, working for your employer.

If you have come into contact with someone who has confirmed VTEC O157 and you work with vulnerable people as described above or if you handle food, you should also inform your employer and get advice from your doctor. You may need to stay away from work until the results of a stool test are available to ensure that you do not have the infection.
Children under the age of 5 years who have confirmed VTEC O157 should not swim in swimming pools or share paddling pools with other people until they have been tested to show that their infection has cleared.
What is the outlook (prognosis)?
As mentioned above, the problems that can occur if you are infected with VTEC O157 can range from no symptoms at all, to a life-threatening illness. Many infected people get a nasty gut infection, but then fully recover. Typically, symptoms will clear within two weeks, except in those people who develop HUS or TTP. These complications can last much longer.
Some people have died from VTEC O157 infection in recent years, usually as a result of HUS or TTP. For example, in 1997 it caused the death of 20 people in Scotland.
Can E Coli O157 infection be prevented?
Proper storage, preparation and cooking of food, as well as good hygiene, help to prevent VTEC O157 infection (and other gut infections). In particular, always wash your hands and dry them thoroughly, and teach children to wash and dry theirs:
After going to the toilet (and after changing nappies or helping an older child to go to the toilet).

If you smoke, you should also wash your hands before smoking. The simple measure of washing and drying hands regularly and properly is known to make a big difference to the chance of developing many infections, including VTEC O157.
To reduce your chance of VTEC O157 infection, you should also avoid eating undercooked meat and drinking unpasteurised milk or untreated water. Also avoid swimming in water that may be contaminated, such as ponds, streams or lakes.
