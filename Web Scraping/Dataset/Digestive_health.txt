Trapped wind is common and happens when gas builds up in the stomach or intestines, causing bloating, burping, or farting. Everyone has a certain amount of gas in the gut but for some people, larger amounts of gas are produced. In this leaflet we discuss what causes trapped wind and how to relieve trapped wind and bloating.

Key points
Trapped wind is common and happens when gas builds up in the stomach or intestines and can’t pass easily. It causes bloating, sharp or crampy tummy pains, burping, and farting.

What is trapped wind?
Diagram naming the parts of the gut
There is always a certain amount of gas in the bowel. Most of this comes from air swallowed whilst you eat or drink. It can also happen during smoking or when swallowing saliva. Larger amounts can be swallowed when you eat quickly, gulp down a drink or chew gum. The swallowed air goes down into the gullet (the oesophagus).
If you are sitting up, the air tends to go back up the oesophagus and escapes again through the mouth in the process of burping. If you are lying flat, the air tends to pass downwards causing gas in the stomach. This can result in bloating after eating and a hard, swollen tummy. The gas eventually enters the small bowel (small intestine) and escapes through the bottom. People often refer to this as 'farting' or, more politely, 'passing wind'/'passing gas', or flatulence.
Gas can also be produced due to germs (bacteria) acting on partially digested food in the gut. This is more likely to happen with some foods than others. Broccoli, baked beans and Brussels sprouts are well-known culprits. The number of germs in the bowel also has an effect on the volume of gas produced. The gas that is made is mainly composed of carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. It may contain traces of a chemical called sulphur. This is responsible for the unpleasant smell experienced when you pass wind through the back passage.
Abdominal bloating is the term used when the tummy feels blown out, tight or full of gas. It results in a swollen stomach and the waistband of a skirt or a pair of trousers may feel uncomfortable. You may experience crampy tummy pains.

Gas sometimes settles in the curves of the large bowel (large intestine) under the liver or spleen. This can cause pain in the upper right or upper left areas of your tummy.
Most people who are bothered by these types of symptoms do not actually produce more gas than usual, they are just more sensitive to normal amounts. However, it is now considered that some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) do produce larger than normal volumes of gas. Irritable bowel syndrome is a condition in which bouts of tummy pain are associated with bloating and changes in bowel habit such as constipation and diarrhoea.
Just to complicate matters further, the amount of bloating does not relate to the seriousness of the cause. People with irritable bowel syndrome may complain of severe bloating, whilst in those with coeliac disease the bloating may be mild, moderate or severe.
What causes trapped wind?
Trapped wind is caused when there is too much gas in your digestive system. Reasons why you might have a larger than normal amounts of gas in the tummy include the following:
Swallowing too much air
This is called aerophagia. You may not be aware of it but you may be swallowing air frequently or in large amounts. This often happens in people who are under stress. It can be aggravated by chewing gum and smoking. Usually, air swallowed in this way passes into the gullet (oesophagus) and down into the stomach.
However, sometimes air is sucked into the back of the throat (the pharynx) and is burped out before it reaches the oesophagus. This is known as supragastric belching.
Some people swallow air deliberately to cause belching, as they find this helps to relieve symptoms of indigestion.
Diet
Foods which are well known to cause excessive wind in the gut include:

Starchy foods such as potatoes, corn and noodles.
Starchy foods such as potatoes, corn and noodles.
Foods high in soluble fibre (for example fruit, peas and beans).
Foods high in soluble fibre (for example fruit, peas and beans).
Lactose intolerance
Lactose intolerance happens when your body has difficulty digesting lactose. Lactose is present in milk and foods which are made with milk. Lactose intolerance causes diarrhoea, stomach ache and bloating.
Intolerance to food sugars
Intolerance to sugars in certain foods can occur. Fructose intolerance is the most common. Foods high in fructose include dried fruit, honey, sucrose, onions and artichokes. Sorbitol is another sugar to which you can be intolerant. It is found in chewing gum and 'sugar-free' sweets.
Medicines
Check the leaflet of any medicines you are taking, as wind, gas or bloating can be side-effects. Metformin (a medicine for diabetes) and lactulose (a laxative) are well known to cause these symptoms. Antacids such as magnesium trisilicate help to combat indigestion but they can increase the amount of carbon dioxide produced in the stomach, and aggravate belching.
Diseases causing increased gas
Most people with gas-related symptoms have increased sensitivity to gas or have one of the causes of increased gas production mentioned above. However, occasionally these symptoms can be caused by diseases of the bowel. Sometimes, the illness can be short-lived. For example, acute gastroenteritis (also known as a 'tummy bug'), often caused by infection with a virus, can result in a short-term condition associated with increased gas.
Occasionally, gas-related symptoms can be features of long-term diseases. All of them can cause at least one gas-related symptom (i.e. tummy pain, excess wind or bloating).
Examples include:
Coeliac disease is caused by intolerance to a protein called gluten which is found in certain foods containing wheat, barley and rye. It principally affects the part of the gut called the small intestine. It can occur at any age. Symptoms are relieved by avoiding gluten-containing foods.
The most common inflammatory bowel diseases are ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis is a disease in which inflammation develops in the colon and the rectum (the large intestine). Crohn's disease is a condition that causes inflammation of the wall of the gut (gastrointestinal tract). Any part of the gut can be affected. The main symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases are tummy pains and diarrhoea, but bloating and other gas-related symptoms can develop.
Diverticulitis occurs when small pouches in the wall of the large bowel ('diverticula') become infected.
Short bowel syndrome can be a complication of bowel surgery. If more than half the small bowel is removed during surgery this can cause difficulties in food absorption.
Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is a poorly understood condition which is caused by an overgrowth of germs in the small intestine. It can be an aftermath of bowel surgery, and also occurs more frequently in people with diabetes, inflammatory diseases of the bowel and diverticulosis.
It may be associated with irritable bowel syndrome and can cause the same sort of symptoms, particularly bloating. Indeed, it is thought that some cases of irritable bowel syndrome may be caused by small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is sometimes treated with antibiotics such as metronidazole.
Scleroderma is a condition which causes thickening of the skin and sometimes the internal organs. When the gut is affected it can cause problems in stomach emptying and irregularity of bowel movement. This can lead to bloating, constipation and diarrhoea.
Ovarian cancer is mentioned here because, although cancer of the ovary is not a disease of the bowel, it can cause symptoms which can be confused with bowel disease. These can include feeling full quickly or loss of appetite, tummy pains and bloating.
This is caused by infection with a germ called giardia. One of the symptoms is belching up foul-smelling gas.
Do I need any tests for trapped wind or bloating?
Most people with these symptoms do not need any tests. However, you may need tests if you have more worrying symptoms. These can include:
Persistent diarrhoea.

How to get rid of trapped wind
There are several remedies that you can try that help relieve trapped wind and stop bloating. These include:
Changes to your diet
It is known that there are some foods that make you bloated. Cutting down on these triggers will promote bloating relief.
Keep a record of the foods and drinks you have and drink to see if there are any foods or beverages which could be associated with your symptoms. These can include milk and milk products, certain fruits and vegetables, whole grains, artificial sweeteners and fizzy drinks. Pulses, bran and fruit contain fermentable carbohydrates, sugars which are easily broken down by the digestive system.
Not only do fermentable carbohydrates cause excess gas, but they also work with germs to cause tooth decay. Reducing your intake of the fermentable carbohydrates found in sugary foods can result in several health benefits.
If you are lactose-intolerant you will need to avoid lactose-containing foods. Talk to your doctor to find out how best to do this without developing complications such as calcium and mineral deficiency.
If you are fructose-intolerant you should avoid fructose-containing foods. Fructose is used as a sweetener in many processed foods; look for 'high in fructose corn syrup' on the label.
Live micro-organisms (probiotics) may be helpful, although the evidence is not conclusive. Probiotics are 'gut-friendly' germs (bacteria) such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. The specific strain of bacteria may be important but, on current evidence, it is difficult to advise which strain(s) to use.
Diets which combat constipation may be helpful. For example, soluble fibre such as linseed (up to one tablespoon daily) and oats are recommended.
Exercise
Exercise has been shown to improve gas-related symptoms. This is partly due to the upright position, as lying flat tends to stop gas from moving round the body.
One word of warning: excessive flatulence and belching are common in female runners. The cause for this is unknown.
Over-the-counter medicines
The treatment for trapped wind, gas and bloating is dietary changes and exercise, plus treatment for any underlying cause. There is otherwise no good evidence for any particular medicine but the following may be tried:
Simeticone for bloating. It is usually sold in combination with an antacid. Simeticone is also used for colic in babies and infants. Simeticone has not been found to be helpful in bloating related to irritable bowel syndrome.

Medicines which encourage the movement of the gut (prokinetic medicines) can assist with bloating relief. They can be quite helpful as bloated stomach remedies if you have excessive belching and bloating. Most of these are prescription-only preparations but peppermint can be bought in various forms.

Deodorising products
Carbon fibre underwear appears to be effective but is expensive. Charcoal pads and cushions are cheaper but may not be as effective.
Psychological therapies
These may be useful for people who have a low tolerance to a normal amount of gas in the stomach. Therapies which may help include mindfulness and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Psychological therapies may also be helpful for people who have excessive belching, particularly where aerophagy is the cause. Aerophagy can also sometimes be helped by a speech therapist.
Frequently asked questions
How long can trapped wind last?
Trapped wind usually passes within a few hours, but in some cases it can last a day or two. You should see a doctor if your symptoms continue or get worse.
Can you release trapped gas by pressing on your stomach?
Massaging your stomach can help move trapped gas and relieve pain. Starting at the lower right side of your stomach, gently massage the area in a circular motion, moving up, across to the left, and then down, following the natural path of your intestines.
What sleeping position relieves trapped wind?
Lying on your left side with your knees slightly bent can help trapped wind move through your intestines and relieve discomfort whilst you sleep.

IBS stands for irritable bowel syndrome, and it is a long-term chronic condition of the gut (bowel) that causes episodes of tummy (abdominal) cramps, bloating and either constipation or diarrhoea. IBS is a problem with how the bowel works.

What is IBS?
IBS stands for irritable bowel syndrome and may not cause any harm to your body but sometimes causes a lot of discomfort. It isn't known exactly what causes IBS, but it is thought it may be due to various factors affecting the nervous system and microbiome of the bowels. The symptoms can range from mild to severe. There is no cure for IBS but some simple lifestyle changes and treatments usually make the symptoms much better.
What causes IBS?
Exactly what causes IBS isn't known. It may have something to do with overactivity of part or parts of the gut (bowel) within the digestive system.
Food is passed along the bowel by regular squeezes (contractions) of the muscles in the wall of the bowel wall. Pain and other symptoms may develop if the contractions become abnormal or overactive. The area of overactivity in the gut may determine exactly where you feel the pain and whether constipation or diarrhoea develops.
The cause of overactivity in parts of the gut is not clear. One or more of the following may play a part:
Overactivity of the nerves or muscles of the gut. It is not known why this may occur. It may have something to do with overactivity of messages sent from the nervous system to the gut. Stress or emotional upset may play a role. About half of people with IBS can relate the start of symptoms to a stressful event in their lives. Symptoms tend to become worse during times of stress, depression and anxiety.

Infection and germs (bacteria) in the gut. IBS is not caused by an ongoing gut infection. However, in some cases, the onset of symptoms seems to follow a bout of a gut infection with diarrhoea and being sick (vomiting), called gastroenteritis. So, perhaps a virus or other germ may sensitise or trigger the gut in some way to cause persisting symptoms of IBS.

In recent years there has been increasing interest in the links between the gut microbiome, the brain and IBS. The microbiome is the combination of bugs (eg, bacteria and viruses) that are found in the gut. Patients with IBS have a different microbiome pattern to those without IBS. The connections between the gut and the brain are known as the 'gut-brain axis' and it is this link which has led to the use of psychological therapies sometimes being used to treat IBS.

What are the symptoms of IBS?
The symptoms of IBS vary from person to person.
They include:
Pain and discomfort
This may occur in different parts of the tummy (abdomen). Pain usually comes and goes. The length and severity of each bout of pain can vary greatly. The pain often eases when you pass stools (faeces) or wind. Many people with IBS describe the pain as a spasm or colic.
Bloating
Bloating and swelling of your tummy which may develop from time to time. You may pass more wind than usual.
Changes in stools:
Some people have bouts of diarrhoea, some have bouts of constipation and some get a combination of both.

Some people have occasional mild symptoms. Others have unpleasant long-term symptoms. Many people fall somewhere in between, with flare-ups of symptoms from time to time. Some doctors group people with IBS into one of three categories:
Those with abdominal pain or discomfort, and the other symptoms are mainly bloating and constipation.

However, in practice, many people will not fall neatly into any one category, and considerable overlap occurs.
Note: remember that passing blood is not a symptom of IBS. You should tell a doctor if you pass blood or have other 'red flag' symptoms such as weight loss, difficulty in swallowing, and vomiting.
How common is IBS?
IBS is common. It is thought to affect about 1 in 5 people in the UK at some time in their lives. In IBS, the function of the gut is upset, yet all parts of the gut look normal, even when looked at under a microscope. IBS can affect anyone at any age but it most often first develops in young adults and tends to be more common in those with a family history of IBS. Women are affected more often than men.
How is IBS diagnosed?
There is no test that confirms the diagnosis of IBS. A doctor can usually diagnose IBS from the typical symptoms, and tests are used to rule out other conditions.
Your doctor will check that there is nothing else going on. Usually this will include an examination of your tummy (abdomen) and back passage (rectum) and some simple tests.
A blood test and stool (faeces) test are often taken to help rule out other conditions (see below). The tests that are often considered to rule out these conditions include:
Full blood count (FBC) - to rule out lack of iron in the blood (anaemia), which is associated with various gut (bowel) disorders.
Full blood count (FBC) - to rule out lack of iron in the blood (anaemia), which is associated with various gut (bowel) disorders.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) - which can show if there is inflammation in the body (which does not occur with IBS).

A stool test called a FIT test may also be used to check whether you have any bleeding from your bowel, which may be a sign of bowel cancer.
More complicated tests such as gastroscopy or colonoscopy (to look into the bowel with a special telescope) are not usually needed. However, they may be done if symptoms are not typical, or if you develop symptoms of IBS in later life (over the age of about 50) when other conditions need to be ruled out.
What else could it be?
Some conditions produce symptoms which can be confused with IBS. These include:
Crohn's disease (inflammatory bowel disease).

IBS does not cause colon cancer, but a person who has IBS may develop colon cancer later in life. A key factor in colon cancer is inflammation, and while IBS does cause pain and discomfort, it doesn't cause inflammation.
It is therefore important that patients with IBS report new symptoms, or a change in their symptoms, to their doctors, particularly worrying ones such as bleeding, even if they have been treated for IBS for many years.
How to treat IBS
There are many different methods of treating IBS. All will have an effect on some people, but none will help in every person with IBS.
Many people with mild IBS symptoms don't need any treatment. No treatment is likely to take away symptoms completely; however, treatment can often ease symptoms and improve your bowel habits and quality of life.
What lifestyle changes can help alleviate IBS symptoms?
Exercise. Regular exercise is known to help to ease symptoms.

Keeping a symptom diary. It may help to keep a food and lifestyle diary for 2-4 weeks to monitor symptoms and activities. Note everything that you eat and drink, times that you were stressed, weight loss and when you took any formal exercise. This may identify triggers, such as a food, alcohol, or emotional stress and may show if exercise helps to ease or to prevent symptoms.

Home remedies for IBS
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that people with IBS might want to try probiotics, which can be bought over the counter. They should be tried for twelve weeks whilst monitoring the effect.
What is the best diet for IBS?
Some people with IBS find that certain foods can trigger symptoms or make symptoms worse, and benefit from a low FODMAP diet. See the separate leaflet called IBS diet sheet for more details.
Irritable bowel syndrome medications
Antispasmodic medicines for tummy (abdominal) pain
These are medicines that relax the muscles in the wall of the gut. There are several types of antispasmodics - for example, alverine citrate, mebeverine, hyoscine and peppermint oil. The pain may ease with medication but may not go away completely.
Treating constipation
Constipation is sometimes a main symptom of IBS. If so, it may help if you increase the soluble fibre in your diet. Sometimes laxatives are advised for short periods if increasing fibre is not enough to ease a troublesome bout of constipation. It is best to avoid lactulose if you have IBS.
A medicine called linaclotide works in a completely different way to other medicines for treating constipation. It has been shown to reduce pain, bloating and constipation symptoms.
Treating diarrhoea
An antidiarrhoeal medicine (for example, loperamide) may be useful if diarrhoea is a main symptom. The dose of loperamide needed to control diarrhoea varies considerably.
Treating bloating
Peppermint oil may help with bloating and wind. For some people peppermint oil (or peppermint tea) also helps with tummy (abdominal) pains and spasms.
Antidepressant medicines
A tricyclic antidepressant is sometimes used to treat IBS. An example is amitriptyline. Tricyclic antidepressants are used in a variety of painful conditions, including IBS. SSRI antidepressant medicines (for example, fluoxetine) can also be used for IBS. They may work by affecting the way you feel pain.
Alternative IBS treatments
Psychological therapies
Any stressful situation (for example, family problems, work stress, examinations) may trigger symptoms of IBS in some people. Examples of psychological therapies are cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), hypnotherapy and psychotherapy. Psychological therapies can be very effective for some people with IBS.
What is the outlook for IBS (prognosis)?
IBS usually causes symptoms long-term and often stays with you for the rest of your life. However, the symptoms tend to come and go. You may have long spells without any symptoms, or may have only mild symptoms.
Treatment can often help to ease symptoms when they flare up. IBS often improves with time and, in some cases, symptoms clear up for good at some stage.

Gastroenteritis, also known as 'stomach-flu', is the inflammation of the stomach and intestines, caused by viruses, bacteria or other microbes. It causes symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Most cases are mild and improve on their own, however, dehydration can occur.
This leaflet explains the causes, symptoms, treatment, and prevention of gastroenteritis.

What is gastroenteritis?
Gastroenteritis is an infection of the gut with microbes, which usually causes a mild tummy upset for a day or two. It can also be called 'stomach flu'.
However, there is a more severe form of gastroenteritis that sticks around for several days. Apart from the watery poo and throwing up, you get blood in the poo and tummy pains for no extra charge. Sometimes a high temperature (fever), aching limbs and headache are added extras.
There is a separate article on Gastroenteritis in children.
Gastroenteritis symptoms
Diarrhoea and being sick (vomiting) are the two main symptoms of gastroenteritis. This may cause lack of fluid in the body (dehydration), so consult a doctor quickly if you suspect you are becoming dehydrated.
Signs of dehydration
Mild dehydration is a common gastroenteritis symptom and is usually easily reversed by drinking lots of fluids. Severe dehydration can be fatal unless quickly treated because the organs of your body need a certain amount of fluid to function.
Symptoms and signs of dehydration in adults include:

What causes gastroenteritis?
Gastroenteritis can be caused by:
Viruses: Infection with noroviruses and adenoviruses are common causes of gastroenteritis in adults in the UK. However, other viruses can also be the cause.

Parasites: Poisons (toxins) produced by bacteria can also cause food poisoning. Another group of microbes called parasites can also be a cause. Food and Water contaminated by bacteria or other microbes is another common cause, particularly in countries with poor sanitation. See the separate leaflet called Food Poisoning for more details.

Is gastroenteritis contagious?
Yes, gastroenteritis is contagious so it can be easily passed on from person to person. You can catch gastroenteritis when tiny particles of faeces or vomit from an infected person enter your mouth.
There are a number of ways this can happen:
By touching contaminated surfaces and then your mouth or face.

By close contact with an infected person, as their breath may contain small particles of vomit carrying the virus or bacteria that causes gastroenteritis.
By close contact with an infected person, as their breath may contain small particles of vomit carrying the virus or bacteria that causes gastroenteritis.
Viruses are easily spread from one person to another by close contact. This is often because of the virus being present on people's hands after they have been to the toilet. Surfaces or objects touched by the infected person can also allow transmission of the virus.
The virus can also be passed on if the infected person prepares food. Outbreaks of a virus causing gastroenteritis in many people can occur - for example, in schools, hospitals or nursing homes
People with gastroenteritis are most contagious from the moment their symptoms begin to 48 hours after they've gone away. However, they may be infections slightly before and after this period.
Can food poisoning cause gastroenteritis?
Even when we are not in contact with someone with gastroenteritis, we can still catch it from poor storage, preparation and cooking of food, so good hygiene can help to prevent gastroenteritis too.
In particular, always wash your hands:
After you go to the toilet.

After playing with pets (even healthy animals can carry certain harmful bacteria).
The simple measure of washing hands regularly and properly is known to make a big difference to the chance of developing gastroenteritis.
You should also take extra measures when in countries which have poor sanitation. For example, avoid drinking contaminated water and other drinks that may not be safe and avoid eating food washed in unsafe water.
Is gastroenteritis dangerous?
Gastroenteritis can become dangerous if you become dehydrated, you're throwing up a lot and can't keep fluids down, you have blood in your poo or sick (vomit), or you have severe tummy pains. If this happens, seek medical advice.
A persistent high temperature (fever) or diarrhoea or puking that lasts longer than expected are other reasons to contact the doc. Also, if you're elderly, have a long-term condition such as diabetes, are pregnant or have trouble with your immune system, don't hesitate to get in touch with a health professional.
Gastroenteritis is common. About 1 in 5 people in the UK will develop an episode of gastroenteritis in a year. Most people have a mild form of gastroenteritis and do not need to seek medical advice or to visit their doctor.
The main symptom is diarrhoea, often with being sick (vomiting) as well. Diarrhoea means loose or watery stools (faeces), usually at least three times in 24 hours. Blood or mucus can appear in the stools with some infections.

Can gastroenteritis have long-term effects?
If vomiting occurs, it often lasts only a day or so but sometimes longer. Diarrhoea often continues after the vomiting stops and commonly lasts for several days or more. Slightly loose stools may continue for a week or so further before a normal pattern returns. Sometimes the symptoms last longer.
When to see a doctor for gastroenteritis

How is gastroenteritis diagnosed?
Most people with gastroenteritis recognise this from their typical symptoms and they do not usually need to see a doctor or to seek medical advice. Symptoms are often quite mild and commonly get better within a few days without any specific treatment.

However, in some circumstances, you may need to see a doctor when you have gastroenteritis. The doctor may ask you questions about recent travel abroad, if you have been in contact with someone with similar symptoms, or if you have recently taken antibiotic medication or been admitted to hospital. This is to look for possible causes of your gastroenteritis.
The doctor will also usually check you for signs of lack of fluid in the body (dehydration). They may check your temperature, pulse and blood pressure. They may also examine your tummy (abdomen) to look for any tenderness
Tests are not usually needed. However, if you are particularly unwell, have bloody stools (faeces), have recently travelled abroad, are admitted to hospital, or your symptoms are not getting better, your doctor may ask you to collect a stool sample. This can then be examined in the laboratory to look for the cause of the infection
Gastroenteritis treatment
Symptoms often settle within a few days or so as your immune system usually clears the infection. Occasionally, admission to hospital is needed if symptoms are severe, or if complications develop.
The following are commonly advised until symptoms ease.
Fluids - have lots to drink
If you suspect that you are dehydrated, you should contact a doctor.
As a rough guide, drink at least 200 mls after each bout of diarrhoea (after each watery stool).
As a rough guide, drink at least 200 mls after each bout of diarrhoea (after each watery stool).
This extra fluid is in addition to what you would normally drink. For example, an adult will normally drink about two litres a day but more in hot countries. The above advice of 200 mls after each bout of diarrhoea is in addition to this usual amount that you would drink.

If you have been sick (vomited), wait 5-10 minutes and then start drinking again but more slowly. For example, a sip every 2-3 minutes but making sure that your total intake is as described above.

You will need to drink even more if you are dehydrated. A doctor will advise on how much to drink if you are dehydrated.
You will need to drink even more if you are dehydrated. A doctor will advise on how much to drink if you are dehydrated.
For most adults, fluids drunk to keep hydrated should mainly be water. It is best not to have drinks that contain a lot of sugar as they can sometimes make diarrhoea worse.
Rehydration drinks are recommended for people who are frail, or over the age of 60, or who have underlying health problems. They are made from sachets that you can buy from pharmacies. (The sachets are also available on prescription.) You add the contents of the sachet to drinking water. Oral rehydration solutions provide a good balance of water, salts and sugar.
The small amount of sugar and salt helps the water to be absorbed better from the gut (intestines) into the body. They do not stop or reduce diarrhoea. Home-made salt/sugar mixtures are used in developing countries if rehydration drinks are not available but they have to be made carefully, as too much salt can be dangerous. Rehydration drinks are cheap and readily available in the UK and are the best treatment.
Eat as normally as possible
It used to be advised not to eat for a while if you had gastroenteritis. However, now it is advised to eat small, light meals if you can. Be guided by your appetite. You may not feel like food and most adults can do without food for a few days.
Eat food as soon as you are able - but don't stop drinking. If you do feel like eating, avoid fatty, spicy or heavy food at first. Plain foods such as wholemeal bread and rice are good foods to try eating first.
See the separate article What to eat when you have gastroenteritis for more details.
Medication
Antidiarrhoeal medicines are not usually necessary. However, you may wish to reduce the number of trips that you need to make to the toilet. You can buy antidiarrhoeal medicines from pharmacies. The safest and most effective is loperamide.
The adult dose of this is two capsules at first. This is followed by one capsule after each time you pass some diarrhoea up to a maximum of eight capsules in 24 hours. It works by slowing down your gut's activity. You should not take loperamide for longer than five days.
Note: do not give antidiarrhoeal medicines to infants and young children aged less than 12 years. Also, do not use antidiarrhoeal medicines if you pass blood or mucus with the diarrhoea or if you have a high temperature (fever). People with certain conditions should not take loperamide. Therefore, read the leaflet that comes with the medicine to be safe. For example, pregnant women should not take loperamide.
Paracetamol or ibuprofen is useful to ease the distress that might accompany a high temperature or headache.
As explained, if symptoms are severe, or continue for more than several days, your doctor may ask for a sample of the diarrhoea. This is sent to the laboratory to look for infecting microbes (bacteria, parasites, etc).
Sometimes an antibiotic or other treatments are needed if certain bacteria or other infections are found to be the cause. Antibiotics are not needed for gastroenteritis caused by viruses and may even make things worse.
See the separate feature Advice for recovering from gastroenteritis.
Complications of gastroenteritis
Gastroenteritis complications are more likely if you have an ongoing (chronic) condition such as diabetes or if you have a weakened immune system. For example, if you are taking long-term steroid medication or you are having chemotherapy treatment for cancer.
Possible complications include the following:
Lack of fluid (dehydration) and salt (electrolyte) imbalance in your body
This is the most common complication. It occurs if the water and salts that are lost in your stools (faeces), or when you have been sick (vomited), are not replaced by you drinking adequate fluids.
If you can manage to drink plenty of fluids then dehydration is unlikely to occur, or is only likely to be mild and will soon recover as you drink. Severe dehydration can lead to a drop in your blood pressure. This can cause reduced blood flow to your vital organs. If dehydration is not treated, kidney failure may also develop.
Some people who become severely dehydrated need a drip of fluid directly into a vein. This requires admission to hospital.
Reactive complications
Rarely, other parts of the body may react to an infection that occurs in the gut (intestines). This can cause symptoms such as joint inflammation (arthritis), skin inflammation and eye inflammation (either conjunctivitis or uveitis). Reactive complications are uncommon when a virus causes gastroenteritis.
Spread of infection
The infection can spread to other parts of your body such as your bones, joints, or the meninges that surround your brain and spinal cord. This is rare. If it does occur, it is more likely if gastroenteritis is caused by salmonella infection.
Persistent diarrhoea syndromes
Persistent diarrhoea may develop, but this is uncommon.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
IBS is sometimes triggered by a bout of gastroenteritis.
Lactose intolerance
A lactose intolerance can sometimes occur for a while after gastroenteritis. This is known as secondary or acquired lactose intolerance. Your gut lining can be damaged by the episode of gastroenteritis. This leads to lack of a chemical (enzyme) called lactase that is needed to help your body digest a sugar called lactose that is in milk.
Lactose intolerance leads to bloating, tummy (abdominal) pain, wind and watery stools after drinking milk. The condition gets better when the infection is over and the gut lining heals. It is more common in children.
Haemolytic uraemic syndrome
This is another potential complication. It is rare and is usually associated with gastroenteritis caused by a certain type of E. coli infection. It is a serious condition where there is anaemia, a low platelet count in the blood and kidney failure. It is more common in children. If recognised and treated, most people recover well.
Reduced effectiveness of some medicines
During an episode of gastroenteritis, certain medicines that you may be taking for other conditions or reasons may not be as effective. This is because the diarrhoea and/or vomiting means that reduced amounts of the medicines are taken up (absorbed) into your body.
Examples of such medicines are medicines for epilepsy, diabetes and contraception. Speak to your doctor or practice nurse if you are unsure of what to do if you are taking other medicines and have gastroenteritis.
How to prevent gastroenteritis
If you have gastroenteritis, the following are recommended to prevent the spread of infection to others:
Wash your hands thoroughly after going to the toilet. Ideally, use liquid soap and water but any soap is better than none. Dry properly after washing.

Food handlers: if you work with food and develop diarrhoea or vomiting, you must immediately leave the food-handling area. For most, no other measures are needed, other than staying away from work until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea or vomiting. Some special situations may arise and sometimes longer time off is needed. Specialist advice may be needed for some uncommon causes of gastroenteritis. If in doubt, seek advice from your employer or GP.

Frequently asked questions
How long does gastroenteritis last?
Viral gastroenteritis symptoms tend to appear 1-3 days after infection and can vary in severity. Typically, gastroenteritis symptoms last anywhere between a day or two, to up to 14 days.
Is yogurt good for gastroenteritis?
Yoghurt with live and active cultures, and are low in added sugar, may help recovery from gastroenteritis by restoring gut bacteria, but some people may find dairy harder to digest while unwell.
What are the first signs of gastroenteritis?
Early signs of gastroenteritis include nausea, stomach cramps, diarrhoea, vomiting, tiredness, and sometimes a mild fever. Symptoms often start suddenly.
What’s the difference between gastritis vs. gastroenteritis?
Gastritis is inflammation of the stomach lining, whilst gastroenteritis is an infection of the stomach and intestines that often causes diarrhoea and vomiting.

Piles (also known as haemorrhoids) are swollen veins in and around your bottom that can cause bleeding, itching, pain, or a sense of fullness.
They develop when pressure increases in the veins around the bottom, making them swollen and enlarged. Common causes of piles include straining, constipation, pregnancy, ageing, and obesity.

What are piles?
Piles (haemorrhoids) are swollen veins that can cause lumps inside and around your bottom.
They may not cause any symptoms or may cause symptoms such as pain, itching and bleeding during bowel movements. There may be small amounts of bright red blood on your toilet tissue or in the toilet after a bowel movement.
Piles often get better on their own but may need treatment to remove them such as rubber band ligation or surgery.
How do you get piles?
There is a network of small veins (blood vessels) within the lining of the anal canal. These veins sometimes become wider and engorged with more blood than usual. The swollen veins and the overlying tissue may then form into one or more swellings (piles).
Do piles go away on their own?
Piles often get better on their own but may need treatment to remove them such as rubber band ligation or surgery.
Types of piles
Piles can be divided into either internal or external piles. Some people develop internal and external piles at the same time.
Internal piles
Internal piles are deeper and initially form above a point 2-3 cm inside the bottom (anal canal) in the upper part of the anal canal or lower rectum (the last part of the large bowel that connects to the anal canal).
External piles
External piles start off nearer the surface, below a point 2-3 cm inside the bottom.
Despite the name, external piles aren't always seen outside of the opening of the bottom. Equally confusing, internal haemorrhoids can enlarge and drop down (prolapse), so that they hang outside of the bottom.
Whether internal or external, haemorrhoids often don't cause any problems but can cause bleeding and sometimes pain. If they do cause any bleeding or pain then you should seek medical advice.
Strangulated or thrombosed haemorrhoids are uncommon but usually very painful. They are piles that have developed a blood clot within them, causing pain, swelling, and sometimes bleeding. They are most common in external piles.
You may need to be referred for assessment in hospital. Treatments usually include bed rest, medication for pain relief, hot baths, ice packs and keeping your poo soft. Surgery may be needed to remove the haemorrhoid.
Piles symptoms
The most common symptom of piles is bleeding after going to the toilet to poo. The blood is usually bright red and may be noticed on the toilet paper, in the toilet pan or coating the poo. Sometimes there are no symptoms and you may not realise that you have any piles.
What do piles look like?
Piles can look different depending on whether they are internal or external, and what grade they are. You often won't see anything if you have piles and look at the area round your bottom. This is because most piles are inside your bottom and rectum and don't protrude from your bottom.
Larger internal piles may hang down out of your bottom, where they look like a discoloured rubbery lump. An external pile will look like a soft lump on the edge of the opening of your bottom.
Piles (haemorrhoids)
Piles grading
Piles symptoms can vary depending on the size, position and grade of the piles.
Grade 1 piles are small swellings on the inside lining of the anal canal. They cannot be seen or felt from outside the opening of the bottom. Grade 1 piles are common. In some people they enlarge further to grade 2 or more.
Grade 1 piles are small swellings on the inside lining of the anal canal. They cannot be seen or felt from outside the opening of the bottom. Grade 1 piles are common. In some people they enlarge further to grade 2 or more.
Grade 2 piles are larger. They may be partly pushed out from the bottom when you go to the toilet, but quickly go back inside again when you stop straining.
Grade 2 piles are larger. They may be partly pushed out from the bottom when you go to the toilet, but quickly go back inside again when you stop straining.
Grade 3 piles hang out from the bottom (prolapse) when you go to the toilet. You may feel one or more as small, soft lumps that hang from the bottom. However, you can push them back inside the bottom with a finger.
Grade 3 piles hang out from the bottom (prolapse) when you go to the toilet. You may feel one or more as small, soft lumps that hang from the bottom. However, you can push them back inside the bottom with a finger.
Grade 4 piles permanently hang down from within the bottom (prolapse), and you cannot push them back inside. They sometimes become quite large.

Small internal piles are usually painless, because there are no pain-sensitive nerve fibres where they are located. External piles, however, can be itchy or painful. Larger piles may cause a mucous discharge, which may irritate the skin around the bottom.
You may have a sense of fullness in the bottom, or a feeling of not fully emptying when you go to the toilet.
What causes piles?
The lining of the anal canal contains many blood vessels (veins). Changes in the veins within the lining of the canal can cause the pile(s) to develop. The lining and the veins become much larger and this can then cause a swelling and develop into a pile.
There are certain situations that increase the chance of piles developing. These include:
Constipation. Passing large poos, and straining on the toilet. These increase the pressure in and around the veins in the bottom and seem to be a common reason for piles to develop.

Piles treatment
Piles are treated based on their type and severity. Treatment ranges from simple home remedies to surgery for severe cases.
Creams and suppositories
A bland soothing cream, ointment, or suppository may ease discomfort.

One that contains an anaesthetic may ease pain better. You should only use one of these for short periods at a time (5-7 days).

Preparations which contain a corticosteroid for treating piles may be advised by a healthcare professional if there is a lot of inflammation around the piles. This may help to ease itch and pain. You should not normally use a steroid cream or ointment for longer than one week at a time.

Banding treatment (rubber band ligation)
Banding is the most commonly used piles treatment, especially for grade 2 and 3 piles. It may also be done to treat grade 1 piles which have not settled with the simple advice and treatment outlined above.
This surgical procedure is usually done in an outpatient clinic.

In about 8 in 10 cases, the piles are cured by this technique. In about 2 in 10 cases, the piles come back at some stage. (However, you can have a further banding treatment if this occurs.) Piles are less likely to come back after banding if you avoid straining on the toilet and becoming constipated (as described above).
A small number of people have complications following banding, such as bleeding, infection or ulcers forming at the site of a treated haemorrhoid, or urinary problems.
Injection sclerotherapy
Phenol in oil is injected into the tissues at the base of the piles. This causes a scarring (fibrotic) reaction which obliterates the blood vessels going to the piles. The piles then die and drop off, similar to after banding.
Infrared coagulation/photocoagulation
This method of piles treatment uses infrared light to burn and cut off the circulation to the haemorrhoid, which causes it to shrink in size. It may be as effective as banding treatment and injection sclerotherapy for first- and second-degree piles.
Diathermy and electrotherapy
Diathermy and electrotherapy use heat energy to destroy the piles. They appear to have similar success rates as infrared coagulation and the risk of any complications is low.
Haemorrhoidectomy
A surgical procedure to cut away the haemorrhoid(s) is an option to treat grade 3 or 4 piles or for piles not successfully treated by banding or other methods. The operation is done under general anaesthetic and is usually successful. However, it can be quite painful in the days following the operation.
Stapled haemorrhoidopexy
A circular stapling gun is used to cut out a circular section of the lining of the bottom (anal canal) above the piles. This has the effect of pulling the piles back up the bottom.
It also has the effect of reducing the blood supply to the piles and so they shrink as a consequence. Because the cutting is actually above the piles, it is usually a less painful procedure than the traditional operation to remove the piles.
Haemorrhoidal artery ligation
The small arteries that supply blood to the piles are tied (ligated). This causes the haemorrhoid(s) to shrink.
Do I need to see a doctor about piles?
Although piles can often be treated at home, it’s best to see a doctor if you are experiencing any pain or rectal bleeding:

If your doctor is concerned about whether there may be a diagnosis other than piles, or if the piles may need specialist treatment, then your doctor may refer you to a specialist.
How are piles diagnosed?
Piles are usually diagnosed after your doctor asks you questions about your symptoms and performs a physical examination. The examination usually includes an examination of your bottom. Wearing gloves and using a lubricant, your doctor will examine your bottom with their finger to look for any signs of piles or other abnormalities.
Your doctor may suggest a further examination called a proctoscopy. In this procedure, the inside of your bottom is examined using an instrument called a proctoscope. You may be referred to a specialist for more detailed bowel examination (colonoscopy) to help rule out other conditions.
How to prevent piles
You can help prevent piles by avoiding constipation and straining when pooing. Keep the poo soft, and don't strain on the toilet. You can do this by:
Eating plenty of fibre (for example, fruit and vegetables, cereals, and wholegrain bread).

These measures will often ease symptoms of piles such as bleeding and discomfort. It may be all that you need to treat small and non-prolapsing piles (grade 1). Small grade 1 piles often settle down over time.

Frequently asked questions
How long do piles last?
Piles can last for a few days to several weeks or months depending on what grade they are. Most piles clear up on their own within days, however, larger piles can take longer to heal and may require medical treatment.
Are piles dangerous?
Piles are rarely dangerous, but complications can occur. In some cases, the blood supply may be cut off (strangulation) or a clot can form (thrombosis), causing pain. Other complications include skin tags, irritation, infection, discharge, or narrowing of the bottom (stenosis).
Can you push piles back in?
Small grade 3 can sometimes be gently pushed back in, but larger or painful grade 4 piles should not be forced back in and should be treated by a doctor.
Can piles burst?
Piles can sometimes burst and bleed. Although this can be alarming, it usually settles on its own. You should see a doctor if bleeding is heavy or ongoing.
