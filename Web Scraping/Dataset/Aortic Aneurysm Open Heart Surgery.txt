Hi everyone,
I am 41 and due to have my descending aorta fixed due to an aneurysm. They also found my aorta has created vascular ring around my trachea and oesophagus which needs to be sorted out.
They plan to do a thorocotomy. Has anyone had experience of this? I can only find those who have had theirs repaired through the sternum.
The vascular ring is rare and I would love to find anyone who had this and had it successfully fixed.
Thank you x
