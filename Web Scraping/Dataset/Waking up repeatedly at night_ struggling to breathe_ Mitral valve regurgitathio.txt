Hello, I've just turned 40. Very recently, after echocardiogram, was diagnosed with mild mitral regurgitation. This followed gradual worsening of symptoms after hospital admission for severe skin and joint inflammation and breathing difficulties in Jan '20. I consider myself quite physically fit, running regularly. Since hospital admission, I have experienced elevated heart rate when exercising (over 200bpm during 'easy' running), huge fatigue, palpations, rash and, most disturbing, frequent nocturnal dyspnea. Echo has revealed mitral leakage. GP advises I carry on as normal and that it's congenital. I disagree with this hypothesis and feel it's linked to inflammation and infection I had in 2020. Never been diagnosed with murmur and previous echocardiogram in 2011 after pneumothorax didn't flag any issue. I guess my question is: Do I just go about my normal life and exercise routine and follow GP advice of "business as usual"? Or, should I ask for cardiologist referral due to symptoms I've described above actually getting more severe? Especially the high heart rate at quite easy and low intensity exercise, plus the fact that I'm woken up every night, several times, really struggling to breathe. Your advice would be really appreciated. I'm not someone to panic and fear the worst, preferring just to go with whatever's thrown my way. I just have a nagging doubt that this diagnosis could be progressive, has been caused by inflammation and that there's more to it than the "just get on with it" message my GP has given me.

hi, i would ask to be referred to a cardiologist if you haven’t already I’m 32 and my issues started in pregnancy when i was 30 i had issues with high heart rate, blood pressure and dizziness i was already high risk in pregnancy as i have APS which affects blood clotting however my specialist referred me to cardiology and the done a echo and confirmed mild mitral valve regurgitation i was told after pregnancy i would be monitored but to continue as normal, then in 2021 i started getting extremely out of breathe walking upstairs felt constantly tired i put it down to being postpartum the only thing that kept bothering me was i would wake in the night my heartrate would drop down very low (in its 40s) but i did mention it when the cardiologist did a review on me and again i was given a echo it turns out i now have reduced faction of the left ventricle its 42% and my symptoms can from that, so definitely get it checked.
