Hoping anyone has any information that I can research and suggest to my doctor. My blood pressure has been controlled until recently (4 weeks ago). I am currently on Metropolol 50 mg and Valsartan 80 mg. My daily reading after meds has averaged around 150/85. I'd like to get it back down to normal levels. Thanks.
