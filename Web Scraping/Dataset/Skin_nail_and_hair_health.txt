Eczema is sometimes called dermatitis which means inflammation of the skin. There are different types of eczema, but most are chronic conditions. The most common type is atopic eczema.
In this type of eczema there is a typical pattern of skin inflammation which causes the symptoms. Moisturisers (emollients) and steroid creams or ointments are the common treatments. About 2 in 3 children with atopic eczema grow out of it by their mid-teens.

What is atopic eczema?
Atopic eczema is an inflammation of the skin, which tends to flare up from time to time. It usually starts in early childhood. The severity can range from mild to severe. There is no cure but treatment can usually control or ease symptoms.
The word atopic describes people with certain allergic tendencies. However, atopic eczema is not just a simple allergic condition. People with eczema have an increased chance of developing other atopic conditions, such as asthma and hay fever.
Are atopic dermatitis and eczema the same thing?
Generally, yes. When people say 'eczema' on its own, they usually mean 'atopic dermatitis', and vice versa.
'Eczema' can also mean chronic inflammation of the skin generally, so sometimes the term eczema is used alongside another word to describe a different condition. For example, there is discoid eczema, and venous eczema, and the condition seborrhoeic dermatitis is sometimes called 'seborrhoeic eczema'.

Skin, nail and hair health
As we battle through the final stretches of winter, many of us are eyeing our coats and scarves with disdain and fantasising about sunnier days to come. This applies doubly so to eczema sufferers, many of whom find their symptoms peak in winter and recede with the onset of spring.

Skin, nail and hair health
Eczema (dermatitis) is a term used to describe conditions where there is inflammation of skin. There are several types of eczema. Discoid eczema is one type which causes round or oval red patches of inflamed skin. The cause is uncertain. Treatment includes regular use of emollients to moisturise your skin, steroid creams to reduce inflammation and treatment of any infection of the affected skin.

Atopic eczema symptoms
Symptoms of atopic eczema include:
Dry skin.
Dry skin.
Red and inflamed skin. (The most commonly affected areas are next to skin creases, such as the front of the elbows and wrists, backs of knees, face and scalp and around the neck. However, any areas of skin may be affected. The face is commonly affected in babies with atopic eczema.)

Typically, inflamed areas of dry skin tend to flare up from time to time and then tend to settle down. However, sometimes inflamed areas of itchy skin do become infected.
How long does a flare-up last?
The severity and duration of eczema flare-ups varies from person to person and from time to time in the same person.
In mild cases, a flare-up may cause just one or two small, mild patches of inflammation. Often these are behind the knees, or in front of elbows or wrists. Eczema flare-ups may occur only now and then.

In severe cases, the flare-ups can last several weeks or more and cover many areas of skin. This can cause great distress.

Who gets atopic eczema?
Most cases first develop in young children under the age of five years. Current figures suggest about 1 in 3 children have some degree of atopic eczema. However, statistics show that it is becoming more common year on year.
By the mid-teenage years the flare-ups of eczema have either gone completely, or are much less of a problem for 2 out of 3 young people. However, there is no way of predicting who will still be affected as adults.
It is unusual to develop atopic eczema for the first time after the age of 20. About one in ten adults have eczema.
See the separate article called What causes sudden eczema in adults for more details.
What causes atopic eczema?
What is the main cause of eczema?
There is no proven single cause for atopic eczema but factors which may play a part include:
Changes in climate.

The cause is not fully understood. The oily (lipid) skin barrier tends to be reduced in people with atopic eczema. This leads to an increase in water loss and a tendency towards dry, itchy skin. Also, some cells of the immune system release chemicals under the skin surface, which can cause some inflammation.
Genetic factors
Inherited (genetic) factors play a part. Atopic eczema occurs in about 8 in 10 children where both parents have the condition and in about 6 in 10 children where one parent has the condition.
For many people, the exact genetic cause is not clear. In severe eczema, though, about half of all people have mutations in the filaggrin gene, which is important for maintaining the defensive barrier of the skin.
House dust mite allergies
Many people with atopic eczema are allergic to house dust mite.
If you have moderate or severe atopic eczema which is difficult to control with the usual treatments, you may wish to consider reducing the number of house dust mites in your home. See the separate leaflet called House Dust Mite and Pet Allergy, which gives more details on how to reduce house dust mites.
Multiple eczema triggers
There may be a combination of factors in someone who is genetically prone to eczema, which causes the drying effect of the skin and the immune system to react and cause inflammation in the skin.
Other atopic eczema triggers
Other possible factors which may trigger symptoms, or make symptoms worse, include:
Stress and habit scratching.

Pollens, moulds, and dander from pets.

Atopic eczema treatment
When do I need to see a doctor about eczema?
The usual treatment consists of three parts:
Avoiding irritants to the skin and other causes (triggers) wherever possible.

Avoid triggers and irritants
Many people with atopic eczema have flare-ups from time to time for no apparent reason. However, some eczema flare-ups may be triggered or made worse by irritants to the skin, or by other factors. It is commonly advised to:
Avoid soaps, bubble baths, etc, when you wash. They can dry out the skin and make it more prone to irritation. Instead, use a soap substitute plus a bath/shower moisturiser.

Try as much as possible not to scratch. To help with this, keep nails short and use anti-scratch mittens in babies. If you need to relieve an itch, rub with fingers rather than scratch with nails.

Wear cotton clothes next to skin rather than irritating fabrics such as wool. However, it is probably the smoothness of the material rather than the type of the material which helps. Some smooth man-made fabrics are probably just as good as cotton.

After you wash clothes with detergent, rinse them well. Some biological detergents are said by some people to be irritating. But there is little proof that commonly used detergents that are used in the normal way make atopic eczema worse.

See the separate article called How to wash your hands if you have eczema or dry skin.
Avoid food allergies
About 1 in 2 children with atopic eczema have a food allergy which can make symptoms worse. In general, it is young children with severe eczema who may have a food sensitivity as a trigger factor. The most common food allergies which trigger symptoms in some people include cow's milk, eggs, soya, wheat, fish and nuts.
If you suspect a food is making your child's symptoms worse then see a doctor. You may be asked to keep a diary over 4-6 weeks. The diary aims to record any symptoms and all foods and drink taken. It may help to identify one or more suspect foods.
If food allergies are suspected, it should be confirmed by a specialist. They may recommend a diet without this food if the eczema is severe and difficult to control by other means.
Use moisturisers (emollients)
Emollients are lotions, creams, ointments and bath/shower additives which prevent the skin from becoming dry.
They oil the skin, keep it supple and moist and help to protect the skin from irritants. This helps to prevent itch and helps to prevent or to reduce the number of eczema flare-ups.
Warning: some types of moisturiser contain paraffin or other oils, which are flammable. Oils from moisturisers can sink into clothes and bedding and create a fire risk.
Be careful around naked flames (including cigarettes) when using emollients. Avoid smoking in bed.
The regular use of moisturisers is the most important part of the day-to-day treatment for atopic eczema. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist can advise on the various types and brands available and the ones which may suit you best.
Some points about emollients include:
Thicker, greasy ointments work better and for longer than thinner creams but they are messier to use.

Apply liberally to all areas of skin. You cannot overdose or overuse emollients. They are not active medicines and do not get absorbed through the skin.

Various emollient preparations come as bath additives and shower gels. These may be considered in people with extensive areas of dry skin. However, there is some debate as to how well these work. If you do use them, they should be used in addition to, not instead of, creams, ointments or lotions that you rub on to the skin.

Pump dispensers are better than pots because they are less likely to harbour germs. If you need to use a pot, use a clean spoon or spatula to get the contents out, rather than your fingers.

Many people with atopic eczema use a range of different moisturisers. For example, a typical routine for a person with moderately severe atopic eczema might be:
Consider adding an emollient oil to bath water or as you shower. This will give your skin a general background oiling.

A dry dressing may be helpful if your eczema is more severe, as this helps to keep the emollient from being rubbed off the skin and stops scratching. However, you should not use a dressing if a skin infection is present.

Note: emollients used for eczema tend to be bland and non-perfumed. Occasionally, some people become allergic (sensitised) to an ingredient in an emollient. This can make the skin worse rather than better.
If you suspect this, see your doctor for advice. There are many different types of emollients with various ingredients. A switch to a different type will usually sort out this uncommon problem.
Warning: bath additive emollients will coat the bath and make it greasy and slippery. It is best to use a mat and/or grab rails to reduce the risk of slipping. Warn anybody else who may use the bath that it will be slippery.
See the separate leaflet called Moisturisers for Eczema (Emollients) for more details.
Steroid creams and ointments (topical steroids)
Topical steroids work by reducing inflammation in the skin. They are grouped into four categories depending on their strength - mild, moderately potent, potent and very potent. There are various brands and types in each category.
For example, hydrocortisone cream 1% is a commonly used steroid cream and is classed as a mild topical steroid. The greater the strength (potency), the more effect it has on reducing inflammation but the greater the risk of side-effects with continued use.
Creams are usually best to treat moist or weeping areas of skin. Ointments are usually best to treat areas of skin which are dry or thickened. Lotions may be useful to treat hairy areas such as the scalp.
As a rule, a course of topical steroid is used when one or more patches of eczema flare up. You should use topical steroids until the flare-up has completely gone and then stop them. In many cases, a course of treatment for 7-14 days is enough to clear a flare-up of eczema.
In some cases, a longer course is needed. Many people with atopic eczema require a course of topical steroids every now and then to clear a flare-up. The frequency of eczema flare-ups and the number of times a course of topical steroids is needed can vary greatly from person to person.
It is common practice to use the lowest-strength topical steroid which clears the flare-up. If there is no improvement after 3-7 days, a stronger topical steroid is usually then prescribed. For severe eczema flare-ups a stronger topical steroid may be prescribed from the outset.
Sometimes two or more preparations of different strengths are used at the same time. For example, a mild steroid for the face and a stronger steroid for patches of eczema on the thicker skin of the arms or legs.
High-strength steroids
Short bursts of high-strength steroid as an alternative
For adults, a short course, usually three days, of a strong topical steroid may be an option to treat a mild-to-moderate flare-up of eczema. A strong topical steroid often works quicker than a mild one.
(This is in contrast to the traditional method of using the lowest strength wherever possible. However, studies have shown that using a high strength for a short period can be more convenient and is thought to be safe.)
Side-effects of topical steroids
Short courses of topical steroids (fewer than four weeks) are usually safe and normally cause no problems. Problems may develop if topical steroids are used for long periods, or if short courses of strong topical steroids are repeated often. The concern is mainly if strong topical steroids are used in the long term. Side-effects from mild topical steroids are uncommon.
Thinning of the skin has always been considered a common problem. However, recent research suggests that this mainly occurs when high-strength steroids are used under airtight dressings. In normal regular use skin thinning is unlikely and, if it does occur, it often reverses when the topical steroid is stopped.

With long-term use of topical steroid the skin may develop permanent stretch marks (striae), bruising, discolouration, or thin spidery blood vessels (telangiectasias).

Some topical steroid gets through the skin and into the bloodstream. The amount is usually small and normally causes no problems unless strong topical steroids are used regularly on large areas of the skin. The main concern is with young children who need frequent courses of strong topical steroids. The steroid can have an effect on growth. Therefore, children who need repeated courses of strong topical steroids should have their growth monitored.

Recently, there has been more awareness in the media about topical steroid withdrawal (TSW). TSW is still being studied and is poorly defined. Some people find that their skin gets worse after stopping topical steroids, or that their skin seems 'addicted' to topical steroids. There are a few possible reasons:
Some people have severe eczema which rebounds when topical steroids are reduced or stopped. If so, the problem is the eczema, not the steroids - and further, stronger, eczema treatments may be needed.
Occasionally people can develop an allergic reaction to ingredients in a particular steroid cream - meaning they have to use more and more of the steroids, as if they were 'addicted'. If this is suspected, allergy tests can look for the allergy, and different brands of steroids can be used.
Some people have reported red, painful, flaking and peeling skin that appears shortly after stopping topical steroids. This is probably 'true' TSW. It's not clear how often this happens but is probably rare. When it has happened, it's usually occurred after using strong topical steroids on thin areas of skin (eg, the face) for a long time (over a year). TSW is probably much less likely if you avoid using topical steroids for long uninterrupted courses, and avoid using strong steroids on delicate areas of skin.

For more details about side-effects see the separate leaflet called Topical Steroids for Eczema.
Short-duration treatment to prevent flare-ups (weekend therapy)
Some people have frequent flare-ups of eczema. For example, a flare-up may subside well with topical steroid therapy. But then, within a few weeks, a flare-up returns. In this situation, one option that might help is to apply steroid cream on the usual sites of flare-ups for two days every week.
This is often called weekend therapy. This aims to prevent a eczema flare-up from occurring. In the long run, it can mean that the total amount of topical steroid used is less than if each flare-up were treated as and when it occurred. You may wish to discuss this option with your doctor.
Note: don't forget you can use emollients as well when you are using a course of topical steroids. See the separate leaflet called Fingertip Units for Topical Steroids for more details.
Using moisturisers and topical steroids together
Most people with eczema will be prescribed emollients to use every day and a topical steroid to use when flare-ups develop. When using the two treatments, apply the emollient first. Wait 10-15 minutes after applying an emollient before applying a topical steroid.
That is, the emollient should be allowed to sink in (be absorbed) before a topical steroid is applied. The skin should be moist or slightly tacky but not slippery, when applying the steroid.
Infected eczema patches
Sometimes, one or more patches of eczema become infected during a flare-up. Characteristics of infected eczema include:
Weeping blisters.

If the skin infection becomes more severe, you may also develop a high temperature (fever) and generally feel unwell. If infected eczema develops and you are unwell in yourself or feverish, then a course of an antibiotic tablet or liquid medicine will usually clear the infection.
This is used in addition to usual eczema topical treatments.
The UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) updated its guidance on treating infected eczema in 2021. It noted that:
Weeping blisters and crusted eczema do not always mean that eczema has become infected.

Giving antibiotics, especially repeated courses, increases the risk of developing resistant bacteria (meaning that future courses of antibiotics might not work when needed).
They therefore recommend that antibiotics should be only be given if someone with an eczema flare-up is also generally unwell (eg, they have a fever). For people with an infected eczema flare who are otherwise well, they recommend avoiding antibiotics and instead using the usual eczema treatment. In some cases, doctors might recommend antibiotics anyway, if someone is at high risk of a serious complication from infected eczema.
Skin swabs usually aren't helpful in most eczema flares. They can't tell between bacteria that are causing infection, and bacteria that are simply sitting on the skin (which is normal).
There is a rare condition where eczema becomes infected with a virus called herpes simplex. This requires antiviral medication rather than antibiotics. See the separate leaflet called Eczema Herpeticum for more details.
Once the infection is cleared, it is best to throw away all your usual creams, ointments and lotions and obtain fresh new supplies. This is to reduce the risk of applying creams, etc, that may have become contaminated with germs (bacteria).
Also, if you seem to have repeated bouts of infected eczema, you may be advised to use a topical antiseptic such as chlorhexidine on a regular basis. This is in addition to your usual treatments. The aim is to keep the number of bacteria on your skin to a minimum.
What if the eczema treatment doesn't work?
Is eczema forever?
See your doctor if a flare-up of atopic eczema is getting worse or not clearing despite the usual treatments with moisturisers (emollients) and topical steroids. Things which may be considered include:

You may be referred to a skin specialist if a flare-up does not improve with the usual treatments.
Other treatments for atopic eczema
Tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream
They work by suppressing some cells involved in causing inflammation. (They are called topical immunomodulators.) Tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream are not steroids.
They seem to work well to reduce the skin inflammation of atopic eczema. They are licensed for use in people aged 2 years and over who have atopic eczema which is not controlled very well with usual treatments. They should not be used on infected skin.
Steroid tablets
In some cases, steroid tablets are prescribed for a short time if the eczema becomes severe and topical treatments are not helping much.
Eczema soaks
Eczema with blisters may need special soaks to dry up the weepy blisters.
Hospital treatment
This is sometimes needed for severe cases. Treatments which are sometimes used include wet wraps, tar and/or steroid occlusion bandages, light therapy and immunosuppressive/immune-modifying medication.
Tar shampoos
These types of shampoo are useful to lift scale from affected scalps.
Antihistamine tablets
Antihistamine tablets do not have a great effect on reducing itch but some types of antihistamines can make you drowsy. A dose at bedtime may help young children who are troubled with itch to get to sleep.
Dilute bleach baths
Bathing with diluted bleach has been used to good effect in some children with long-term difficult-to-control eczema. The logic is that it helps to clear the skin of germs (bacteria).
Note: this should only be done under the direct supervision and advice of a doctor. Bleach can seriously harm and using the wrong dilution can be very damaging. Do not try this on your own without individual professional advice.
Alternative remedies for atopic eczema
Alternative remedies for eczema, such as herbal medicines, are sometimes tried by some people. However, you should be cautious about using them, especially if their labels are not in your usual language and you are not sure what they contain. Some herbal treatments are mixed with steroids and some (particularly Chinese remedies) have been linked to liver damage.
How to prevent atopic eczema in newborns
It may be worth breastfeeding a newborn baby for three months or more if several members of the family suffer from allergies such as eczema, hay fever or asthma. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that the mother should avoid any particular foods during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
Complications of atopic eczema
Eczema can lead to other problems, such as:
Infected eczema, as discussed above.

Mental health difficulties. Eczema can cause a lot of distress to people, and affect their daily lives. In both adults and children, mental health can suffer as a result of eczema symptoms, potentially leading to poor self-image, poor self-confidence, and depression. In children, eczema can lead to problems such as missing school, and being teased or bullied.

Allergy. People with eczema are more likely to get hay fever and asthma - two other atopic conditions. Eczema in infants seems to be linked with a higher risk of developing allergy, particularly food allergy, later on. One theory is that food particles get onto the skin, and can sink into the leaky skin of children with eczema, where the immune system learns to recognise them as allergens.

Changes in skin colour. After a patch of inflamed eczema has healed, the skin can look lighter or darker than the surrounding areas. This is called post-inflammatory hypopigmentation (if the skin is lighter) or hyperpigmentation (if it's darker). It's more common in people with black or brown skin. It can take several months to heal.

Allergy. People with eczema are more likely to get hay fever and asthma - two other atopic conditions. Eczema in infants seems to be linked with a higher risk of developing allergy, particularly food allergy, later on. One theory is that food particles get onto the skin, and can sink into the leaky skin of children with eczema, where the immune system learns to recognise them as allergens.

What is folliculitis?
Folliculitis means inflammation of the hair follicles. Folliculitis can be a mild, short-lived condition or a severe long-term problem. Folliculitis can occur anywhere on hair-bearing skin. There are a number of causes of inflammation which can result in folliculitis.

Types of folliculitis
Bacterial folliculitis
This is the commonest type of folliculitis and usually arises from the typical bacteria which normally live on the skin causing an infection in the hair follicles. It is very common and easily treated with antibiotics if it is significant enough to need treatment. Often it will settle on its own without treatment.
There are a few specific types of folliculitis:
Sycosis barbae
This is the medical name for a long-term (chronic) folliculitis in the beard area of the face. The skin is painful and crusted, with burning and itching on shaving. Numerous pustules develop in the hair follicles. It can be difficult to treat and some men grow a beard to solve the problem.
Hot tub folliculitis
As the name suggests, this tends to affect people after using a hot tub. The hot water encourages a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa to grow (particularly if there is not enough chlorine in the water to keep it clean). This type of folliculitis is generally harmless and is prevented by proper maintenance of hot tubs. Showering after using the hot tub does not seem to reduce the chance of folliculitis. Antibiotics are not needed for hot tub folliculitis; it usually settles within 2 weeks.
Gram-negative folliculitis
This is a type of folliculitis that may occur after acne has been treated with long-term antibiotics. Gram-negative refers to a type of stain that is used in a laboratory to identify different types of bacteria.
Pseudo-folliculitis
Also known as "razor bumps", this is caused by inflammation from shaving and ingrowing hairs. Pseudo-folliculitis is more common in people with curly or Afro-Caribbean hair, as these hairs are more likely to curl back and grow into the skin. Ingrowing hairs can also be caused by dead skin cells blocking the hair follicle so the hair cannot exit the follicle.
Malassezia folliculitis
Also known as pityrosporum folliculitis, this is caused by yeasts which normally live on the skin but occasionally cause inflammation. Malassezia folliculitis is more common in adolescent boys and young men and is also more common in hot humid climates. Other things that make malassezia folliculitis more common are frequent use of sunscreen, excessive sweating, antibiotic use and the immune system being impaired.

Eosinophilic folliculitis
This rare form of folliculitis is also known as eosinophilic pustular folliculitis or Ofuji disease. It causes itchy pustules and is more common in men than women. The pustules are usually seen on the head, neck and trunk and can persist for weeks or months. It may look like acne. It is associated with HIV but also occurs in people without HIV. Simple anti-inflammatory drugs have been reported to help in up to 7 out of 10 people with eosinophilic folliculitis. Antibiotics may also help.
Carbuncles
A carbuncle is a group of inflamed follicles close together which then join together into one hot red lump with pus coming out of several points. This can be very painful and antibiotics are often needed. Warm compresses may help avoid the need for antibiotics.
Furuncles (boils)
This is an infection deeper in the hair follicle which causes a small abscess just under the skin. It is hot and red. Antibiotics may be needed but warm compresses can often help.

Skin, nail and hair health
Male pattern baldness is the common type of hair loss that develops in most men at some stage. The medical term for this is androgenetic alopecia. It usually takes 15-25 years to go bald, but can be quicker. Typically, at first the hair begins to thin (recede) at the sides (temples). At the same time, the hair usually becomes thin on the top of the head. A bald patch gradually develops in the middle of the scalp. The receding sides and the bald patch on the top (the crown) gradually enlarge and join together, leaving a patch at the front. The patch at the front eventually thins as well. A rim of hair is often left around the back and sides of the scalp. In some men, this rim of hair also thins and goes, leaving a completely bald scalp.
by Dr Toni Hazell, MRCGP
Causes of folliculitis
Folliculitis occurs at sites where hair follicles are inflamed. There are a number of causes:
Infection. Most folliculitis infections are caused by a bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which usually lives harmlessly on the skin. Occasionally other bacteria, fungi (Pityrosporum or Candida albicans) or parasites are the cause.

Medical advice should be sought if there is an infection which is spreading deeper or onto surrounding skin.
Diagnosing folliculitis
There are no specific tests for folliculitis. Normally the diagnosis is obvious from the type of rash.
Occasionally a swab might help if there is discharge from the pustules.
Folliculitis treatment
Identifying the cause of the folliculitis will help decide what will help. General measures include:
Avoiding things that aggravate the condition.

Mild cases
Most cases of folliculitis are mild and do not need any treatment. It often clears without any treatment within 7-10 days.
It may be helpful to use:
A moisturiser (emollient) which contains an antibacterial agent - for example, Dermol® cream.
A moisturiser (emollient) which contains an antibacterial agent - for example, Dermol® cream.
Lotion or Emulsiderm®.
Lotion or Emulsiderm®.
These may help the folliculitis to clear more quickly and reduce the risk of it becoming worse. You can use one of these emollients as a soap substitute until the folliculitis has cleared (and long-term if needed). These can also be added to the bath or shower - specific bath or shower products are not needed.
If simple measures over a few days do not result in improvement of the folliculitis, medical advice should be sought for further advice and treatment.
Localised folliculitis
For localised areas of folliculitis, an antibiotic cream may be useful. Fusidic acid is a suitable antibiotic cream that can be applied 3-4 times per day to affected areas. If the folliculitis is thought to be fungal, a different treatment may be used.
More severe cases
If the folliculitis is more severe or widespread then a course of oral antibiotic tablets may be needed.
Recurrent or long-term (chronic) folliculitis
Recurrent folliculitis occurs when the infection keeps coming back, although it disappears with treatment. The gaps between episodes may get shorter and, eventually, chronic folliculitis is the result.
In these cases, a clinician may take a sample (swab) from the skin where the folliculitis is. This swab can show if an infection is responsible and identify which type of infection it is. The correct medication can then be used to try and eradicate the bacteria from the skin.
Preventing folliculitis
To try and prevent folliculitis, the following actions may help:
Keeping skin clean, dry and free from abrasions or irritations.

Is folliculitis contagious?
Folliculitis itself is not contagious. In hot-tub folliculitis, other people who have been exposed to the same hot tub are likely to develop folliculitis as well.

Acne treatments
Acne (also called 'zits', spots or pimples) is a common condition, particularly in teenagers. It can also occasionally affect middle-aged people and babies.
It often causes a lot of worry and distress but can usually be cleared up, or at least improved a lot, with the right treatment. The treatment can take about a month to work and may need to continue for a while, even after the spots have cleared.

What is acne?
Acne is a common skin condition that causes black, white or red spots, usually on the face. It can also affect other areas of skin such as the back and the top of the chest.
Sebaceous glands are tiny glands found near the surface of skin. The glands are attached to hair follicles in skin. Sebaceous glands stop skin and hair from drying out by producing an oily substance called sebum.
In acne, the glands produce too much sebum, which can form a plug in the follicle (causing blackheads and whiteheads). The normal and otherwise harmless skin bacteria can then infect the plugged follicles, causing papules, pustules, nodules or cysts.
How common is acne?
Most people with acne are aged between 12 and 25 years but some older people are affected. Boys are more commonly affected than girls. Acne usually affects the face but may also affect the back, neck and chest.
About 8 in 10 teenagers develop some form of acne. Often it is mild depending on the type of acne. However, it is estimated that about 3 in 10 teenagers have severe acne bad enough to need treatment to prevent scarring. Untreated acne usually lasts about 4-5 years before settling by itself.
What are the symptoms of acne?
There are six main types of spot that are caused by acne:
Blackheads, which are small and either black or yellowish.

Skin, nail and hair health
How many times have you woken up, looked in the mirror and thought: “What invaded my face overnight?”. In a desperate attempt to erase any signs of the annoying red spots, you immediately reach for the fast-acting acne treatment and start rubbing away, only to be disappointed when that strange-looking pimple or rash is still staring back at you the next day.
by Sara Lindberg
What are the different types of acne?
The common type of acne discussed in this leaflet is sometimes called acne vulgaris. There are other less common types of acne.
Acne (vulgaris) can be divided by severity into:
Mild acne: mostly non-inflamed lesions (whitehead and blackheads).
Mild acne: mostly non-inflamed lesions (whitehead and blackheads).
Moderate acne: more widespread with more papules and pustules.
Moderate acne: more widespread with more papules and pustules.
Severe acne: widespread papules, pustules and nodules or cysts, often with scarring.
Severe acne: widespread papules, pustules and nodules or cysts, often with scarring.
Acne fulminans is a very rare, severe form of acne that almost always affects young, white males. It causes many painful nodules and/or cysts, and affects large areas of the skin. The nodules and cysts fill with blood and often cause severe scarring. Acne fulminans can also cause fever, tiredness, and muscle pain.
What causes acne?
This picture shows a tiny hair follicle and a tiny sweat pore (a 'pore' is just a tiny hole in the skin). The left half of the picture shows a normal hair follicle and pore: they are open, unblocked and working properly.
At the bottom of the shaft of hair a small circle called a 'sebaceous gland' which makes the usual oil that we all have on our skin. The right half of the picture shows what happens if the hair follicle becomes blocked: the oil can't come out on to the skin and so the bottom section of the hair bulges up, full of oil (or what is technically called sebum).
Normal skin and acne skin
This bulge under the skin causes a spot (or 'zit'). Tiny bugs, or bacteria, can then grow inside the blocked hair follicle and make the spot go red and sore.
So the two things that cause acne are:
a) A clogged pore or hair follicle; and/or
b) Infection at the bottom of the blockage.
The treatments for acne aim to:
a) Unblock the pores or hair follicles on skin; and/or
b) Kill any infection inside.
This photo shows blackheads on someone's nose. Blackheads are a blocked pore, with dead skin cells gathered up inside. Despite popular belief, the black bit is not dirt: it's dead skin cells gathered up, made to look dark by the pigment in skin, called melanin.

Can anything else cause acne?
The description above is the cause of almost all cases of acne. Rarely, acne in women can be caused or made worse by certain medical conditions. For example, polycystic ovary syndrome and conditions that cause excess male hormone to be made in the ovary or adrenal gland.
These conditions cause other symptoms in addition to acne, such as thinning of scalp hair, excess hair growth (hirsutism) of facial or body hair, and other problems. Being exposed to chemicals in the workplace, particularly things called halogenated hydrocarbons, can cause acne.
A condition called rosacea, which affects about 1 in 10 people in the UK, can also lead to small cysts and lumpy spots that look like acne. As with acne, rosacea mostly affects the face (although chest, neck and ears can sometimes be affected too). However, rosacea tends to start in middle age and causes other symptoms, such as flushing or redness of the face.
Occasionally acne can be a side effect of treatment with medicines including oral contraception, corticosteroids, anti-epilepsy medicine and lithium.
How to get rid of acne

See also the leaflet on Acne Treatments, for more information on treatments that can be used for acne, such as taking an oral antibiotic.
How to prevent acne
Don't wear make-up every day
Putting on a lot of make-up or foundation can make acne worse. A lot of girls and young women try to cover up their acne with make-up, which is totally understandable.
However, this can further irritate the skin. Some make-up free days let skin breathe. If make-up, one with a pH that is closest to the skin.
Avoid touching your face as much
Touching skin or sitting with hands over cheeks or chin can spread germs from fingers on to face. Try not to touch your face at all, other than for putting on acne medication.
Avoid popping spots
Picking and squeezing the spots may cause further inflammation and scarring.
Keep your skin cool
Sweating heavily or humid conditions may worsen acne. For example, doing regular hot work in kitchens. The extra sweat possibly contributes to blocking pores. Sometimes this is unavoidable, so be sure to splash your face afterwards.
Wear loose clothing
Spots may develop under tight clothes. For example, under headbands, tight bra straps and tight collars. This may be due to increased sweating and friction under tight clothing.
Other information
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advises that there is not enough evidence to support specific diets for treating acne. However, it makes sense to follow a healthy balanced diet low in junk food and refined carbohydrates.
What makes acne worse?
Some medicines can make acne worse. Do not stop a prescribed medicine if you suspect it is making your acne worse but tell your doctor. An alternative may be an option.

What are hives?
Hives (or urticaria) is an itchy rash caused by tiny amounts of fluid that leak from blood vessels just under the skin surface.
A trigger causes cells in the skin to release chemicals such as histamine. The chemicals cause fluid to leak from tiny blood vessels under the skin surface. The fluid pools to form wheals or welts. The chemicals also cause the blood vessels to open wide (dilate) which causes the flare around the wheals. In about half of the cases, the trigger is not clear and cannot be identified.

Hives symptoms
An itchy rash is the main symptom of hives (urticaria). The rash can appear anywhere on the body. Small, raised areas called wheals develop on the skin. The wheals look like mild blisters and are itchy. Each wheal is white or red and is usually surrounded by a small red area of skin which is called a flare.
Hives (Urticaria)
The wheals are commonly 1-2 cm across but can vary in size. There may be just a few but sometimes many develop over various parts of the body. Sometimes wheals that are next to each other join together to form larger ones. The wheals can be any shape but are often round.
As a wheal fades, the surrounding flare remains for a while. This makes the affected area of skin look blotchy and red. The blotches then fade gradually and the skin returns to normal. Each wheal usually lasts less than 24 hours. However, as some fade away, others may appear. It can then seem as if the rash is moving around the body. The rash may clear completely only to return a few hours or days later.
Most people with acute hives do not feel ill; however, the appearance of the rash and the itch can be troublesome.

In some cases a condition called angio-oedema develops at the same time as hives. In this condition some fluid also leaks into deeper tissues under the skin, which causes the tissues to swell. See the separate leaflet called Angio-oedema for more details:
The swelling of angio-oedema can occur anywhere in the body but most commonly affects the eyelids, lips and genitals.
Sometimes the tongue and throat are affected and become swollen. The swelling sometimes becomes bad enough to cause difficulty breathing.
Symptoms of angio-oedema tend to last longer than urticarial wheals. It may take up to three days for the swollen areas to subside and go.

A variation called vasculitic hives occurs in a small number of cases. In this condition the wheals last more than 24 hours, they are often painful, may become dark red and may leave a red mark on the skin when the weal goes. Technically, this type of rash is not urticaria.

What causes hives?
Hives can be triggered by a number of different physical causes. The reason why a rash appears in affected people is not clear. The physical stimulus causes a release of histamine and other chemicals, which causes the rash.
Some known triggers include:
A physical stimulus. Where this is the case the condition is called inducible urticaria. In this type of hives, a rash appears when the skin is physically stimulated (for example, by heat, cold or pressure on the skin).

Allergies - for example:
Food allergies such as allergies to nuts, strawberries, citrus fruit, egg, food additives, spices, chocolate, or shellfish. Sometimes an allergy can develop to a food even if it has been eaten without any problem many times before.
Allergies to insect bites and stings.
Allergies to medicines such as penicillin, aspirin, anti-inflammatory painkillers, etc.

A viral infection such as the common cold or flu can trigger an urticarial rash in some people as a reaction to the virus. A mild viral infection which causes few other symptoms is probably a common trigger of an urticarial rash that develops without an apparent cause.

Types of hives
Hives can be classed as follows:
Acute - if it develops suddenly and lasts less than six weeks. Most cases last 24-48 hours. In some cases the rash only lasts a few hours. About 1 in 6 people will have at least one bout of hives in their lives. It can affect anyone at any age. Some people have recurring bouts of acute hives.

Physical causes can result in repeated episodes of acute hives, or a persisting long-term condition.
The main types of inducible urticaria include the following:
Dermographism
Urticaria dermatographia
By R1carver, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons
Dermographism (also known as dermatographism and dermatographia) means skin writing. People with this condition develop the rash on areas of skin that have been firmly stroked. (Because of this, it is possible to 'write' on someone's skin by applying firm pressure with a finger or other object. The rash follows the line of the writing on the skin.)
The affected area of skin is usually very itchy but in some mild cases it does not itch much. Although any part of the skin can be affected, the palms, soles of the feet, genital skin and scalp are less commonly affected.
Dermographism is more prone to occur when hot. For example, it may develop more easily after a hot shower. The rash tends to last less than an hour. In many cases the pressure needed to be applied to cause the rash is quite firm. However, some people develop dermographism with just light pressure.
Up to 1 in 20 people will develop dermographism at some stage of life. It most commonly first develops in early adult life. In most cases, the condition tends to improve gradually over a few years and it goes or becomes less severe. However, in some cases the condition remains troublesome for many years.
Cholinergic urticaria or cholinergic hives
Cholinergic hives are quite common. The condition is caused by sweating and is sometimes called heat bumps. The hives rash is quite distinct as the wheals are very small (2-3 mm) with a red flare around each one.
The rash appears within a few minutes of sweating and tends to be worst on the chest, back and arms. The rash lasts from 30 minutes to an hour or more before fading away. Some people become slightly wheezy and short of breath for the duration of the rash.
The sweating that triggers the rash may be due to exercise, heat, high temperature (fever), emotion or eating spicy food. It can be problematic when exercising. In severe cases, hundreds of tiny wheals develop when running or doing other types of exercise. Sometimes the tiny wheals join together to form larger ones.
Cholinergic hives most commonly first develop in early adult life. In many cases the condition tends to improve after a few years and it goes or becomes less severe. However, in some cases the condition remains troublesome for many years.
Cold hives or cold urticaria
Cold hives are quite an uncommon condition. An urticarial rash develops after being exposed to cold, including rain, cold winds and cold water. It may be the cold that triggers the rash, or the re-warming of the skin after coming in from the cold.
The rash affects the chilled parts of the skin. If a large area of skin has been chilled, the rash can be very extensive. For example, swimming in cold water may cause a widespread and severe rash over most of the body that can cause dizziness or fainting. (For this reason, people who are known to develop cold hives should never go swimming alone.)
Delayed pressure hives
Delayed pressure hives are uncommon. The condition can develop alone but it commonly affects people who also have chronic hives. In this type of hives the rash develops 4-6 hours after the affected area of skin has had deep prolonged pressure applied, for example, after wearing a tight seatbelt or wearing a tight watch strap. The rash can be painful and tends to last several hours or longer.
Solar hives or solar urticaria
This is a rare condition in which an urticarial rash develops on skin exposed to sunlight.
Water contact (aquagenic) hives
In this rare condition, an urticarial rash develops on skin exposed to water of any temperature.
Vibratory hives
In this rare condition, the rash comes up after using vibrating tools.
Diagnosing hives
Are any tests needed?
Usually no tests are needed. The rash is very typical and is easily recognised as hives by doctors. In a few cases it is clear what caused the rash from the events leading up to it, for example if recently stung by a nettle or starting new medication.
A symptom diary
A symptom diary may be helpful in working out if there is a specific cause. A diary might also show if the rash relates to stress, exercise or sunlight. It may help rule out certain causes.
Skin-prick allergy tests
In some cases, if it appears to be related to an allergy, tests such as skin-prick allergy tests may be helpful. Tiny quantities of substances which might cause an allergy are placed on the skin in a special order. If the skin reacts, there may be an allergy to that substance.
Blood tests
In other cases, blood tests for allergy may be useful. In some people, blood tests may help to point to a cause. These may be general blood tests, or blood tests to look for specific proteins produced by the immune system, called autoantibodies. Where these are found, it is likely that it is the body's own immune system over-reacting and causing the rash. Skin-prick tests are usually ordered in an allergy clinic; blood tests are unreliable and, although they can be ordered by GPs, it is usually best for these to be requested from allergy clinics as well.
Exclusion tests
In some people, 'exclusion' or 'challenge' tests may be needed, for example, testing to see if cold or pressure always causes the rash, or excluding certain foods from the diet to see if that stops the rash from coming back.
Biopsy
Occasionally, if urticarial vasculitis is suspected, a sample of the skin may be taken (a skin biopsy) for further analysis.
Hives treatment
Often no treatment is necessary, as the rash commonly goes within 24-48 hours. A cool bath or shower may ease the itch. Calamine lotion or menthol 1% in aqueous cream can help with itching, although if it is left on for too long the itch may come back. These can be bought without a prescription.
Once it is clear what causes the hives, it may be possible to avoid situations that trigger them. For example, dermographism can often be prevented by avoiding firm pressure against the skin as much as possible. In mild cases, no additional treatment may be needed.
Home remedies
Various other factors may make symptoms worse (but are not the main trigger). The following are tips that some people have found helpful; however, there is little proof that they work in everybody:
Try avoiding tight clothes if wheals occur at sites of local pressure, for example, under belts, under tight-fitting shoes, etc.

Antihistamines for urticaria
Many types of hives are helped by taking antihistamine medicines. (However, these medicines may not help some cases of delayed pressure hives.) Antihistamines block the action of histamine which is involved in causing hives.
The most commonly used antihistamines for hives are:
Cetirizine.
Cetirizine.
Fexofenadine.
Fexofenadine.
Loratadine.
Loratadine.
These do not usually cause drowsiness.
A doctor may advise doses which are higher than the usual recommended dose in order to control the rash. If the itch is making it difficult to sleep, sometimes an antihistamine which causes drowsiness can also be taken at night. Examples of antihistamines used in this way include chlorphenamine or hydroxyzine.
All these antihistamines can be bought over the counter, without a prescription. Whilst a doctor will often recommend taking up to four times the licensed dose (and there is good evidence that this is safe and effective), this should be discussed with a doctor or clinical pharmacist first. Antihistamines are not usually advised in pregnancy.
Some people take antihistamines now and then when a rash flares up. If an antihistamine is taken as soon as the rash appears, the rash tends to fade more quickly than it would do normally. If the rash recurs frequently then a regular dose of an antihistamine may be advised to prevent the rash from occurring.
In cholinergic urticaria where the rash develops on exercise, a dose of an antihistamine just before exercising may help to prevent or limit a flare-up of the rash.
Steroid tablets
Occasionally for severe flare-ups of hives, a course of prednisolone tablets taken for a week may be helpful, but the benefits have to be weighed up against the risks. Unlike most types of hives, those caused by a physical stimulus are not helped by steroids.
Other treatments
Someone with severe episodes of hives may be referred to a specialist. Skin specialists (called dermatologists) or allergy specialists (called immunologists) may be able to help. In particular, if angio-oedema or anaphylaxis occurred at the same time, urgent hospital admission would be required. This is to reverse the reaction quickly and also to confirm the diagnosis and, where possible, to identify a cause. For example, if a nut allergy is suspected to have caused a severe episode then this can confirmed by tests.
Occasionally other treatments may be used, such as a tablet called montelukast, which is usually used for asthma. This may be particularly useful in delayed pressure urticaria, where antihistamines often do not help.
Omalizumab is a newer medication which acts against autoantibodies produced by the body's own immune system. It has to be given by injection once a month. This has been shown to be effective for some types of inducible urticaria in some studies. In the UK the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended its use for chronic spontaneous urticaria where other treatments have not worked. It has to be given by a hospital consultant.
Treatment with ultraviolet light (phototherapy) can cause an improvement in symptoms but, unfortunately, this may only last for a few months.
Are hives dangerous?
Usually not. The rash is itchy but normally fades within a day or so and causes no harm. Most people with hives (acute urticaria) do not feel too unwell unless they have a cold or flu that is triggering the rash. The cause of the rash is not known in more than half of cases and it is commonly a one-off event.
However, hives may be more serious in the following situations:
Food allergy. If a food allergy is the cause then the rash is likely to return each time you eat the particular food. This is more often a nuisance than serious.

Severe allergies. People who have a severe allergic reaction to peanuts, insect stings, etc, often have an urticarial rash as one of the symptoms. This is in addition to other symptoms such as severe angio-oedema, breathing difficulties, collapse, etc. A severe allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis. Note: most people with acute urticaria feel well and do not have anaphylaxis.

How long do hives last?
Inducible urticaria most commonly occurs in healthy young adults. As a rule, hives triggered by physical stimuli tend to improve and become less troublesome with time (often going, or being much less troublesome, after 2-5 years).
Acute hives usually last less than six weeks. Most cases last 24-48 hours and in some cases the rash only lasts a few hours.
Persistent hives tend to come and go. There may be times when the rash appears on most days, and then times when the rash may go away for a while. The severity of the rash and itch varies from person to person. Some things such as heat, cold, menstrual periods, stress, or emotion may make the rash flare up worse than usual.
Symptoms may go away completely after a few months; however, the condition lasts several years in some cases.

Complications of hives
There are usually no serious complications, but the itch can be very annoying and difficult to ignore. If skin is scratched excessively then there is a risk of infection.
Frequently asked questions
Are hives contagious?
Hives are not contagious and cannot be passed from person to person. Whilst other causes of a skin rash are contagious, hives aren't.
What's the difference between hives and a rash?
A rash is a broader term for any change in the skin’s colour or texture. Hives are a type of rash that presents as raised, itchy bumps, that often appear suddenly.
Can stress cause hives?
Stress can trigger or worsen hives as it causes the body to release chemicals such as histamine, which leads to a reaction on the skin.
