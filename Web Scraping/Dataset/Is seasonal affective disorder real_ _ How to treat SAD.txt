Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a common type of depressive disorder that doctors and psychologists treat with various forms of therapy and medicine. It occurs when you develop symptoms of depression, such as sadness, low energy, irritability, and fatigue during particular months of the year.

I’ve been suffering from this for at least 5 years now. I take good quality Vit D regularly and have done for many years. The last three years its become worse by the year. Two years ago it didn’t go away, even in the summer. My doctor arranged counselling for me. I was diagnosed as having CPTSD and currently am undergoing EMDR. Felt things were improving until this week (last week of September) and I feel I’m already going down hill again. So my thoughts are it’s likely SAD as well as CPTSD. My therapist and I have agreed I probably need to go back to my GP to start a new regime of medication again. I feel so disheartened the EMDR hasn’t dealt with the depression (in fairness we are only a third of the way through). I’m nearly 70 btw, female, divorced, I have ME and Fibromyalgia. I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar to myself?
