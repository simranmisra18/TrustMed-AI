I was on sertraline 50mg for a couple of years. Doctor said I could just stop taking them if I wanted to try. However I took my time and took half a dose for a week and then half a dose every other day for a week and now I’ve had a week off them completely. The withdrawal symptoms are terrible. After being off them for a week can I go back on sertraline at a low dose? Will it make me worse again?
