Hello you very wonderful and intelligent people that make up this forum, i truly hope you are doing well and keeping as positive as possible.
I unfortunately for the last year have noticed i have started getting more tired earlier around 9pm. It is frustrating as i used to be able to keep going until 10pm and i usually have a few chores to do at home.
I have tried jogging on the spot and tried turning my lights up at 9pm but sadly the fatigue is so overwhelming that when i stop the exercise, my fatigue comes back again.
I please wondered what i could try to help me push my bed time back, until around 10pm please and try and work through this fatigue i am experiencing at 9pm?
If anyone could kindly help with this i would be forever grateful and thankful, it would mean the world to me and my heart would go out to you.
Thank you very much for your time to read my post and i truly hope you have a wonderful rest of the week. Sending you lots of good wishes and i truly hope you have a wonderful and happy life. With my every best wishes.

You should have some blood work done to check your Iron Levels you could be anaemic or even borderline and this will cause fatigue sometimes quite intense fatigue. Worth getting this done before anything drastic. The exercises in fact will fatigue you further so avoid just before bed.
