Hello everyone, SandraWhiskey here to get a discussion going about advances in LS. Has anyone heard of platelet rich plasma injections? Athletes use it to rejuvenate their parts and there are a very few docs who will inject your genital area with your own platelets. It has helped in some cases. I have Emuaid with serves as an emollient. Perrin’s cream only took money out of my wallet. Clobetasol (US, dermovate in UK) can halt progression to cancer, there was a huge study that proved that. But clobetasol does not resolve LS or make it feel better. Then, has anyone read Ginny Chandhoa’s book “Beating the Disease?” Excellent book with lots of recommendations. LS is an awful disease, about 30% of those who have it also have thyroid anti-bodies, that is, your body is attacking your thyroid gland. This is a huge clue that somebody ought to really investigate.
