that was what my thighs have looked like since the weekend . There are patches of dry skin on the inner thighs .
Ive rubbed Aloe gel into both after showers since i first noticed it , but there’s been no change
The veins have been that ugly red /purple colour for a long time (no idea why .. varicose possibly ?) but not over such a huge area until last weekend . I’m a bit concerned about the patches of dry skin on the inner thighs being an infection risk from clothing rubbing against it .
