Hello, I have had Rosacea since March. I have been diagnosed in July and had Metronidazole prescribed. 30 days later, no change. They then prescribed me Doxycycline. After an additional 30 days, there has been no change in the combination of both Medications. I use Vanicream facewash and also use Beauty of Joseon Sunscreen daily since taking Doxycycline. Could this be something else other than rosacea or should I try different medications?
