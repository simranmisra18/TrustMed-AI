  - Eeyore_: Thank you! (score: 1)
- earthcasey: LETS GOOOOOOOOO (score: 2)
  - earthcasey: This is so awesome in so many ways. Pretty restrictive on the foods but also, it clearly worked for you and that’s so cool. Dropping 100 pounds is such a dream for me, I hope to feel that change someday soon. Keep on keeping on! (score: 3)
- Cashman_1015: Let me ask you a serious question: do you in any way see your diabetes diagnosis as a blessing in disguise? Because that is how I am trying to look at it. I am eating healthier and exercising more than I have in decades and I can see myself getting into better shape than I have been in 35 years. Do I wish I didn’t have diabetes? Gosh yes! But, is it a great motivator? Yes, indeed!!! (score: 3)
  - Eeyore_: Yes. I have viewed it as a motivator. I try to view everything that happens to me through the lens that, if the bad things didn't happen, then the good things wouldn't have happened either. If I didn't get a diabetes diagnosis, I wouldn't have gotten on Mounjaro. I had tried to get on it for weight loss 2 years ago and no doctors would accept me. So, having a diabetes diagnosis means I can now have access to this amazing pharmaceutical. I have lost this weight, I fit into off-the-rack sizes now, I am getting my fitness back, and food isn't controlling my life with an invisible hand. 

Do I wish I didn't have diabetes? Yes. But I do. So I'm not going to mourn that fact, I'm going to use every gift and blessing I have to make the most out of the situation I'm in. 

I once had a terrible boss. He was so bad, that I decided to quit a job I had aimed for and wanted for years, and achieved. But this guy sucked. I couldn't work with him any more. That motivated me to find another role within the company that was even better than the one I had, and unlocked a doorway to greater career growth. I wish I hadn't experienced the heartburn and headaches of working with that guy, but I learned a lesson about how I want to be treated, and how I want to treat others, and what boundaries mean to me. 

There were months where I used to eat a 24 oz ribeye at least once a week, with two sides, an appetizer, dessert, and 3-4 mixed drinks. Now the thought of eating 6 servings of meat in one meal is offensive to me. I still love the taste of ribeye. But now I get to eat it over 2-3 days instead of an hour. 

Instead of preparing huge plates of a basic dish, I can instead spend that same amount of time making smaller portions of inventive and creative dishes. (score: 1)

Your achievement of 100 lbs lost is seriously impressive and inspiring.   
Keep celebrating this win, and may the next steps be just as steady and positive. (score: 2)

Do not put this off as it can turn very dangerous very quick. I assume that if it was in your ability to correct the BG to a normal level, you already would have done so. Since that seems to have not been the case, you should get help from the doctors. It happens to many diabetics, you will not be the first one they see and they will know exactly what to do.

To add: if possible have someone else drive you, otherwise call an ambulance. (score: 5)

  - diabetes-ModTeam: Your post has been removed because it breaks our rules.

**Rule 6**: Do not give or request medical advice.

Giving medical advice or diagnosing someone is dangerous since we do not know the full medical situation of our members. It can be more dangerous to follow the wrong advice and diagnosis than it might be to do nothing at all and wait for a doctor to be available.

Please refer someone to a doctor instead of speculating on their situation where possible.

- ThatLittleLamb: seconding what the other person said about electrolytes, however if you really can't drink anymore water then it's time to go to the hospital. they'll probably stick some IVs in you so they can hydrate you.

on another note, I notice that milk tends to be more short-term hydrating and water is long-term (which is why it's hard for me to drink). if this happens again you could drink some milk and then sip some water and see what happens. maybe it'll be a little easier to handle. if your throat burns you can put some honey in warm milk. you can also have chamomile or peppermint tea. chamomile is anti-inflammatory and tastes wonderful and peppermint naturally has menthol in it.

that's how I care for myself when I'm sick with a cold, but this sounds like it's more of a case of dehydration from hyperglycemia. I'd really keep an eye on yourself and consider your options. check your ketones, give corrections through insulin pen not pump. (score: 2)

Test it to confirm, then hopefully go to your doctor for some better treatment options than whatever you currently have. (score: 2)

OP, please go to the hospital. As everyone else has said, you're likely in DKA and you cannot ignore it, it's not like a headache that will pass, this shit can literally kill you.

  - Grouchy_Geezer: Right, taking it on a full stomach helps.  For many people, asking your doctor to prescribe the extended release version of the pill also helps. (score: 3)

I’m on day three and it’s been like a roller coaster. (score: 1)
    - the_old_evergreen: Ah sorry, my side affects went away. No more nausea or diarrhea after about 10 days. I can't recall how long it took my blood sugar to regulate but it wasn't long.

  
Strangely enough I didn't notice any symptoms of diabetes until I had regular lab work done for a physical. I still don't get symptoms from having high blood sugar so I have to monitor super close to make sure I don't have a spike because otherwise I really wouldn't know! (score: 1)

- True-Lengthiness7598: I had to stay near a bathroom for a couple of weeks. Then gradually things got better. After a couple of months I hardly thought about it.  It also worked to decrease my appetite and make my hunger spells less intense. Since I needed (need) to lose weight, I viewed the decrease in my eating as a positive.


Make sure you sandwich your pill into your meal. Since you are just taking one pill per day, try it at different meal times. (score: 3)
  - MizBHaven7: That's good to hear your symptoms went away, it gives me hope!

Some people can tolerate Metformin, others like me just can't. You could try the ER version, some people found that worked better for them. (score: 1)
- Tdffan03: Switching to metformin er helped me. (score: 1)
- mayafayadaya: I feel you! Here's what's worked for me: 

Take your pill after / with food. ALWAYS. Eat low carb as much as possible. Carbs activate the metformin for me and totally throw my stomach out. Make sure you're getting enough protein and vegetables (esp fiber). Jenny Ruhl's Blood Sugar 101 book and website have been excellent for this. Superb information, recipes and medication advice.

Try to get on Metformin ER (Extended release) if you can. It helps with the gut trouble. 

Keep a small vial of peppermint essential oil in your purse. Sniff it every time you feel nauseous, it helps. For me, the nausea lasted a full two weeks before it finally calmed down. Even now, if I take a break from my medication, once I get back on it I need two weeks for the nausea and tummy pain to settle down. 

Remember to stay hydrated. I drank lots of herbal teas to get me through those first few weeks. Mint or peppermint help with nausea. 

Try to eat yogurt if it suits you - good bacteria for your tummy.

Hang in there! It gets better! (score: 1)
- LittleUsagi85: I had some tummy issues when I first got on it, found if I ate too many carbs I'd be in the bathroom real fast. I played around and found how many carbs I could eat without tummy issues and it was fine after that. Its been about 2 years now and fine with metformin. (score: 1)

Ozempic is also on the formulary and is probably recommended by the medical app she uses. (score: 3)
- ShaxxsSon: A consistent a1c of 5.6 to 5.8 would translate to an average glucose of 122-129mg/dL (6.8-7.2mmol/l). 


While you *could* go lower, you could also stay comfortably in that range and be fine. I'm not trying to sway you one way or the other, just that, an a1c of 5.6 to 5.8 is a reasonable level for a diabetic, and that you're already doing well.

- cjmnews: Diabetes management is a combination of medication, diet and exercise.

In some cases, people can manage with 2 of the 3, but a lot of people need all three.

Honestly, his doctor should have provided guidance on what changes need to be made to help bring that HbA1C down 3-4 points.  If this doctor is a Primary Care, then he should find an endocrinologist who is better equipped to provide this guidance.

Please keep in mind, carbohydrates raise glucose, no matter where they come from.  Quinoa and fruit are carbohydrates.  Walks after every meal could be beneficial.  Regular medication (per doctor) also helps.

There are no "good for diabetic" foods.  There are foods with lower impact, but even protein can raise glucose.  Also every diabetic has a different reaction to food and medication, so there is no "do this and you'll be fine" advice that can be given. (score: 2)

- External-Building102: Maybe: Let her be in charge. Tell her she has to wear it,  but she's in charge. Get some noise cancelling headphones, like they put on children at concerts. Pick out a treat. Maybe she wants to collect bracelets. Get a new stuffy to hold. "I want to make this easier for you, what would help make it easier for you.". IDK, but maybe there are YouTube videos of kids doing it like champs. I'm sorry you are all having to go through this. (score: 22)
- alianaoxenfree: Total unpopular opinion but we let my nephew say a “bad word” when he got his put on. And when my daughter had to do her blood draws (she has pku) we would let her do the same. It made it sort of silly, honestly. But they both felt a little in control of the situation. (score: 15)
- Randomness-66: When I was a child, I had to wear an eye patch. I had a few of them with different designs, despite how cheaply made they were. 

Maybe ask her what sticker she’d like daily on her sensor or offer her holding her teddy bear or something of comfort that can be in the room with her. 

Baby talk is best, she’s scared and needs a soft voice. Plus she’s hitting the point where her hormones are going crazy as well as being a diabetic. She’s going through a crazy time, whatever your solution is, good luck ❤️ (score: 11)
- Mimolette_: I would try to approach it like it’s no big deal. She’s probably sensing you’re nervous about it, and feeding off that energy. It’s no criticism of you, it’s very understandable to be nervous about it at the start because it’s important to get it on her and it can be tough. But it actually doesn’t hurt much and is quick. I would treat it just like making her put her shoes on or whatever. No dramatic build up, waiting to be ready, etc. Get it all set up and tell her it’s time for the sensor with a big smile on as if you’re doing something fun and just do it quick. Then once it’s on say yay and do a dance or something to distract her from the minor pain. Then she gets to pick a sticker or something else fun, and move on quickly. (score: 7)
- R1R1FyaNeg: My daughter wasn't allowed small screens, but when she was getting her monitor on, I would give her my phone and let her watch YouTube. She'd zone out on that and I get it done.

She eventually got used to it and just watches to make sure we do it correctly. (score: 7)
- Various_Archer6512: This may be completely useless advice depending on your circumstances.
If you can, apply one to yourself and show her, look, it's okay, Mama or Dada can put the thing on, it is loud and scary, but if  mom and dad can handle putting one on, it might help her recognize that it's something good if her closest influences can tolerate it. The application is really more startling than it is painful, even my bf jumped when I was putting on a fresh sensor for the first time around him lol. You might even be able to have them send a replacement if you tell the company it was faulty or didn't connect properly ( I know most companies process claims like that differently so if it's not something you can do that's understandable.)

(score: 3)
  - Tavrock: My doctor had me try Ozempic for weight loss about six months before my daughter was diagnosed with T1D at 9yo. Like you, stabbing myself was incredibly hard for me to do, even with the new itty bitty needles. (I think it's fun to donate blood. Those needles don't bother me. I'm just weird.) It still took me a few times before I could stab myself without taking several moments to do it, even though I knew it didn't hurt.

That experience made it a LIT easier to use an incredibly similar system to dose my daughter with insulin and know that at least the needle wasn't going to hurt her. (score: 2)
- AmazingAd192: Be calmer than calm in yourself. Don't be tense trying to act calm. And don't drag it out over time by thinking that it's kinder to go slowly. It's kind of a rip the band-aid situation where the worry is worse than the actual event. Try to notice when they're a bit distracted and less tense. If the body part is tense, it's a little more painful. (score: 2)
- Working-on-it12: Look into adhesive remover. I have a spray that dissolves the adhesive so it doesn’t hurt removing the sensor. It takes longer to change them, but may help. 

Let her pick out the patches. Mine have VanGogh images on them. 

Can you let her pick where they go? (score: 2)
  - Tavrock: Baby oil (mineral oil), goo gone for bandages, and playing in water have all been effective for us. The adhesive remover specifically made for diabetes supplies never seemed to work as well.

At 9yo, we usually struggled more with keeping them on. I can't imagine trying with a 4yo. (score: 2)
- OrugaMaravillosa: Seeing that other people wear them might help make it less scary. 

Someone else mentioned that there are videos of toddlers putting them on? I wonder if some of those toddler videos would help? Especially if there are any where the toddlers are acting happy or silly. Make a playlist of the best ones so you don’t accidentally get a scary one.

There are also kids books. I have no idea how good these are or what they talk about but some are: 
* My Body Beeps!: Growing Up With Diabetes
* Perfect The Way I Am: Learning to love what makes you unique (shows a monitor on her arm)

Just search for diabetes children’s books and you’ll see more titles.

Searching diabetes doll on Amazon pulls up a doll with a glucose monitor.

Are there any family acquaintances that wear a monitor? (score: 1)
- highpie11: As a T1D parent, my kiddo was so happy when I tried out the Stelo. Maybe buy a pack and show her that her adults wear sensors too! Maybe show her some videos of other T1D doing sensor changes.  I follow quite a few T1D parents on instagram. 

We do lidocaine for site changes but maybe try it for Dexcom.  People also ice or the buzzy bee. 

Hang in there. (score: 1)
- CalmNatural2555: Try to make it fun.  Choose some colorful overpatches (Amazon sells them) and allow her to choose which overpatch she wants to wear each time.  Let her activate the sensor using the app on the phone.  Talk about WHY she needs to wear a CGM and how brave she is.  Distractions can also be a huge help.  Perhaps a new container of bubbles to blow while you change the CGM? Seeing that others wear these too could also help.  There's even a diabetic Barbie doll! Try a relaxed time of day.  Perhaps just after a bath? The most important thing is to remain calm yourself. (score: 1)
- BlankLiterature: Might not be the best advice but if the situation is urgent... depending on how heavily she sleeps, just put it on while she's sleeping. Then you can say "see, we did it last night and you didn't even feel it, it's scary but it really doesn't hurt much". (score: 1)

- cjmnews: Diabetes is not consistent.

Currently, the tests show a lower insulin resistance than before.  That could change, and more management may be needed, especially as we age.   (score: 3)
- clintCamp: I think maybe restricting carbs too much causes higher spikes when you do get them? I have been relaxing my diet lately, but just finger prick once or twice a day and oddly mine is behaving well recently. I just did 6 months of hard core low carbs and have started making my own sourdough bread again which I now add lots of whole grains and extra fiber to and it seems like I can almost eat a good amount of carbs now as long as it has sufficient fiber.  I don't know have a CGM currently so I have no clue what it is doing throughout the day, so who knows if relaxing is better or worse for me yet. (score: 2)
- Apprehensive_Ad_1501: I don't understand why some endo's and dietitians are so pushy towards staying with high carbs 🤷

Maybe it's just easier for them to have all patients follow the same recommendations or not to have to study or dive into unique cases themselves.

Mine were the same. I am still staying with lower carbs as it's both easier to manage and feels better. 

We landed on that I should not go below 1g/kg/day which is fine with me as it's hard to stay lower on a vegetarian diet anyways.

But I definitely wouldn't sacrifice my health risks, especially for a few months, just to prove the point.

Maybe just try to consider how you feel: is it better with low carb, or better when you let it go - both physically and mentally. (score: 2)
  - jitterqueen: I do feel better physically and mentally on lower carbs. I also get really uncomfortable ear pain when my glucose spikes too high, so I am definitely more comfortable being lower carb. However, I do have a history with ED, so being low carb all the time is pretty restrictive. I guess I could find some sort of balance like you did instead of an all or nothing approach which seems the only thing I'm capable of doing. (score: 1)

Bulls**t 

I think there are alot of people who experience temporary diabetes, like hepatogenous or if u had some crazy infection wich made your number go nuts before u test a1c, if u took cortison or something else all of this doctors must add up and put into the diagnosis. But gps are fast to diagnose, only real way to know is if u have a normal FBG and do an OGTT if u clear it by WHO standards i would say u dont have diabetes, let the downvotes come… (score: 1)
  - jitterqueen: I don't understand what you mean. I am a diabetic, and will be for the rest of my life. I have kept my A1C in control with a low carb diet and exercise. I am just shocked how it didn't go up after three months of no restrictions.

Although I haven't gotten a OGTT, I do get a really high spikes when eating carbs/sugar. Like 4 biscuits shot it from 80 to 220 mg/dl that lasts for 2-3 hours before crashing back down. I don't think a healthy non-diabetic person would have a similar response.

I go to an endocrinologist and wasn't on any kinds of medications before my diagnosis either. Unless you call 6 litres of water per day a form of self-medication lol. (score: 1)
    - Top_Cow4091: 6liters? Isnt that dangerous? (score: 1)
      - jitterqueen: I don't know. I was definitely drinking that much for 3-4 weeks before my diagnosis. It took really long for me to think, hmm, maybe this much water consumption isn't normal.

I'm not drinking 6 liters of water on the regular. It was just before I got my diabetes diagnosis. (score: 1)

- throwaway_ga33: My nutritionist stressed the importance of having at least one but up to three carb choices per snack or meal due to your liver releasing glucose if you don’t have enough carbs, thus causing your sugars to be higher (score: 1)

- kimpurple21: I am Native American and your story sounds like mine, I was pre for 20 years though.  It hit me one day with a flu like illness where my son brought me to the E R with sugar of over 600 - you are now diabetic - work on your log, keep your aic and glucose low and try everything - every person is different, keto helps most, vegan helps others you have to find your path, omad helps me that knowledge comes after years of trying different diets, when not on omad the Mediterranean diet worked for me.  Instead of a second opinion, focus on what works for you.  Cheat days are okay but remember to balance it and keep hydrated your meds are flushing sugars into your bladder/liver etc so fluid keeps that system flowing.  Good luck! (score: 6)

- TheRealSlim_KD: You don't mention Metformin?! That's strange. 
You are listerally passing out sugar and that is  possibly reflecting lower BGS numbers.

Remission (or just being in &lt;6 numbers for HbA1C) is going to be difficult to explain while on Farxiga. If you were at 10.4 then you are a diabetic for sure.

I would be wary of dropping off medication in toto. I would suggest you never get off Metformin, but as I say- I am surprised you are not on it at all. (score: 1)

There anplenty of benefits to staying on them as well if you are tolerating them well. Metformin  especially.

It's a decision that you will have to make for yourself as we are all different. (score: 1)
- psoriasaurus_rex: I have tight control (a1c of 5.1), and I have no plan to discontinue my medication (Mounjaro and metformin).  

I don’t have negative side effects. My meds are safe and very effective.  They do more than just glucose control (reduce risk of other diseases diabetics have higher risk of: CVD, CKD, stroke, likely cancer and dementia).

I don’t really understand why I should try to go off of my medication when it’s working so well for me. Diabetes is a chronic disease. I want to use all the tools available (meds, diet, lifestyle) to have the best chance of controlling diabetes and living a hopefully long and healthy life. (score: 1)

- cjmnews: The liver dumping glucose into our systems when we wake up is terrible.

You maybe could have had the English Muffin with a correction dose combined with the bolus. (score: 5)
  - friendless2: I have been waking up at 250, taking a triple bolus to correct, sleep for an hour or 2, then get up and double bolus for breakfast carbs.  Looking at basal being too low... (score: 3)
    - EmbarrassedTea1885: Definitely need to up the basal! I am currently taking 10 in the morning and 5 before bed to manage my sugars when I sleep so they aren’t high but not too low either. (score: 2)
    - EmbarrassedTea1885: I am weaning off of the basal though and trying to wean off of insulin. I walk a lot so I manage the carbs. Since I am a server I don’t always get breaks either so more often than not my sugars are low (not 60 low but around 90’s-100). Then I come home and eat dinner then go for an hour walk to burn the carbs. And I try to eat low carb and I half the English muffin so I am only getting 14 carbs. I started with over 30 units of basal. My eating was out of control and now I am trying my best to manage it without giving everything I like up. I just eat half of my usual serving. Like I want a donut I can have half while I am working (sneak to the locker on a bathroom break quickly lol) and the other half the next day. Keeps me from going crazy (score: 1)
      - cjmnews: If you are type 1, you can't "wean off of insulin".  Lack of insulin is the cause of DKA, which can cause death.

You may be able to manage with less insulin and more exercise, but using none as a Type 1 is not feasible.  The liver puts glucose into our bodies naturally, and that will require insulin to manage. (score: 5)
- drugihparrukava: Foot on floor syndrome. 

I bolus for that if I'm on a different schedule that day, but usually if i get up at the same time then I have a basal rate set just for that. and my i:c ratios are different in the morning as well. It's a struggle setting exact basal rates for dawn phenomenon, then feet on floor syndrome, it's like one thing after another. Pumping has made that portion of the day a bit smoother. (score: 2)
- RightWingVeganUS: Two things I do to start the day:

* Immediately upon waking I set a 10 minute timer. I do a quick check of the news and go to the restroom. When the alarm goes off I do the Radio Taiso workout: a 3 minute light exercise routine
* Then I set a 20 minute timer. Empty the dishwasher, futz around, whatever, then do a 15 minute walk or ride on the indoor bicycle trainer. Am thinking of getting a walking pad for when the snows come. If I have lots of time and energy I'll extend to 30 minutes.
* Then I'll take 10 minutes to relax and check my BP and blood glucose levels.

I'm not a morning person, thus the need for the alarms. Like you I'm committed to managing my HbA1c and am doing what I can to achieve reversal of the condition. (score: 1)

    - EmbarrassedTea1885: Exactly. I was dreaming of having half of an English muffin which has 13 grams because I never eat a whole serving of anything with carbs. I always split things like when I make a sandwich I make it open face. And breakfast is the best time for carbs for me since I walk a lot. I am a server so I burn the carbs off. (score: 2)

Cereal is tricky!

For cereal, whole milk may help, but will add calories from the fat. What really works for me though is that if my BG is above 100, I bolus in advance. Then, I wait until my sensor glucose reading just starts to dip before I start eating.

But, don't forget to eat when it does! Watch it like a hawk or you risk going low.

If I time it right, my sensor glucose bottoms out at about 75 - 80 mg/dL before starting to rise again.

As a vegan, animal products are simply not classified as "food" for me.

That said, I tried the "Too Good To Go" app and got two produce bags.

* From an ethnic grocery I got to play Iron Chef with the secret ingredient "Ash Gourd," which I had never heard of before.

They also threw in a box of milk-chocolatey cookies which I will donate to a food shelf or hostel.

I noticed after my hip replacements, that I was moving much more, taking stairs without calculating how to save trips up and down stairs when there was no pain to deal with, and my BS levels stayed in the 80 to 110 range, instead of the 120 to 140s range when I wasn't moving as much because of the hip and back pain.

I've been type 1 (edit: typo, wanted to say since I was 5, but somehow ended up writing type 5, which is not a thing) since I was a kid and was around a bunch of other type 1 diabetics and nobody put on weight. Some say that you don't quite feel full as easily, but your milleage may vary. Insulin is likely not going to be the root cause of putting on weight.

Note that type 1.5 is not really an official diagnosis, at the end of the day you are still type 1, it's just a slow onset. (score: 3)
  - the_angry_avocado: Hey thanks! I’m just nervous because I’ve lost a lot of weight and don’t want to gain it back (score: 1)
    - HellDuke: Being nervous is probably a bigger risk of being a root cause for gaining weight than insulin if you are a stress eater (e.g. some people tend to eat more when they are stressed or anxious).

The human body is a complex thing and when you are diabetic other factors change, but even when someone does put on weight, insulin itself is not the cause. Think about it this way: the insulin you are taking is not some drug/chemical that causes change in your body, it's what your body already produces and needs, only difference is that ours do not produce it (or not enough of it) so we have to supplement it. Why would something that your body should normally be making suddenly make you gain weight if it didn't before diabetes?

Type 2 is different, because the body does produce insulin, they are just resistant to it. So things like Ozempic are used to make the body produce more. But like I said — complexity of the human body. What else does your body do when forced to produce more insulin? (score: 1)

- Graveyardhag: Insulin can make you gain weight, but ONLY if you also have insulin resistance. I have this particular issue, and I have extreme insulin resistance. 

It can also help a type 1 gain healthy weight when they've been Ill and losing weight before diagnoses. Because their body stops eating all their fat reserves and starts functioning properly with insulin on board. 

Insulin doesn't in and of itself, cause weight gain. 

As a 1.5 you will eventually need insulin no matter what, and it seems the time is now. (score: 1)

And of course companies sell diabetic medical supplies. 

But I don't think I've seen it all under one roof. 

It might be challenging to do that in the US, honestly, because there's a lot of laws about what you can and cannot do with "mixing" formal medical care services and commercial services. At least, if you're billing insurance for anything. 

I would kinda love to see a little "planned cooperation" built around diabetic and related needs, now that you mention it.

* Dieticians who specialize in the different types of diabetes and diabetic options. 
* A gym with coaches and classes specifically trained in diabetes needs 
* A cooking school for home cooks

The business model has to be totally different from India. In India these programs run cheap and rely mostly on coaches. In the US the successful ones (Virta, Omada, Livongo, Signos, Lark Health) work because they plug directly into insurance and employer health plans. The money doesn’t really come from the patient, it comes from insurers reimbursing remote monitoring, telehealth, and diabetes-care codes.

In the US you need actual clinicians, not just coaches, to adjust meds, monitor CGM data, and bill Medicare/insurance. You also need HIPAA compliance, FDA-safe workflows, and state-licensed telehealth. The upside is much higher revenue: US companies can bill around 1500 to 3500 dollars a year per patient, plus recurring monthly reimbursement for remote monitoring. The downside is higher acquisition cost, higher regulation, and more complexity. I hope that answers your quest, or it may be irrelevant.  I just took a chance. (score: 2)

Even at my pre amputation weight though, while I was just under obese on the BMI, I looked pretty good and everyone though if I got down to about 170 I wouldn't need to lose more weight because I'm "built like a brick shithouse" as my grandpa used to say. Long line of farmers, and so we are built like fantasy dwarves. Short, broad shoulders, and small waists. For context, my upper body is a V, I'm a size 44 jacket and that is usually like a 40 in pants, but I'm a 30. (score: 4)

I'm probably going over to Manjaro because my sugar is to high after COVID ruined my pancreas. Maybe even slow working insulin. (score: 3)
- AloneChallenge9878: *Not medical advice.  Just my experience.*  Taking it weekly was hard on me too so I asked care team if I could space the doses further apart.  It gives me extra days to catch up on average calories and still good for glucose control (just a little under the performance of the weekly dose).

- psoriasaurus_rex: If you’ve just started it, this should improve some with time for most folks.  In the meantime, you can try drinking some of your calories (protein shakes, smoothies, etc.).

  - Eeyore_: That's the beauty for me. I know I can't eat much, so I want what I eat to be the most it can be in a single bite. What a delightful constraint and muse this reduced appetite is! Before Mounjaro, I could do a 7 course meal and want two more following it, because even though the food was delightful and delicious and savory and aromatic and above all enchanting...the portions were so small. I could never eat a tasting menu and feel sated afterwards. And I'd head out afterwards, and stop at a burger joint on the way home. 

Now, when I experiment with flavors, I am much more daring and much less risk averse and hesitant. The crutches of the easy answer, "add sugar" or "make it into bread" or "Do both, and make it a cake. Or a pie! Ooh, make it a pie!" are incredible. 

I hope to one day become a gustatory hipster, lamenting the vulgarity of the common palate, while simultaneously bored of the novel fusion restaurants, like old money with the nouveau riche. (score: 2)
  - No_Mountain6950: I'm not on this medication but have been thinking of starting and this was one of my questions based on all the people saying they have no appetite. My other question is about cooking for your family, can you still do this? (score: 1)
    - Eeyore_: I've been on Mounjaro since February 7, 2025. My dosing schedule has been:


Dose | Duration | A1C | BMI | Start Weight | End Weight | lbs lost | Total Lost | Lost/wk
----|--------|---|---|------------|----------|--------|----------|-------
0 | 5 weeks | 10.2 | 40.62 | 325 | 318 | 7 | 7 | 1.3 lb/wk
2.5 | 4 weeks | --- | 39.74 | 318 | 300 | 18 | 25 | 3.0 lb/wk
5.0 | 4 weeks | --- | 37.49 | 300 | 280 | 20 | 45 | 2.8 lb/wk
7.5 | 4 weeks | 6.2 | 34.62 | 280 | 277 | 3 | 48 | 2.8 lb/wk
7.5 | 12 weeks | 5.4 | 32.24 | 277 | 258 | 19 | 67 | 2.28
10 | 15 weeks | --- | 28.87 | 258 | 227 | 31 | 98 | 2.17


I still take pleasure in the sight, smell, and taste of foods. I just don't feel any great desire to eat more than a recommended portion. I had a 6 oz filet mignon a few months back, and that was a lot. I usually eat less than 4 oz of meat in a meal. That is opposed to pre-Mounjaro, when a 24 oz ribeye would go down no problem any night. 

You might imagine that I stop eating because I am somehow disgusted by food. After all, your experience is probably like mine was before Mounjaro. That I could salivate and feel a compulsion to eat delicious smelling foods, regardless of when I last ate. But, that's the part that's gone, the compulsion, not the pleasure, not the joy. The empty hole that could not be filled, but ever hungered. 

I am not disgusted by food, when I am not hungry. But it is like viewing an attractive member of a group I do not find desirable. I can acknowledge it in an intellectual manner without the primitive instinct signals of desire. 

And I don't need to be hungry to cook. And, if anything, not being distracted by those primitive urges to consume allows me to be more thorough in my preparations, and creative in my creations. After all, I don't have to make 20 deviled eggs a week for myself, I can make 2 deviled eggs and try them with truffle slices, or caviar, or lump crab meat, or whatever. And it's incredible. It's possibly more incredible than before, because I don't have the guilt and shame of being a social pariah weighing over me, for being fat. 

I can eat whatever I want. What I want has changed. What I used to want was a 24 oz ribeye, with two sides and an appetizer, and a dessert, and 4-5 glasses of alcohol. Now what I want to eat is "whatever diet keeps my diabetes from driving me to become a blind amputee on dialysis." And every bite is delicious. 

I can tell you, I've had delicious, incredibly creative healthy dishes that I never would have considered when I was in my 24-oz-ribeye-pre-Mounjaro days. I can go to a prix fixe dining experience and not only enjoy the gustatory delights, but I can feel sated from them as well. How awful it was, in the before-times, when I would go to a 7 course tasting meal, and then feel an urgent, gnawing, compulsive need to stop off and grab a burger. A double. With cheese. And bacon. Large fries, obviously! And, yeah, let me get a Dr. Pepper to wash it down.

I cooked for a party I attended November 1st. I'm known as a bit of an over-preparer among my friends. I usually make way too much of one thing. But, this time, I made way too many different things. Each of which were a delight to the partygoers. It was a situation where an individual couldn't eat one of every item I prepared. And everything I prepared was in 1-2 bite sizes. (score: 5)
      - earthcasey: Hey! Sorry to piggyback on an answer to someone else's post here but your comment is so insanely helpful. I just got told 30 minutes ago I have to go on Mounjaro after finding out I have diabetes yesterday. (36M, 314lbs, 7.4 a1c) and it scares me so much because of all of this but you cleared up so many concerns.

One of my bigger fears is losing weight too quickly and having a bunch of loose skin. Did this happen to you? I'm also scared of it messing up my digestive system since I have had awful GERD since I was 15 and crohn's disease. Any insight is huge even if it doesn't fit the exact vacant puzzle piece. THANK YOU!! (score: 2)
        - Eeyore_: While learning you have diabetes and need medication potentially for life may feel like an awful shock to the system today, the change you need to make is how you perceive what you do to manage this condition going forward. 

Do not view your diet as restricted. It is expanded in new directions you wouldn't have pursued before. 

I'm 46 and I started a bit higher than you, but I'm 6'3" so that will have an impact on basal metabolic rate. 

If you have specific fears you'd like to discuss, I'm happy to tell you how I addressed them, or share in existential dread alongside you.

- coffeecatsandtea: I'm on Trulicity and it has the same effect; I only eat because I have to take Metformin with food, so at least there's that? At the beginning of the week when the effects are strongest, I have a protein shake as my morning meal, or a Soylent drink. 

Make sure you're getting enough fiber as well - with the reduced hunger/smaller portions, I wasn't getting enough fiber when I started and it messed with my regularity. GLP-1s will slow the whole digestive system, so it takes longer to process meals even if the portions are smaller. Psyllium husk pills/Metamucil and or a probiotic soda like poppi or olipop will be your friends. (score: 2)

- xx_maknz: Might be time to look into nutrition beverages during this time. The kind that contain several vitamins and minerals so you’re getting what you need in the meantime. I’d suggest ensure or boost, or really any supplement shakes you can tolerate. If you’re not a creamy shake person, ensure makes supplement drinks that are like juice - they’re called ensure clear and they come in a few different flavors, but the mixed fruit and blueberry pomegranate are available on amazon. They make an apple one (my personal fav) which isn’t on there sadly. Boost also apparently makes a clear shake called boost breeze! (score: 1)
  - Eeyore_: Aren't they high in carbohydrates for a diabetic? I get protein drinks, but, the ones I get, if they have any carbs at all, it's 1 gram. But I know I've seen juice drinks with 40+ carbs and sugars per serving. 

I looked up the nutrition information for [Ensure Original Nutrition Shake](https://abbottstore.com/adult-nutrition/ensure/ensure-original/ensure-original-nutritionshake/ensure-original-nutrition-shake-milk-chocolate-8-fl-oz-bottle-case-of-24-57231.html) and it says 33 grams of carbs per 8 oz serving. That's more carbs than I usually eat in an entire day. But, I'm basically doing keto. I know some folks say they keep their per-meal carbs capped around 30-40. I'd just be afraid that, with it being an 8 oz drink, it would absorb faster and drive my glucose up, compared to eating solids. (score: 1)
    - xx_maknz: I mean, the way you described your current blood sugars after consuming carbs, combined with the fact that you said you were too full to eat from 7:30pm one night to 12:30am the next day, i think just getting nutrients is the priority here… But I do understand your concern. I actually meant to add Glucerna to that list, so that’s my bad! Glucerna is much lower in carbs than some of the others i mentioned. Premier protein is also another great option, as they are very low carb, contain a substantial amount of protein, and taste far better in my opinion. (score: 1)

How long have you been experiencing this multi-day feeling full?

If you've been on it long and lost significant weight and are looking to go into maintenance, your doctor may need to decrease your dosage. (score: 1)
  - kaicxre: only about 8 days, and the feeling full thing happened pretty much immediately (score: 1)
    - Eeyore_: If you've only been on Mounjaro, for 8 days, what you're experiencing is better than normal. It means medication is working. But, you'll adjust to each dose over a few weeks. I've been on Mounjaro for 10 months, and I'm on the 10 mg dosage today, have been for 15 weeks, and was on 7.5 for 16 weeks before that. My A1C went from 10.2 at diagnosis to 5.4 in 6 months, so that was all on the 7.5 mg dosage. 

If you're overweight, this is not a bad side effect. This means you're responding very well to the medication. The GLP-1 be GLP-1ing. Many people who are using it, both for diabetes and for weight loss say they don't see any impact until they're on 7.5-10 mg doses. But you can go up in dosage at a slower pace. Typically, for diabetes treatment, you'll need to step up to at least 5.0 mg for insurance purposes, (assuming US based). But on /r/Mounjaro you will find many people who have only been using 2.5 mg for months and in some cases 2 years now. (score: 3)
- kimpulsive2022: With you on this  
Even when my tummy rumbles I go over what food I have and can eat and go "m'eh"

My best advice is to find foods that aren't intolerable - recently I've found that I actually like the egg white/turkey bacon sammy from starbucks on a whole wheat english muffin. 26 carbs is right in my 30 carbs for a meal range  
It sometimes feels weird to go and get one for lunch because "breakfast sandwich" but its not m'eh ever for me

Also eat very small meals because that "still full from last night's dinner" thing is very real and with Mounjaro's slow gastric emptying I hit a point where my stomach goes "yeah, no" and the nausea hits.

I've tried drinking my carbs but damn it everything I try just gives me the spike flavor in my mouth - am I spiking? Not testing. Does it taste like it and make me go "nah, son" - yes. Yes it does. Plus, unfortunately sugar substitutes taste like chemicals and regret to me and many of the liquid options have these.   
But I have seen/read that shakes work for some people. Have you tried? (score: 1)

We use a daily food diary to count every protien, carb and fat and record numbers. It really helps.  Also find new recipes to enjoy and try to use as much whole food as possible. ie, lots of veggies, portioned protiens, avoid packaged foods and chemicals.  If possible, invest in a diabeties dietician to help you.  We've added greek yoghurt and olive oil to his diet because of ours.  Invest in a food scale if you dont already have one.

My nurses explained it all and put me on some good drugs

You need to get a blood glucose monitor, I recommend you jab yourself in the morning when you wake up, before meals and at least 2 hours after meals. 

You can get a continuous glucose monitor but they are more expensive though they are useful for tracking blood sugar throughout the day so you can understand the relationship between food and glucose levels. 

Your hba1c test will get done every three months until your blood sugar is well managed 

This chart is useful, you should aim to be in the green

https://pitstopdiabetes.co.uk/resources/resource/hba1c-chart/

It might take time to reduce and get there 
but don't panic, diabetes can have long term complications if your blood glucose remains high for long periods over a long time if you focus on reducing your blood sugar over the next few months then you are on the way to recovery 

You have to reduce your carb intake, the big four are white versions of rice, pasta, potatoes and bread but that doesn't mean you have to go hungry, starving yourself is unhelpful. Obviously pizza, pastries, crisps are off the table for now. I eat stir fried veg, fish, meat, quark (like Greek yogurt), eggs, cheese, spinach, and I eat chia seed pudding in the mornings (chia seeds, Stevia, cinnamon powder, milk, and almond extract - mix leave in fridge for a couple of hours or overnight). I occasionally eat wholemeal bread - eggs on toast. I switched to Stevia instead of sugar. 

The solution will be a combination of drugs (everyone gets Metformin but there are others too they are all good) and diet and exercise if you can, just walking after meals helps the post meal spike. 

Reducing saturated fats in my diet was really helpful. 

I use an app loseit to track nutrients. It's immensely helpful I aim for 

Carbs - less than 130 grams per day
Sat fats - less than 20 grams per day 
Fibre - at least 30 grams per day (fibre doesn't convert to blood sugar hence chia seeds 90% fibre - they expand so not dry). Hemp hearts are incredible and full of healthy fat and go well with yoghurt or quark. 

When your blood sugar levels are back under control you can reintroduce carbs back into your diet, type 2 diabetics can eat mostly everything in small quantities. 

If you are a habitual snacker or sweet eater you are likely to crave and thats okay just make the distance between snacking longer and longer each time.

- DefyingGeology: Hey, welcome to the club!

First thing: you’re going to be ok. For sure. You’ve got this, it’s manageable.

Second: you don’t have to figure this all out right now. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. Heck, not even a marathon: it’s literally the rest of your life. There’s room to mess things up in the beginning before you get them sorted out!

Third: enjoy your birthday! You’re going to make long term changes and get everything under control, and no single day or single meal is going to kill you. That’s the advantage of type 2 over type 1, to be fair: left unmanaged, T2 makes for a horrible death, but thankfully, it takes a long time to get there, and the fact that you’re here in this group, asking for help, so soon after diagnosis, that’s a really good indicator that you’re not going to be going out that way.

One of my favorite statistics that I’ve read on this journey is that people with t2 who manage it, and keep their glucose under control, actually live longer lives than the general population. So if you want to, you can get this wrapped up and under control and be just fine. 

Last thing, the time frame: the first few weeks are rough and it’s totally ok to go through all the emotions, and shame, and grief or whatever. Then you’ll take a few months to get your best practices in line and under control. By about six months, you’ll see positive results and start testing better and feeling better, and the whole exercise becomes easier and you get more confident about things. So: hang in there. Don’t panic. Keep reading this sub. All the answers are here! And good luck. (score: 4)

- TechTrisHD: What was your A1C?

What I did that "cured" my diabetes was to figure out how my body reacts to what. 

First, I significantly lowered my carb intake. I mainly ate protein and greens. 

Then, I slowly reintroduced healthy carbs and made sure to pair them with protein. Protein helps slow the digestion of sugars. 

Whenever I "cheated" or got caught slacking, I had a cup of protein powder to mix with water, which I would have with my cheat meal. 

For example, a heavy bowl of cereal would cause my blood sugar to hit 180. However, if I have a protein shake before eating the cereal, my blood sugar would only rise to 140. 

I went from type 2 diabetes into remission in one year without any exercise. From 220 pounds down to my college weight of 180. 

Everyone is different, so you really need to track your reactions two hours after every meal until you understand which foods cause you to react in what ways. (score: 4)
  - earthcasey: It was 7.4 today, just crossed the line. It’s so crazy to think that if I never let it cross the line I’d never be considered a diabetic, but once it crosses even if it never does again, then you’re stuck with that label for life (score: 0)

In my case 2% milk is the absolute worst thing, I can drink a can of pop or eat a chocolate bar and my sugar won’t go as high as having a bit of milk.

I started with the good old diabetic plate method. Half a plate non starchy veggies. Quarter plate of complex carbs and a quarter plate of lean protein.

Get active. 10 to 15k steps, 5 days a week, actually makes a difference.

Drinking a lot of water every day helps to flush the sugar out of your body. I drink about a gallon a day. I purchased the premium version of Carb Manager and use the heck out of it. As for your birthday, tell your family you want a fancy piece of protein and excellent non-starchy vegetables for your birthday instead of sweets or cake. That's what I do for mine.

I almost threw up when they told us, even though I’m prepared to get it myself. He still doesn’t want to tell friends and family, he feels guilty that he let it happen (even though that’s not how it works). It’s a normal reaction to be scared at first, but just know, it’s okay. It seems so daunting at first, and we’re only a month in, but it’s just life now. As if he became allergic to sugar suddenly, he wouldn’t be ashamed for that, so he shouldn’t be of diabetes. 

Start small with grilled chicken and salad, add in certain things and test your sugars. Not everything will affect your sugars the same as other people. Carbs don’t affect his sugars at all, but carbs spike my mom’s. Look at keto options, there’s keto cake mixes. We used one, made a poke cake with sugar free strawberry jello, and topped it with sugar free strawberry jam and sugar free whipped topping. 

Pro tip: walk after you eat. You’ll be shocked how much it helps. Like I said, we’re a month in, but he has consistent 90 numbers now. Candy fan? Lily’s has great options.

 What worked for me:
1)Focused on what TO eat, rather than what not to. Cut out most refined carbs and ate smaller portions of other carbs. A podcast on anti inflammatory foods got me to focus on fermented foods (yogurt, tofu, kefir, miso, live sauerkraut....), nuts, beans, fruits and vegetables (especially broccoli and berries), olive oil cocoa powder, curry powder, and chia seeds. 
2) Stopped eating after dinner. That was my overeating time. It took me a month or two to figure out that eating a little after dinner let me to over eating.  Metformin also worked as somewhat of an appetite suppressant at the beginning, which was helpful.
3) Got a continuous glucose monitor. I love feed back, and this told me what individual foods do to my body. Got me out of denial. Started with Dexcom's over the counter one (Stelo). Now using prescription Libre Freestyle 3. They aren't cheap, (Stelo is about $50 for about 15 day sensor. Libre is about $75 with a discount at Fred Meyers because insurance doesn't cover it). But you don't have to use them all the time. Just enough to learn about yourself. They also aren't precise, but definitely close enough to give you a picture.
4) Started walking and water exercise. The effect of aerobic exercise is to decrease insulin resistance, and the effect is visible on your blood sugars

My doctor signed me up for a class on diabetes information. It is a total of 10 hours over 3 days, so we are covering a lot of information. I know different areas will have different programs but you could ask your doctor if there is anything like that available. 

Honestly, I didn't know to ask to go to this class either. I also received word that I have a bunch of food sensitivities around the same time and I messaged my doctor that I didn't know how to eat anymore. It was super overwhelming.

For me, the endos and neuros that I met with didn't have a great deal of exposure to TIND, and it's been a bit of a walk in the woods. One thing to watch out for is muscle loss, which has contributed to some of my tingling and prickling symptoms as well.  (They've shown up in my trunk.) I've found that rebuilding muscle has been more challenging than I expected, so be sure to do that work as well. (score: 1)
- Extreme_Position3853: I'm a more recently diagnosed diabetic (April 2025), but will share my experience with what I believe was TIND:

April- A1C of 14, diagnosed with T2 diabetes. Was ignorant about diabetes at the time, initial symptoms were unintentional weight loss, dry mouth, frequent urination, heavy legs. No feet issues at all yet.

Made immediate changes to diet- heavily cut back on carbs, quit all sugary foods, drinks etc., started taking metformin (and later long-acting insulin)

May- about 5-6 weeks after diagnosis, seeing improvement with my BS, but neuropathy kicks in with my feet. Quickly gets so bad at night that I can't sleep anymore, feet feel like they're on FIRE. Doctor writes a prescription for gabapentin, which helps significantly and allows me to sleep/function again.

October- A1C is down to 4.7 six months after diagnosis. I talk to my doctor and stop taking the gabapentin to see if I can go without it now. It's been 6 weeks without medication and my feet are doing great- sleep is good, no signs of neuropathy anymore. (score: 1)

The laws around it are also complex.

I found a site titled Azerbaijan diabetes league.  Maybe try this?  I can't confirm legitimacy because I don't speak Russian or Azerbaijan.

But they have. Astros listed as http://adl.az

There is also an email:  ngo_adl@mail.ru and a phone 


+994-124980071



Maybe try them? If not them, search for such a group in your own country.  They might have better advice regarding the job situation.  Maybe they have access to resources for free medication or something or test stips so he can treat himself discretely without a true diagnosis.

- Alarmed_Discipline21: As diabetes progresses, it becomes more difficult to "hide".  Hiding really is just avoiding doing things to raise blood sugar.  There is a limit to the amount you can hide it, and honestly, if he is medicated properly and has type 2, it will not be as noticeable.  However, as it becomes more advanced, it will be harder and harder because the highs and lows will become more frequent and extreme, especially without medication., and also even with medication.  

I.e. as a type 1 diabetic, if i eat a bowl of cereal without insulin, my blood sugar will now be 18mmol/L.  Even with insulin, i will still go higher for a period of time than a person without diabetes will.  You can take insulin a head of time to reduce that spike (like 30 min to an hour), that might help a bit, but even with type 2 diabetes, he will eventually have those large spikes after eating.

He needs to be seeing a doctor and getting medicated.  there is no way around it.  I know you asked not to talk about that, but it's impossible to hide diabetes as it progresses if they are testing his sugar. (score: 3)
  - OtherIngenuity5728: I don't think he has diabetes he just has high blood sugar and on levels which is not considered as diabetes but still company doesn't care (score: 1)
    - Alarmed_Discipline21: One of the ways type 2 diabetes is diagnosed is through a glucose tolerance test (GTT).  The longer it takes for blood sugar to return to normal, the more advanced the diabetes is.

You just defined diabetes.  There can be other reasons for high blood sugar, but these are all considered forms of diabetes.

Diabetes is essentially just an impairment of the ability to absorb sugar into the cells, causing blood sugar levels to increase and not return to normal (or even to return to normal more slowly), for several reasons.

If your father is having high blood sugar, he has diabetes.

What I imagine is disputable in your country is how he would be staged.  Or even, how they would try to define diabetes.  But in reality, he has diabetes. (score: 2)
      - OtherIngenuity5728: High blood sugar is not diabetes tho no? 

I don't think he has because he SOMETIMES shows high blood sugar and he is stressed lately so it spiked (score: 1)
        - Alarmed_Discipline21: Here is a definition of diabetes from google:

Diabetes is a chronic condition where the body either doesn't produce enough insulin or can't properly use the insulin it makes, leading to HIGH BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS.

In other words, if you have high blood sugar, you have diabetes.  The fact that you said he got stressed and his sugars went higher just proves this.

- psoriasaurus_rex: If he takes the test while fasting (not eating for at least 8 hours), it will probably be lower.  But that will also depend on how bad his glucose control usually is.

But even if he passes this test, he really needs to treat his diabetes.  The problem is that his high glucose will damage his health over time and can lead to things like heart attack, stoke, kidney disease, amputation and blindness.  If his job doesn’t allow diabetics, he should probably start figuring out a career transition.

  - OtherIngenuity5728: He is not diabetic (score: -2)
- Grouchy_Geezer: Carbohydrates raise blood sugar, especially starchy carbs like potatoes, and grains like wheat, oats, corn, rice.   He should avoid those.   Fruit contains a great deal of fruit sugar, so tell him not to eat fruit or fruit juice.  Sticking with salad seems like a good idea.

Protein doesn't raise blood sugar much, so eating meats would help keep his blood sugar low.   Foods that are considered fats, like butter or cooking oil don't raise blood sugar either.

Exercise can lower blood sugar.  Walking is good.  Other exercises might be even better.

I see that someone here has mentioned avoiding alcohol.  Moderate alcohol can actually prevent blood sugar rising.  it can prevent the liver from releasing stored glucose.  Hard liquor or wine is useful.  Beer should be avoided because it is made from a hops, a starchy carbohydrate.  

He should start eating this way today to keep his level low by tomorrow.  This may help, but I can't guarantee it will lower him enough.   There really aren't good tricks to lower blood sugar.  The best you can hope for is not raising it.  Here in the U.S. personal blood sugar meters are available.  If they're available where you are, it might be helpful to test his blood himself.  I wish you and your dad good luck.

If your dad's blood sugar is high all the time, it will make him sick in the future.  It can make him tired during the day.  I hope he can get proper medical guidance somewhere. (score: 1)

- sleverest: I'm not really sure how they're testing this on the spot as the timing of a blood draw impacts the results greatly. Like, when had he last eaten and what? 

He should definitely see a Dr about this, though. If he's T1, he absolutely needs a Dr to manage. *He could die. *

If he's T2, there's a chance he can do things on his own to manage it, but not every body is the same, so he so may need medical help. 

His diet should be low carb (how low is hotly debated, but 30g carbs per meal and 15g per snack is a popular guide, many people do less). Not all carbs are processed equally. For example, some people don't spike as much from rice as pasta even if the carbs are the same. The only way to know is to test them. Get a glucometer and test before eating and 2 hours after. Google can give you more details on how to test specific foods. 

Excercise. 

My next thing is probably more like an unethical life tip, and it will only work once for a known scheduled blood draw. It might not work at all for everybody and could be dangerous for some people. And it won't work if he's very uncontrolled bc it won't be allowed. Donate Blood, a week in advance, then eat very strictly after. (score: 0)

- BoonOfTheWolf: I don't know if there is such a website, but something to keep in mind. Someone can be 6 feet tall and 300 pounds, but there is a massive difference between mostly muscle versus mostly fat. And just because one medication works well for someone, doesn't mean it will apply to other people. And people's bodies change over time as well. My ex-wife was on Ozempic for a bit and it was working well, but then she started getting side effects and needed to switch to another medication. (score: 2)

The nurse tried to argue that it made the other students uncomfortable when I took my insulin in the cafe. Funny enough, she was the only person who ever told me that. So I went over her head.

You're not cooking your little blob of heroin in a spoon at the table, then using the syringe to draw up the liquid, tying off an arm and injecting into a vein, while sitting on the floor next to a toilet.  🙃

With insulin you draw it from a vial or use a syringe you loaded ahead of time, or use an insulin pen, inject in your stomach, upper arm, or thigh. Less of a production including testing. (score: 1)

I can't say if your insulin consumption is high or low, but being in the 200s all the time isn't good. (score: 3)
  - Ok-Tumbleweed-7378: You’re so right. I dont feel confident or safe taking so much insulin. Im a veteran and I dont have health insurance. I get all my care through my local VA, and there’s only one in my city. I’d love to have new doctors, but I cant as of now. It is what it is. They have my goal at 250. Thats cause I was usually in the 400 and 500s daily. Im in the 200s now and I would like to go lower. Im physically active. I workout. Im 160 pounds, so a little overweight. I just wish there was a way to go lower without taking more insulin. 100 units seems too much already. (score: 4)
    - ASSMDSVD: For context I'm 29, 210, started working out 6 months ago, i run just over 2 units per hour basal, insulin to carb ratio of 1:4 with a target of 110.  I've been a 6.9 once and normally run in the low 7s. An average bg of 250 is an a1c of 9.25ish. Do you have a continuous glocos monitor?

      - Ok-Tumbleweed-7378: I don’t have a continuous glucose monitor. My pump works with a guardian sensor, but it works so horribly that I stopped using it. Ive been healing from a torn rotator cuff and frozen shoulder which made it impossible for me to put the sensor on. Thats part of the reason it wouldn't work correctly. The filament kept bending when I tried to put it on because I didn't have the strength to push the inserter. My arm is mostly healed now.

- rattlinsabre: Here's a suggestion; it's just that, but you can try it to get a better idea of what you need.

Pick a meal that you like and can be relatively certain the carbs in it. Eat it once, take your normal amount of insulin and write down your numbers before, and every 30 minutes throughout for the next 4 hours. Also include your activity level. 

If you spike into the 200s and have relatively low activity, try it again with a single variable change -- either be more active or take more insulin, write it down again.

Try it at least half a dozen times. Your goal is to get incremental changes that are better, not bomb your sugar levels. 

You'll get better at guestimating what you need, when, and how long it'll take. Eventually, you'll be able to take a bit more insulin or have more activity and not have to worry about dropping low.

Something I hadn't seen since being on Byretta from 2005 to 2010. 

But thankfully things have changed, I've gotten down to around 20u a day of u200 Humalog and and as of last week I'm finally down to 160u of U200 Trisba after being on 1mg for the past 13 months. 

I was told decades ago that there is no Normal when it comes to how much insulin a person needs, as that varies from person to person and that what you need to take is what you need to take and that is what is normal for you. 

Though sadly insulin resistance can play a big factor in how much insulin one might need to take as the resistance makes it harder for the body to use the insulin it makes or is given effectively. (score: 1)

As far as I know they never did a test to see which one I was. The last time my endo brought up the topic she said it doesn’t matter what type I am because the treatment is the same (insulin, exercise, diet). We haven't discussed it since then.

I'd be running from that Dr.  Not only there is a difference in treatment between T1 &amp; T2, there is a uniqueness in treatment within each type, especially on insulin. Insulin itself is unique in dosing. It's not like other meds that might come in 5 or 6 dose strengths. Say 1k diabetics, 1k different dosing combinations.

- ___Dan___: Yes. I found that the pump automations for exercise all completely suck. I have custom profiles with reduced basal and increased sensitivity for exercise. Depending on the intensity of the exercise I need the reduced basal for hours after I’m done. It’s taken over a decade of tinkering to figure this out and make it better. I learned that, at least for me, issues you describe like rapidly falling blood glucose during exercise are nearly always caused by too much basal insulin. (score: 1)
- Due_Citron6089: It doesn’t happen the same way in manual mode coz you’re [probably] using a much lower basal rate in manual mode. You might want to consider suspending delivery completely while doing strenuous exercise.

Is it possible to not get carbs quickly enough? Depends on the person, but yes for me [too]. If I don’t get a ~1/2-hour head-start on my carb requirement, it’s a low for me. Stopping to recover for sure for me too - cycling while woozy isn’t recommended… (score: 1)

- ExtensionBaseball957: Hi! I’m a 23 year old Diabetic that was diagnosed at 18 and only now started taking care of myself properly!

I went through a long stage of denial and grief where I knew I needed insulin, but would refuse to take it. My a1c stayed around 9 for years, and I finally got it down to high 6-low 7.

I hated every part about this disease(still do) and hated even wearing a pump/cgm. My biggest change that I made to adjust my overall health is to just take the time to as closely as possible guess my bolus and stop being afraid of taking too much.  I was a big snack girl, and changing to 3 meals a day made a huge difference for me as well. 

I don’t know if you are on a pump yet, but it makes your life so much easier. If you forget a bolus, it will act as a last line of defense to bring your sugar back down. Instead of using a pen, you can deliver insulin through an app on your phone so it’s much more convenient. 

If you ever need someone to rant to or ask questions, I always love to talk and my dms are open! (score: 1)
  - Icy_Excitement6750: Thank you so much &lt;3 yeah my doctor told me about the cgm/pump but he also said that it’s not very easy to get them since they can be expensive (I’m from Argentina I don’t know if it’s the same for every country) but I will try as soon as I can. Also I’m not very happy to have to use them but at least I would be a lot more calm. I used to eat a lot too, are you like having lunch two times a day? And do you eat at the same time every day? (I don’t have a very structured rutine but I guess it helps to control levels)

It’s been a lot of changes in a very short time, but at least I found a food market with keto options, that’s very comforting. For the time being Im thinking about using a calendar to register every time I do it and see if that helps (I register my levels but not the insulin). Thank you again, I’ll probably message you again :’) lol (score: 2)
    - ExtensionBaseball957: I don’t eat at the same time every day because it’s a little impossible with my schedule. I was taught to take insulin 15 minutes before I eat and I find for me that works pretty well to keep me level. I normally only eat three times a day, but if I do add another meal in there, I bolus the same as I would normally and it doesn’t really affect me. 

The pump is nice, but the CGM really is the one that makes all the difference. It takes away the need to finger prick, so you can see what your blood sugar is at all times and which way it’s trending. (score: 2)
      - Icy_Excitement6750: Same, I’m eating at different hours but I don’t know yet how it affects my levels, I’m going to the nutritionist this week to learn more about it, and I take insulin very close to eating because the doctor didn’t specify a time to wait for it, I’ll ask him about it.
 
Ohh great I’ll try to get a cgm soon, thank you! (score: 1)
    - Argentinian_Penguin: If you have been diagnosed as T1, you have the right to access to CGMs. I'm from Buenos Aires and my health insurance pays for it. [It's your right](https://www.boletinoficial.gob.ar/detalleAviso/primera/275958/20221116).

I don't use a pump, and I don't want one either. I'm doing well being on MDI. But the CGM is life-changing. I can monitor my bg on almost real-time, and make decisions based on the information it provides. It also shows the trend, so that I get an idea of how fast my bg is changing, and act accordingly.

Using a CGM saved me from hypos that otherwise would've been very dangerous. I don't tend to feel the hypo until my bg is on the 50s.

EDIT (I'll write this part in Spanish since OP is from Argentina): Un truco que uso para nunca olvidarme de darme insulina es poner una alarma, y siempre inyectarme a esa hora. Por ejemplo, yo me doy la basal a las 21:00. Inmediatamente después de inyectarme lo anoto en la aplicación MySugr. Esa app me viene bárbaro porque también cada vez que me mido con el glucómetro los datos se cargan ahí. También la uso para anotar las comidas, y las inyecciones con insulina rápida. 

La diabetes no te va a impedir nada en tu vida. Pero sí es fundamental tener disciplina. Al principio puede sentirse como un golpe duro, pero ya te vas a acostumbrar.

Y después si, yo también llegué a tener 59 y me asusté pero por suerte me habían dicho que podía pasar y lo pude resolver. Mi tema ahora es tener siempre tiras reactivas porque estoy corta (score: 1)
        - Argentinian_Penguin: Jajajaj, justo te escribí en castellano en el último edit que hice.

Sí, no te niego que vas a tener que pelearlo. Pero vale la pena. Y cada vez es más común y se van volviendo más accesibles.

No sé si tenés obra social o prepaga. Pero sí, tenés que llenar una planilla y presentarla. Si mal no recuerdo, para que a mí me tomaran definitivamente el diagnóstico de diabetes T1 tuve que hacerme el análisis de anticuerpos (creo que se llaman anti-GAD). Si tu diabetólogo todavía no los pidió, te recomiendo que le preguntes si te los puede pedir. Tengo entendido que eso es lo que da la garantía de que es T1 y no otro tipo de diabetes.

Tiras reactivas también te tienen que dar. Siempre intentá que te pidan un poco más de lo que realmente vayas a usar porque... puede que las termines necesitando. A mí además de darme los sensores también me dan tiras, y la verdad que las sigo usando. Los sensores no siempre son precisos, y a veces me pasó que fallaron y tuve que usar tiras (igual, te cambian la vida).

Si necesitás alguna info más, o querés charlar sobre el tema preguntame. A mí también me diagnosticaron este año. Pero como te dije en el otro comentario, la diabetes no te impide nada. Es cuestión de organizarse y cuidarse. Con el conteo de carbohidratos puedo comer de todo (aunque siempre con moderación). Con el tiempo ya vas a ir aprendiendo todas estas estrategias, y vas a ir viendo como reacciona tu cuerpo. No a todos todas las comidas nos pegan igual por ejemplo. (score: 1)
          - Icy_Excitement6750: Ah bien, no sabía lo de los anticuerpos, por ahora solo me hice análisis de sangre (una vez que salí de la internacion, ahí adentro me hicieron mil cosas, no se si entre ellas me lo habrán hecho) y el doctor me dijo que le lleve la planilla. Ahora cuando lo vea le digo. Y tengo obra social, ahora en breve les voy a enviar la planilla y demás, pero ni idea que cantidad de cosas tengo que pedir por el momento solo me dijeron que envíe los documentos. 
Uh si leí que los sensores no eran tan precisos, no sabía qué tan asi era. Por ahora uso un glucometro que me dieron pero me intrigaba también si entre marcas podía variar los valores, mas que nada porque el que me dieron tiene tiras reactivas bastante caras y vi que otras marcas son mas accesibles (en caso de tener que comprar por urgencia) vos probaste mas de un glucometro?

Y gracias de verdad, hoy escribiendo esto me puse a llorar porque todavía me angustia la situación pero de apoco voy acostumbrándome, tampoco conozco a nadie que tenga asi que hablarlo me re ayuda (score: 1)
            - Argentinian_Penguin: Dudo que te hayan pedido el anti-GAD en la internación. A mí ese me lo pidió un diabetólogo después. En la internación te deben haber medido otras cosas, como el ph de la sangre.

Lo de la precisión de los sensores es variable. La mayor parte del tiempo me resultan bastante precisos. Pero otras veces miden lejos de lo que realmente es. Por eso siempre hay que tener tiras reactivas.

Tema glucómetro: en teoría cuando ya termines los trámites las tiras reactivas te las debería cubrir tu obra social. El tema es que te las van a dar para el glucómetro que ellos elijan. Yo tengo varios glucómetros, y los he comparado también, y todos me miden más o menos parecido. Pero solo uso el Accu-check guide porque la prepaga me da las tiras para ese. Cuando salí de la internación por un tiempo usé el Maverick, hasta que se me acabaron las tiras, y me anduvo bien.

Otra cosa que está bueno tener más adelante es un medidor de cetonas. Ese no me lo cubrió la prepaga, pero si me cubre las tiras. Me compré el FreeStyle Optium Neo. Es útil prestarle atención a las cetonas cuando uno está enfermo o si pasás mucho tiempo con la glucemia muy alta. Pero eso charlalo más adelante con tu diabetólgo.

Me alegro de que algo de esto te pueda ayudar. De verdad, con el tiempo vas a poder llevarlo bien. Además, con la cantidad de avances que hay, yo creo que vamos a ser la última generación en tener diabetes tipo 1 (también tengo 23). No solo hablo de que eventualmente vamos a llegar al punto donde se puedan restaurar las células y evitar que el sistema inmune las mate, sino que mientras tanto, con toda la tecnología que tenemos, es mucho más fácil llevar esta enfermedad hoy que hace 20 años. Y hay cosas que todavía no llegaron acá a la Argentina. Pero si mirás lo que hay afuera, las bombas como Omnipod son impresionantes. Es un cosito que va en el brazo y te va dando la insulina según necesitás de manera automática.

Así que tranqui, al principio es abrumador todo lo que hay que aprender, pero después vas a ir llevando una vida cada vez más normal, y muchas cosas te van a salir automáticas. Recomiendo que también vayas con algún nutricionista si todavía no fuiste. Ordenar la alimentación ayuda mucho. Yo, por ejemplo, siempre como primero alguna verdura (como zanahoria rallada, o espinaca), y después recién como lo que tenga carbohidratos. Así me impacta menos.

Ya te enseñaron a hacer conteo de carbohidratos con la insulina rápida?

EDIT: fijate si después no podés pedir reintegro de las tiras reactivas y demás insumos que compraste. A mí la prepaga me reintegró las insulinas que habíamos pagado de nuestro bolsillo ni bien salí de la internación. (score: 1)
              - Icy_Excitement6750: A mi también me dieron el accu check guide asi que por el momento me manejo con ese
Lo del medidor de cetonas no sabía ni que existía le voy a preguntar al doctor, la verdad hay mucho que no se jajaj gracias por decirme
Y sii, mi mamá me dijo lo mismo, seguro en el futuro haya forma de curarlo y también que hoy existen mil cosas que antes no, como los parches por ej, y no se yo estos días encontré un lugar de comidas keto que antes no se veía. El doctor dijo que tiene pacientes bailarinas o deportistas asi que yo que no hago nada debería estar joya, pero soy bastante dramática lo admito
Ya saqué turno para nutricionista y también me recomendaron ir al psicólogo lo cual seguro haga para descargar un poquito pero en realidad cuando estoy tranquila se que es todo manejable
No me explicaron el conteo de carbohidratos pero seguro que la nutricionista me dice supongo
Uh buenísimo voy a ver si puedo pedir reintegros, por suerte creo que mi obra social está bastante bien, la internacion fue bastante buena (aunque solo tengo malos recuerdos me salvaron la vida) 
Después tengo dudas sobre un par de efectos secundarios que tuve aunque el doctor dijo que son normales por ser todo tan abrupto pero viste que hay ciertas complicaciones
Me imagino los yankis leyendo todo esto sin entender nada (score: 1)
                - Argentinian_Penguin: Jajaja, les tomamos el sub a los yankis.
Sii, hay deportistas de altísimo nivel que tienen diabetes tipo 1. Si mal no recuerdo había uno que participó en los juegos olímpicos. Podés googlearlo.

Me parece bien que vayas a algún psicólogo si sentís que lo necesitás. Es todo muy reciente y te puede dar herramientas para procesarlo (recomiendo que NO sea psicoanalista!! Cognitivo-conductual mejor).

Yo te puedo ir compartiendo mi experiencia si te sirve, pero lo que más te va a servir es encontrar un equipo de médicos con el que estés cómoda. No necesariamente tenés que quedarte con el primer diabetólogo que te atienda.

En resumidas cuentas, el conteo de carbohidratos es esto: según la cantidad de carbohidratos que una comida tenga, te aplicás cierta cantidad de insulina. Yo me doy 1 unidad de insulina rápida cada 15g. Por ejemplo, si me como 5 galletitas de agua (20g de carbohidratos aprox) yo me doy 1 unidad. Ojo que esto no es igual para todos, y puede ir cambiando. Pero es simplemente para que veas lo que es. Eso es lo que me permite por ejemplo comer torta o alfajorcitos de maicena jajaja. Sí es muy importante ser ordenado con esto.

Ya que tenés el accu-check guide, te recomiendo de nuevo que te instales la app MySugr. Te va a servir por dos razones: lo primero es que vas a poder sincronizar lo que te mide el glucómetro con el celu. Lo segundo es que es la app que uso para anotar cada vez que me inyecto insulina, y que uso para anotar lo que como (podés hasta sacarle foto a la comida y guardarla ahí). Esos registros son útiles para ver cómo te pega cada cosa. Y lo de anotar las inyecciones es FUNDAMENTAL. Si en algún momento dudás de si te diste o no la insulina, solo tenés que ir a la app y fijarte. Yo anoto ahí ni bien me inyecto.

Solo si querés contarme, qué efectos secundarios tenés? Estoy haciendo memoria y no recuerdo ninguno en particular de la internación. Sí tuve efectos secundarios de la cetoacidocis, pero se me fueron relativamente rápido una vez que arranqué con la insulina.

A vos cuándo te diagnosticaron? Fue este mes? (score: 1)

- Healthy-Zebra-9856: Ask his doctor to run a full metabolic and nutritional panel — including A1C, fasting insulin, kidney function, testosterone (total &amp; free), vitamin D, and B12. Older men with long-standing diabetes often have low testosterone and poor nutrient absorption, which can cause rapid muscle loss.

Many diabetics undereat protein out of fear of raising glucose. But protein minimally affects blood sugar and helps protect lean mass. Aim for 1.2–1.6 g per kg body weight daily, from sources like eggs, poultry, fish, whey isolate, Greek yogurt, tofu, etc.

Whey isolate in particular is quick-digesting and shown to improve glucose control and muscle recovery when paired with resistance exercise.

Even 15–20 minutes a few times per week makes a big difference. Bodyweight exercises or resistance bands can help reactivate muscle growth, improve insulin sensitivity, and stabilize blood sugar.

As for supplements etc.

* **Magnesium glycinate or citrate** – supports insulin signaling
* **Creatine monohydrate (3 g/day)** – safe for most people with normal kidney function and helps preserve strength.  Any company that sells CreaPure certified. eg. NutriCost, which has both certified &amp; non-certified.  Choose CreaPure.
* **Omega-3 (krill oil)** – anti-inflammatory and supports muscle protein synthesis.  Krill Oil gets absorbed much better than fish oils.
* **Vitamin D3 + K2** – helps muscle and bone strength
* **HMB (β-Hydroxy-β-Methylbutyrate)** This is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine that directly reduces muscle protein breakdown. It’s one of the few supplements with strong evidence in older adults and people losing muscle from inactivity or chronic disease. Typical dose: **3 g per day**, split in two or three doses. It’s safe, doesn’t affect glucose, and works best when combined with light resistance training and adequate protein intake. I use NatureBell (Amazon)
* **L-Glutamine** Glutamine is conditionally essential during illness or metabolic stress, and diabetics often have lower plasma glutamine levels. It helps maintain intestinal integrity, supports immune function, and can modestly aid recovery after workouts. However, for pure muscle-building purposes, it’s not as potent as HMB or creatine. Think of it more as a “recovery and gut health” amino acid. Typical dose: **5–10 g once or twice daily**, ideally between meals or post-workout. I use MicroIngredients (Amazon)

If his kidney function is normal, HMB, L\_Glutamine &amp; Creatine can be used safely — but HMB will have the most direct effect on preventing further muscle loss, while glutamine helps overall recovery and glucose stability under stress. (score: 3)

The problem is there’s so much misinformation out there. Everyone focuses on carbs and blood sugar spikes, but few realize that fat plays a big role too. Sure, fat doesn’t directly raise blood sugar, but saturated fat can make your body more insulin resistant, which is what leads to those stubborn numbers. Hepatic insulin resistance is the main reason for Dawn phenomenon.

So far I write all my food consumption indicate carbs and proteins, write how I feel and weight plus I send her the glycemic report out of my Contour reader.   I also have access to some capsules (links on subjects) on diabetics which I listened to.   Plus other issues Psoriasis, blatter control, thyroid, cholesterol, bipolar disorder (under control).  I have a new one which is neuropathy and have chronic pain since June.  Tried many pain relief pills and to no avail.   In this publication I thought I had understood the relation with recommended carbs and no carbs on my blood sugar.  This was a total miss.   I am on supplements (in case it helps).   Ok I will stop ranting.  I just need to take control.  Thanks for taking the time to advise. (score: 1)

- ShimmeryPumpkin: There is something called reactive hypoglycemia. This can be its own stand alone condition I think or it can be connected to diabetes. When it's connected to diabetes, what happens is your blood sugar goes too high right after eating and then crashes down a couple hours later. This can happen because the body senses it's not responding to the high blood sugar and then pumps out all the insulin it can, and then the insulin kicks in and causes the blood sugar to drop too much. This can happen because of LADA (slow onset type 1 in adults) or fluctuating insulin resistance (ie you did some exercise after eating that lowered your insulin resistance so all the insulin your body was pumping out could suddenly work effectively). You can pick up a blood glucose meter over the counter at the pharmacy/drug store to check your own blood sugar throughout the day if you are concerned, then bring those numbers to your primary doctor.

You should have been eating a protein along with that coke because you're just going to keep rollercoastering with reactive hypoglycemia.  

Sorry to be blunt, but I think your post is less about warning people to be prepared for lows than it is a cautionary tale for really BAD food choices.  If you want pancakes, fine...but use a sugar free syrup.  And have some bacon to blunt the spike.  And go for a walk afterward (with glucose tabs in your pocket).  Positioning this as "friendly advice" is a disservice to people new to the community because you are seemingly blaming the disease rather than some really dumb food choices.

My opinion? If you have your last meal at 8pm and then your next one at 6/7/8am, that is all the fasting your body needs.


I'd suggest you go back to a more normal regiment of eating (3-4 meals a day) and control your BG via good food choices and regular exercise if possible. If not, it might be worth thinking about medication. While it is great if you can control diabetes via dietary choices/changes, these shouldn't be so extreme as to cause additional issues.


However it is important to keep in mind something else entirely could be causing your current issues.

- Healthy-Zebra-9856: Wow that's a lot to unpack here.  For starters, burghers &amp; pizzas etc are only going to make things worse.  When you have insulin resistance, anything that is processed or things like potatoes will spike.  When you consume saturated fats from hamburgers, bacon etc.  the fat from it creates insulin resistance in your liver.  So you will see high fasting glucose.  Also, this fat clogs up your muscles and prevents it from absorbing the glucose leading to muscular insulin resistance.  These are very simplified versions of what is actually happening. 

You need to chose lean meats with as low saturated fats as possible. Even dairy like cheese etc, you can start by choosing low fat versions.  The more you avoid these things, the better it is.  I would eat chicken, fish of any kind, some eggs like not more than 3, plenty of veggies etc.  I know you said you are disabled but you can do resistance training and star with focus on your biceps, triceps, chest.  There are also back friendly leg exercises you can pickup.  Muscles act as supplemental glucose stores, burns fat  &amp; improves metabolism. Also, some light 30 minute cardio in the morning on an empty stomach &amp; walking for 30 minutes after your meal will help immensely.

To make your life easy, look into getting an Instant Pot &amp; an Air fryer. 

You can not tackle this with diet alone, you have to do a lifestyle change to include exercises to build muscles &amp; burn fat.

Feel free to ask any questions. (score: 12)
  - GrantAZ: Thanks for the tips and info!  It’s very helpful!  I do have an InstaPot but really only use it to cook my monthly chili.  6 cups of dried pinto beans cooked in the InstaPot then add 1.5 pounds of hamburger and spices and it feeds me for 5 days and is delicious.  I usually cheat though and add in brown sugar, bbq sauce and sour cream.   I’ll have to not add the sugar or sour cream and see if it works with my blood monitor. (score: 1)
    - Dgskydive: Highly suggest you speak to a dietician ASAP. Most insurance covers them for free. I had to calling me 3 times a week after I got diagnosed. 

Insulin alone doesnt control diabetes. Its a tool you use. The real medicine is in a proper diet and excerise, along with meds. The better your diet and excerise. The less meds you will probably need. 

No more pizza. No more burgers. No pasta. Stay away from most breads. Eat lean proteins. Non starchy veggies. Complex carbs in moderation. Figure out a sustainable calorie deficit to lose weight.

Im 6'1. I was 250. Now im 185. You, probably want to be 175 or so. Make good choices and you can. (score: 8)
    - Healthy-Zebra-9856: Try ground turkey instead of ground beef. If you must, you can add the low-fat sour cream. Of all the air fryers, I got a $40 GoWise air fryer that I use pretty much every single time. There’s always a low fat and healthy alternative to everything that you cook. Now remember good fats like olive oil, avocado oil, walnuts, etc. are very essential. (score: 3)
- Icy_Excitement6750: Hi, I just been diagnosed and the doctors at the hospital told me to avoid carbs ( not completely because it could cause abstinence to change my levels so abruptly) and before knowing I ate carbs all the time, so yeah you have to eat meat and salads ( or integral versions of pasta for example) but you can do it in big portions. Also I’ve been replacing sweet treats with keto (no sugar diet) options so look for those products to satisfy that need. But I highly recommend you to avoid burgers and pizza (at least until you have normal levels of glucose) because it’s very bad for this condition. And yeah, for me it’s also very uncomfortable to not have quick options, but I’m sure you are going to find a place that sells healthy options for you, I hope it happens soon :) (score: 3)
- Sad-Committee-1870: Unfortunately burgers, pizza and baked potatoes are crazy for a diabetic. 

Don’t eat “plain” chicken thighs, put some seasoning on it lol. Avoid high sugar sauces like bbq.  (there are some good sugar free ones though)
Veggies need to be relatively low carb. A good general rule for veggies is if it grows above ground it’s usually ok to eat (there are exceptions, like corn, corn won’t do you any favors). 
Look up easy low carb or keto foods, SLOWLY introduce carbs back in (but only a small amount and only one thing at a time to see how your body reacts, the CGM is going to be a huge help with this). Even if you get spikes, it’s ok, spikes are normal even for nondiabetics, as long as the spike goes down sub 140 after 1 hour that spike is fine and normal. I understand that right now you may not ever be 140 so just… as long as it goes back down to wherever you started within 60 minutes of the spike you’re on the right track. Eventually your baseline will lower, but it takes time and work. You can do this, but get rid of the Carby foods. Donate them (sell them to a family member/friend if you have to lol) and get better food for you. 
You know the food pyramid? This doesn’t really apply to you anymore. Try to focus on how you plate your food, go for 1/4 (give or take) lean protein (don’t forget to season!) and the 3/4 of your plate be low carb veggies. If you HAVE to have a carb right now, do it, but severely limit it until you get your baseline to something normal. By limit I mean really limit, 1-2 bites of ice cream MAX, 1/2 a small roll, a single very very small potato. But honestly until you can get that baseline down I’d avoid carbs as much as possible - reintroduce them slowly once you’re out of “I-feel-like-shitsville” 24/7. (score: 2)
  - GrantAZ: Thanks for the tips!  I made my chicken thighs plain so I could give some to my pets as treats. I usually hit them with salt, pepper and garlic powder but wanted to test just plain on the monitor.  It actually made my glucose drop from 210 to 180 so I was kind of shocked.  I was still kind of shaky and I was still hungry though after eating 4 thighs.  It just wasn’t quenching my appetite.  I know I have to get used to it. (score: 1)
    - Sad-Committee-1870: You were still hungry because your body is used to having the carbs. Ever hear that old stereotype where you eat a crap ton of Chinese buffet but then you’re hungry an hour later? It’s from the carbs and sugar. It makes your “hunger hormone” rise. After a few days of limiting carbs you’ll find smaller meals will make you full, and keep you full… for HOURS, but it takes time (not too much as long as you keep it up though and don’t cheat). You’ll eventually kinda detox from the carb cravings/hunger noise after a while of doing this. 

HOWEVERRRR. Since you’re getting shaky sub 180, add a good carb to your meal. A complex carb. An example is a sweet potato, not a white potato. It’s going to spike you, but it won’t be as bad as a simple carb (like potatoes, sugar, pasta, bread, etc.) Don’t cut the carbs out as much as I stated before because we don’t need you passing out, friend. But really be picky on the carbs you eat right now but make it like “a single serving”, not a lot. If you still feel shaky after several minutes please get one more serving. (Pay attention to packaging, servings are much smaller than you’d think!). Don’t overcorrect or you’ll be back in bed feeling like a grumpy poop again. 

Once you can get below sub 180 pretty consistently and not feel woozy, you can toy with removing carbs a bit more, get your baseline lower, then you can work on testing the types of carbs slowly back into your diet to see what your body can or can’t handle. 

I’ll give an example, pasta: for me I can handle egg noodles fine without crazy spikes (serving or two max though), but regular white pasta or even wheat pasta does me in, I don’t understand it, but that’s what my body does. Rice is a no go in ANY form, we are talking all day up and down spikes because of one meal with rice, takes forever to digest and break down.  (I’ve gotten used to riced cauliflower so much at this point that I actually prefer it lol). Sometimes if I double up my protein I can get away with more carbs, but it also depends on the carb. Having your CMG on always is essential to these trials, but you’ll figure it out eventually. Just listen to your body and how it reacts to things, and eventually you’ll know what you can eat without giving you those awful side effects and spikes. 

It’s frustrating, making this change, and you’re probably gonna get mad a lot (I did, still do sometimes), but it’s important not to doom yourself to the slowest most miserable suicide by carbs. Watched my mom and uncle both do it, believe me oh my god you don’t want any part of that shit. (score: 4)
      - GrantAZ: Thank you!  Your insight is spot on.  I’ve already learned a lot just having the monitor on for 8 days. (score: 2)
        - Sad-Committee-1870: Good luck, we are here if you have questions, there’s no stupid questions either so just keep asking. 

You’re so lucky to have that CGM, I’ve been diabetic for about 15 years, finger sticks were the worst, I was never good at keeping up with it, CGMs are a lifesaver and gamechanger for real. You’ll get this down in no time with some discipline and self monitoring. :) (score: 2)
    - CD274: That's normal. It'll be like that for a few months minimum. It'll get better, you will feel better.  So what really helped me is protein shakes (no sugar/substitutes) and fiber (psyllium husk).  Especially before any meals with carbs in them. Or eat a LOT of fibrous vegetables (I ate broccoli salad and cole slaw a lot).

   The first few months are very hard and you will feel hungry a lot. Later on you will start to associate hunger after eating with your blood sugar shooting up. Weirdly because your cells can't use a lot of the carbs you eat, and it's in your blood / urine you get hungrier after eating carbs.

You may be able to eat some carbs not others. Like I can eat noodles even normal ones not just lower carb stuff like Goodles decently. Can't eat rice easily. It's all very individual.

But early on you should reduce everything then slowly reintroduce it one at a time to see what affects you and how much.  I promise you you will feel better, and you will stop falling asleep and have more energy.  Some meds may make you nauseated so that helps not wanting to eat too unfortunately lol.

The shakes? And if you feel cold and dizzy? Will be blood sugar changes especially blood sugar drops. Your body is used to high sugar so any big drop will feel strange.  You will feel like someone with low blood sugar even if it's still high blood sugar like 180 because you're not used to it 

Also take B12, vitamin D, magnesium supplements. We're deficient in those usually and meds like metformin reduce them more. And it I'll help you with energy, sleep, and feeling better. (score: 2)
- coffeecatsandtea: Please do not go through all your high carb food before switching to low carb. I understand you don't want to waste the food you have, but it's going to be that much more difficult adjusting to a low/er carb diet if you're eating nothing BUT carbs and processed food right now. Mix the high carb food with lower carb sides as you play with recipes and figure out what alternatives work for you. 

A fasting reading of 180 is pretty high - that's actually the peak/highest reading most endocrinologists want diabetics to see post-meal. Ideally you'd want a fasting reading between 80-100, but it may take time and effort to get there because you don't want too drastic of a drop - you may feel a false low/hypo as your levels drop because your body isn't used to what that feels like. A reading of 350+ is high and there's too much sugar in your system, which is why you feel tired/sleepy. 

I'm not sure where you're located, but (I'm in the US) there are some affordable low carb meals to make. Some require meal prep, or waiting for sales on certain products and stocking up if you can. In the summer I eat a lot of salads, topped with protein (usually frozen chicken strips); now that it's getting colder I'll make soup at home. Healthy Choice has low carb steamed frozen meals that are actually pretty decent; sometimes I'll add extra veggies like broccoli or bell peppers. Frozen veggies are just as good as fresh produce, and worth it if you don't get through produce before it spoils.

If you can start working in daily movement, that will also help with managing your blood sugar levels, especially after meals. Walk in place/pace around your home if walking outside isn't safe, and aim to increase how long you move every day/week. If mobility is an issue, maybe movements/exercises you can do while seated/laying down. (score: 2)

An idea my dietician gave me is to start adding (low carb) stuff in the beginning instead of subtracting existing carbs. So like add a bunch of broccoli or other fiber to an existing meal to start. That made it easier for me to adjust.

- Consistent_Elk9676: Quick answer-yes uncontrolled blood sugar absolutely can make you tired. That sugar is not getting into your cells so they don’t get energy. 

By the same token you are eating foods that cause spikes in your blood sugar. Since you are not using the blood sugar effectively it it just more for your kidneys to try to flush out, so you are in a cycle that just gets you further and further down.

The Dietician spent the 20 minute meeting explaining diabetes as an analogy of women going out to a club but wanting a man to go with them in an even pattern but there were “bouncers” that stopped the men from going.  It was an amusing analogy to hear but a little strange for our first visit.  She asked me what I wanted from her and I said “help me put together a grocery list of items I can buy (from Costco mainly, I’m in Arizona) that will not spike my blood glucose and are easy to make (for me).  I’m a decent cook but too tired and in pain (back) to stand for long so it has to be fast.”  She said eat meats, veggies and more specifically as that was what I wanted, a spiral ham and low carb frozen dinners.  I said I was trying to avoid processed foods and nitrates and she said to not follow that rule and just eat lower carb meals right now to get some control.

I inadvertently fasted today from 3am to 3pm because I was exhausted and couldn’t get out of bed.  I also had a terrible headache.  My glucose went down to 183.  I then had to eat so had a yogurt 8gcarbs and it went up to 208.  Then a few hours later I had to eat something and finished off the last of my ramen 128gcarbs (I know.  Extremely bad but that’s all I had) which spiked it to 327.  I’m completely out of food and just trying to get enough energy to shop at Costco.

Go to the library and look for reputable resources and educate yourself.

I have no tips for you. We're all different and while we appear to have a lot in common I don't know what your disability means for you. I have back issues but consider myself "annoyed" by them, not fully disabled. I work around it. But my course was lifestyle overhaul. Eating, activity, and sleep.

I went all-in: while I don't strictly count calories or carbs I'm mindful of them. I tightly manage portion control and make meals with low-medium glycemic load. I don't eat meat at all so I adopted a whole food, plant based diet. I informally do intermittent fasting, not eating until 10am and generally not eating after 7pm. While I eat for nourishment I'm a pretty good cook so am generally always satisfied with the taste. I've learned to adapt and eat normal portions which meant getting comfortable not gorging myself like I did before, or mindlessly eating until the plate was empty... or container...

I dropped over 100lbs in a year and my back issues are all-but-gone. I need to get checked out by the neurologist again, and likely still have the condition, but it's not causing me debilitating pain anymore. I wasn't able to do stairs and now I go up and down 7 flights without issue. But I started just going down 1 flight at first. Then up 1, down 2. 

It wasn't easy at first, and sure wasn't fun. Embrace the suck and it quickly passes. (score: 2)

It's been a long time since then, but I'm re-learning with video courses and books from Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming ([YMAA](http://www.ymaa.com)). Between Udemy and their own website, it can be done pretty easily. 

It'll help a LOT that you have some in-person experience, because you'll have at least some framework for understanding what's being taught.

I suggest that you pick up the "applications" video courses pretty soon in you go this route - having a strong understanding of the *why* of the movements really helps with learning and remembering them!

Another resource to know about is [TaijiWorld](http://www.TaijiWorld.com), the website of the Erle Montaigue family. Erle passed away, but his son has been managing their global network pretty well. Erle was reportedly the first foreigner recognized as a master at WuDang, the origin of Taiji, and was instrumental in raising global awareness of the art "back in the day". (score: 1)

It helps me to think about high blood sugar (anything above 130mg/dL) as a kind of "injury", and not taking care of it, or being negligent about foods, is then a kind of *self harm* \- a slow-burn suicide that makes literally everything worse along the way.

And keeping it all going as permanent life change. 

In January, my A1C was 7.9, 10 years ago when I was first diagnosed, it was 10.9. In between, I'd brought it down and gotten "here" within a year, but then I got sloppy and casual about it, stopped tracking things, and everything came back. In January of this year, an unrelated medical emergency brought me into the ER, and my sugars were over 250! It was a "second wake up call", and I'm now re-committed to never stopping with meal, weight, and sugar tracking to keep me honest. (score: 2)

- Mrs123wife: Diabetes is a lifelong management strategy. You can have bad days, but whatever you did to avoid medication and lower your a1c, get used to it because it's what you'll need to do for the rest of your life. That's why it pisses me off so much when people say that it's the "good" type of diabetes. It's not. None of them are. Management takes complete dedication. There is no such thing as reversal of diabetes, only remission, which is also rare and difficult. The longer you go with high blood sugars, the more damage is done to your pancreas and eventually, it doesn't come back from that and you'll require insulin. 

Long story short: Getting your a1c down to 6 is incredible. You should be proud of yourself. Keeping it there will take a lot of work. There is no magic cure, no quick fix, etc. The fad diets are not sustainable. It's not impossible. You will have times when you slip up. But as long as you continue working on your health, you'll be okay. You need to prioritize your health. If you want to have a burger, have it, but pair it with a walk after you eat it. If you want ice cream, eat it, but add some protein beforehand and a short walk. This has to be your priority.

- alexmbrennan: Glucagon (injections or nasal spray) causes the liver to dump all the stored glucose into your blood to raise BG levels quickly, but this also makes hypos more likely while glucose stores are being refilled. 

For that reason, you need to eat extra carbs [as per the manufacturer's website](https://www.baqsimi.com/): "When you are able to safely swallow food or drink, your caregiver should give you a fast-acting source of sugar (such as a regular soft drink or fruit juice) and a long-acting source of sugar (such as crackers with cheese or peanut butter)."

Also, glucagon may not work until stores are refilled so you need to be very careful to avoid hypos following glucagon use.

&gt; I entered a long 1-2 hour phase of constant hypo where i wasn’t able to eat.

I am not sure I understand what you mean by that. (score: 6)
  - AbleTime5905: Ty mate I generally have no hypo now I have 4-5 every day even though I stop using my Novorapid i am so tired and I try to eat healthy ect but it becomes really exhausting (score: 1)

  - vclue: Yes. If you’re by yourself and your blood sugar is dropping so fast you’re worried about having a seizure or extreme low blood sugar take it while you can. Trust me it’s much better than the alternative (score: 3)
- AnotherLolAnon: Did you verify those lows with a finger stick? (score: 3)
  - AbleTime5905: Yep they were real, but I didn’t felt unusual late at night like my body adapted, I could walk ect I ate a big meal, lowered drastically insulin and still ended up in hypo (score: 2)
  - AbleTime5905: Maybe it’s not a big deal by I have naturally a super low heart rate around 55-60 so maybe that’s the reason (score: 2)
    - Wooptay: That's a normal heart rate for healthy individuals, it doesn't have anything to do with your blood glucose.


It is more likely that, as someone before me has explained already - when you used Baqsimi, your liver was given the signal to release its glucose reserves to bring up your BG.


Once those reserves are gone, they need time to refill. While they do so, you are more prone to experience additional hypos, because your body has used up its natural defense against hypos which might have otherwised helped prevent a few of these hypos you are now experiencing.


With that said, how long it takes to rebuild those reserves depends.


In healthy people with a normal carb heavy diet, it can take a few hours to a day.


With a low carb diet, it could take a few days.


If you're a diabetic on top of that, it will take even longer - even more so if during this time you are experiencing additional hypos, as your reserves are getting depleted constantly instead of having a chance to refill.


So for you right now, it is important that you eat a healthy amount of food with a healthy amount of good carbs, while potentially using a little bit less insulin than you normally would. Even if it means running a slightly higher BG for a week or so.


But if you are new and you are uncomfortable making adjustments on your own - absolutely get in touch with your endo and describe the situation. (score: 6)
- drugihparrukava: I know some people microdose glucagon, but my understanding is whenever it is administered (if person is unconscious that emergency services need to be called) and to be check out in hospital because of the after effects. Have you contacted your specialist/endocrinologist for advice? 

Our glucagon response in general is affected in type 1, we never know if and when it will work, but when we administer glucagon it forces hepatic production. Basically your liver pumping out glucose but the baqsimi multiples this effect many times. 

So get check out by a doc after using glucagon. The stores in the liver might not be replenished yet (again this is one of the processes affected by type 1 anyway so we don’t know how long until things are back to normal ish in top of using glucagon).  

Hope you’re on the mend and glad you had glucagon with you as you felt yourself passing out. (score: 1)

- Surrealistic_dream: This year I took baqsimi for the second time since it was prescribed and it was the worst experience I had. 

I ate a full meal at lunch, but I bolused wrong with only 1 additional unit of fiasp. Being affected by the summer heat my blood sugar was dropping fast in less than 1h 30. Being already full I tried not to panick and I tried correcting it with a juice box and some biscuits. After 20 minutes it was still dropping fast, I was already at 60 mg/dL still double arrows down and because it was simply too much food I threw up. Then I took a baqsimi.

I immediately regretted it because I felt a horrible cranial pressure, my nostril was burning really bad and I had heart palpitations too. I don't have any medical problems with my heart. It was only a side effect of baqsimi. The heart palpitations stopped after 10-15 minutes but the cranial pressure lasted for about 7 hours. It was so bad I couldn't even keep my head straight. Fortunately, because I didn't have any food left in my stomach after I threw up, my blood sugar came up slowly and it reached a maximum of 334 mg/dL in about 3 hours. And although it wasn't an ideal outcome, it came back in range slowly but steady.

So personally I would recommend to take nothing similar to baqsimi and instead take a glucagon injection. To have a headache is bad, but to feel dizzy and then to have these horrible side effects and being panicked at the same time is worse. Never experienced such thing with glucagon injections in my 23 years of type 1 diabetes. Unfortunately glucagon injections aren't available in my country anymore. (score: 1)
  - AbleTime5905: Yo thanks for the answer, I will stick to baqsimi for the simplicity. But yeah nose can be hurt bad, maybe your heart problem was due to a panick attack. I have the same side effect during hypo I just panick and it get worse. (score: 0)

	•	What was happening around those boluses (pre-ride meal, mid-ride correction, post-ride refuel)?
	•	Pump or MDI? If pump, did you use temp basal/override? If MDI, any basal tweaks on heavy training days?
	•	Which insulins are you on (basal + rapid), and do you change your ICR/ISF for long rides or races?
	•	Pre-ride routine: timing of pre-bolus, grams of carbs, and how much fat/protein you keep in the meal.
	•	During-ride fueling: roughly how many carbs per hour, and do you “micro-bolus” for steady drip carbs vs. bigger hits (gels/chews)?
	•	Race-day differences vs. training (adrenaline spikes, warm-up strategy, first 30–45 minutes)?
	•	CGM alert thresholds you use on the bike/run, and your go-to hypo rescue plan that doesn’t boomerang you high.
	•	Post-ride: recovery carbs/protein and whether you do a reduced correction or delayed bolus to dodge late crashes.

- Foreign_Plate_4372: I have periods of brain fog, days I would wake up and couldn't work, my blood sugar is well controlled now so it's not so  frequent. Manage your blood sugar down and things do get back to normal. 

Loads of great diet advice on here,  my advice is 

eat, starving yourself doesn't work. Diabetes.co.uk recommend less than 130grams carbs per day, aiming for slightly lower provides leeway. I use an app lose it to track nutrition, there are other apps this is not an ad. Fiber is carbs that don't convert to blood sugar. Avoid potatoes,rice, pasta, white bread. Vegetables are great - e.g. stir fry veg. Fish is great (baked fish is cheap). You may end up snacking on unhealthy stuff, but if you do work out how long it is until the next time you do, and the make the gap between the next time at least half as long again. It's amazing how you can break that habit, many of us got here through poor dietary choices and it takes time sometimes to retrain yourself.

Diagnosis can be confusing and scary but you'll get there and you'll feel amazing when you do (score: 2)

Thanks for sharing your experience. For some time I was struggling with my brain fog and was toughing it out. My last job was an absolute shit show where canteen food was terrible and getting food in and around the place was not possible. I was sustaining on instant noodles or some crap sandwich in the afternoon or sometimes just skipping meals altogether. Used to feel intense hunger pangs and confusion but was toughing it out. 

I found out that I have diabetes when I had a boil on my elbow which was not healing. Had to get it operated and found the reason the boil did not heal was  because I had diabetes. Was on medical leave for 2 weeks to get my operation wounds healed. Got fired from my job because of my brain fog and confusion symptoms and corporate thought it was best time to let go of me during my 2 weeks leave!

I am taking some time out to sort my health out. Never thought I would get it as I am not really obese, vegetarian and don't drink or smoke. Sigh! (score: 1)
- Economy_Account6128: Sleepiness especially after meals is a sign of high blood sugar. Don't blame yourself. Take prescribed medication regularly and within a week you'll see drastic improvement. Brain fog, concentration issues, frequent urination all are linked to high blood sugar. Make changes in your diet. Keep yourself hydrated.

As my own work involves a lot problem solving too, I can relate totally. I passed out during a critical online meeting and they kept calling my name! That's when I got diagnosed (score: 3)
  - nascentmind: I especially have confusion. Many things take time for me understand. I dismissed this as age issues earlier but now I think it is the diabetes. I am 42M. I checked if my reflexes are also poor by playing a fast paced video game and I think I can play decently. My eyesight though has degraded and I keep misreading things. Again not sure what is going on. (score: 1)
    - Foreign_Plate_4372: I had an issue with my eyesight and it improved after getting my blood sugar levels sorted. (score: 1)
    - LM0821: Get to an optometrist right away! You don't want your eyes to get worse, and things can change very quickly with diabetes and vision.  

It's  hard to answer your other questions without knowing your current HA1C and if you are on any medications, but yes, diabetic fatigue and brain fog are very real, especially when your diabetes isn't under control.  

Are you doing anything different than usual?  Sounds like you need a doctor's visit and some testing.  Your pancreas can start to fail, and then you run the risk of sliding from T2 to T1.  I'm not sure how common that is though! (score: 0)
      - nascentmind: Yes. I am planning to visit my Optometrist now. Having bad eyesight really is difficult for me when I have to sit for long hours in front of the computer.

My current A1C is 6.7 around 2.5 months back. I am on Metformin medication.

In the upcoming A1C I will try to do a complete blood test. (score: 1)
- kbwe1: It could be a b12 and/or folic acid issue, so certainly contact the GP and ask for those to be tested. 

If applicable it could be perimenopause or menopause.

I was also told that when I’d just changed my diet, because it was so dramatic, my body was adjusting to new lower sugar levels and that can have slightly odd side effects for a short amount of time. 
But please speak to your doctor or nurse. (score: 1)
- Wooptay: Yes, unregulated blood glucose can definitely cause brain fog and concentration issues. However if you get it under control and keep it controlled, you will return to normal. It's unlikely it has caused any long term problems unless you've been ignoring the problem for years and years, but it might still take a few weeks of regulated blood glucose to get back to your base level.

Even when your BG is generally well controlled though, blood glucose spikes can / will cause these symptoms, although they are usually short lived (as in, until you get back down to a normal range). (score: 1)
  - nascentmind: Yes I got it under control and stopped taking Vitamin B12 based on my doctor's advise.

My vision has degraded though which I thought it was due to age. When I was diagnosed I realised it is due to diabetes. I seem to misread words now which never used to happen before and in fact I used to expertly read dense engineering books and pick mistakes before. Now it is hard to read for even a short amount of time. (score: 1)
    - cocomilky: Oh interesting, why not vitamin D? I am new here… (score: 1)
- Far_Negotiation5331: Contact your doctor. (score: 0)
- CD274: Also came to mention B12/folic acid. Your diabetes meds will also make these deficiencies worse. (A bunch of meds do). Any tingling in toes or pinkies are related to this as well - it's how diabetes causes nerve damage.

(Also take magnesium, vitamin D supplements)

So yes absolutely.  And you may think you're depressed when it's been chronic blood sugar issues (score: 0)
  - nascentmind: I was taking Vitamin B12 tablets. As my A1C improved I stopped and didn't feel any effects. Now I feel cold almost everyday and yes tingling at the tips. I think I need to check with the tablets again. (score: 0)
    - CD274: So the cold thing happened to me a lot when I had blood sugar drops. People with hypoglycemia get this effect too but if you're diabetic and regularly high any big DROP can do it even if your sugar isn't hypoglycemic/is in the normal range.  Your body sees it as too big of a change. So that may be part of what's happening.

The tingling and similar definitely take B12 supplements or get all your vitamin levels checked for deficiency so you know whats happening.  Low vitamin D for diabetics is going to be more related to struggling more with insulin resistance, not nerve damage or temperature effects.  Magnesium can also be low, as well as B1, B6 and iron for us. Especially if on metformin which I assume the majority of us are on especially early on. (score: 0)

- Porqypain: Hi there. 
LADA here. Diagnosed with 31, one year ago. I kinda had 4 honey moons. Or maybe one big honey moon with 4 stronger diabetes phases. Every time I think, I am now “really” diabetic I get a several days to weeks long period during which O do not have to take basal and just a low dosage of bolus. 
My doc said: that’s LADA. Being a non-diabetic diabetic who progressively becomes more diabetic. Hehe
Best wishes to you (score: 3)
  - AbleTime5905: Damn I hope that’s not my case, it’s weird cause it has been 5 days since I took baqsimi at first I thought it was why, but now my graph is a roller coaster ( was always stable are rarely peaked over 250 before ). I am gonna send a message to my specialist if it keeps happening (score: 2)
  - AbleTime5905: Did you do anything specific to lower the effect cause that honeymoon if it one is not cool, peaking 290 in 30 min is and dump like crazy for no reason ( i lowered basal by 80%) (score: 1)
    - Porqypain: I had to find a balance regarding medicine and food intake. In order not to peak I had to cut out some carbs and combine them with fat/ proteins. Regarding the lows I had to reduce my insulin intake. That is some my life now. :D
However, I feel like the little honey moons lasted longer in beforehand, so they are now rather a few little weeks long and during this period I have to be sensitive with this rollercoaster… cgm helps a lot because I have my glucose to blood sugar sensitivity in a good observative state. (score: 1)
- Wooptay: Did you have food around 12? (score: 1)
  - AbleTime5905: Yeah but took no insulin (score: 1)
- Porqypain: May be you get your c-peptide and antibodies checked again. (score: 1)
  - AbleTime5905: I am gonna do that, hope I don’t have the same thing as you cause it’s already overwhelming if there is a part of unknown I am gonna crash out 😭😭 (score: 0)
