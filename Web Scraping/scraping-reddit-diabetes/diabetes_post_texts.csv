100 lbs down today,Eeyore_,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1owypjq/100_lbs_down_today/,"This morning the scale read 225. That's 100 lbs down from December 31, 2024, I recently passed my 46th birthday, I was 6'3"" and I weighed 325 lbs. I never imagined I could lose 100 lbs in 318 days. That's 0.314 lbs per day.   On December 31, I went to the ER with a kidney stone I had been dealing with for about a week, and it became intolerable. After getting triaged, the ER doctor asked me, ""What medication are you taking to treat your diabetes?"" I responded, ""Treat my what now?"" And he said, ""Your blood glucose is 330. You have diabetes. You need to discuss this with your primary care physician."" So, at 46 I had to establish a primary care physician.   My primary care physician (PCP) put me on metformin, and we tried to get Mounjaro. It took 5 weeks to navigate the prior authorization paperwork. I started taking Mounjaro February 7. I radically changed my diet as soon as I got home from the ER, and, over those 5 weeks, I managed to lose 7 lbs. My A1C started out at 10.2, and within 90 days it was at 6.2, and I had lost an additional 38 lbs. Putting me at 280, and the first time in nearly 30 years that I was under 300 lbs.   I did 4 weeks on 2.5 mg and 4 weeks on 5 mg, then stayed on 7.5 for 16 weeks. I've been on 10 mg since July 25. When I started on 10 mg, I weighed 258 lbs. Today, 16 weeks later, I now weigh 225.   For my diet, I started out by changing what I ate, and then, as I progressed month by month, week by week, I reduced how much I ate. Firstly, I only ate chicken breasts, romaine lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, tomatoes, cottage cheese, individually wrapped 1 oz cheeses. Initially, I ate as much of these as I wanted, but I only ate from these choices. After 5 weeks of this diet change, and starting Mounjaro, I began portion control. I began weighing what I was eating, not to control how much I ate, but to understand how much I ate. And upon starting Mounjaro, I immediately noticed my satiety was significantly improved, and my hunger was much more quickly abated.   After 4 weeks on 2.5 mg, I shifted from measuring for data collection purposes to measuring and weighing for portion control. I began making my salads with 200 grams of lettuce, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and chicken breast, 2 tbsp of salad dressing, and some olives and capers. For breakfast I would eat either 2 boiled eggs or 150 grams of cottage cheese. I maintained this rigor for my 4 weeks on 5.0 mg. My goal was to eat 1,650 calories a day.   When I started on 7.5 mg, I was about 3 months into my weight loss journey, and 2 months on Mounjaro. From the beginning of May and on, my diet was on lockdown. My new challenge was not limiting what I ate, but eating enough. on 7.5 mg, if I ate ""when I felt hungry"" I would barely eat 1,200 calories a day.   In June, I started going to a CrossFit gym. I went a little less than once a week for the whole month of May. In July, I committed to once a week and to try for twice a week. I'd do Monday and then try for Thursday or Friday, depending on my recovery. I also started being concerned about my protein intake with my significantly reduced intake. So I started buying 30 gram protein drinks. For a month, I drank 1 a day, at breakfast, mixed with equal parts coffee. This became my sole breakfast over time. I'd just make the coffee, no cottage cheese, and drink my protein coffee.   In July I tried to get into the gym twice a week for sure. I didn't quite make it to twice a week. In August I stepped up to committing to 2 times a week. You should be getting the pattern here. In September I tried for 2.5 a week, and in October I committed to going to classes 3 times a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday.   This has been my journey. I am down 100 lbs. I weigh less today than I have since I graduated high school 30 years ago. I was 16 the last time my weight was this low.   I hope to lose another 30 lbs. I want to get to 195 to see what that's like. I haven't seen what this looks like in my entire adult life. I feel better than I have in over a decade, and maybe 2 decades.

I'm on 500 MG right now and on day 3 and omg the nausea and tummy cramps. I've done some reading online about eating smaller portions and not eating carb heavy food might help but does anyone have other suggestions aswell?

A1c and doctors,shadow997ca,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1ox41ry/a1c_and_doctors/,"More of a rant than anything but also looking for opinions and what your doctors say. I get a bit frustrated dealing with 2 doctors on my Diabetes.  Diagnosed by my GP 12 years ago and put on slow and fast acting insulin about 8 months after that by the Endo who the GP referred me to. My GP calls it type 1 so I go with that. This week saw my GP and my Endo on the same day a few hours apart. I see the GP every 3 months and the Endo every 6. So every 3 months I have bloodwork done. My GP has always asked about lows and I tell her they aren't a big issue but as you all know there is going to be some. I have a cgm which alerts me at 4.2, time for me to correct before things get ugly and I manage that very well. For the past year my A1c has been between 5.6 and 5.8 which is a great improvement for me and I credit the cgm  So my GP says, it's too low, you should strive to get it around 6 or slightly higher. I say, but lower is better isn't it? She's say, ask your Endo and let me know what he says. She also suggested Ozempic and to also ask him. I did so and he says, the lower the better and maybe she is getting fasting mixed up with A1c? No she isn't but anyway he tells me I'm doing great and to keep doing it! As for Ozempic he wasn't thrilled and again says, what you're doing is working so keep it up. Tells me he would prescribe it if I want but he usually only does that for people what can't control things well or if they're over weight of which I'm not too bad. I think I'll pass on it for now.   For the ones who added Ozempic, how's it working for you? Recommended?"

My dad's recent blood test has me scared for him,teggyteggy,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1ox7uj2/my_dads_recent_blood_test_has_me_scared_for_him/,"My dad's blood report came back in and he's 56 years old.  His glucose is at 190mg/dL. His last two results back in 2023 and 2022 were 129mg/dL and 115mg/dL. His A1C is 10.4. The last two results were 7.0 and 6.8.  His BUN/Creatinine and LDL were kind of high too. 30 and 146. It have been related to being dehydrated and with the cholesterol, I'm going to do my best to help him lower his oily food intake.  I don't know what to do with the rest. I feel like he's been controlling what he eats, but clearly it isn't enough. Does anyone here see a dietician? I've always wanted him to create a strict diet plan. I know there's a plethora of information on this subreddit, but I'm also scared as much as I'm asking for help.  I've been reading some other threads and here are some things I've going to encourage/enforce my dad to do.  \- eliminate white rice and other carbs entirely and replace them with quinoa and other replacements  \- 30 minute walks after dinner. He works during other meals, so he isn't able to walk.  \- Really focus on limiting simple carbs and replacing them with fruits, veggies, meat, fibers, etc.  \- My dad snacks throughout the day. It'll be stuff like nuts like peanuts. Is this good or bad for a diabetic?     My dad's results are absolutely uncontrolled. I'd love anymore tips and advice, it's not like we have any room left to slack. I need to help my dad immediately"
How do you guys get the sensors on your terrified toddlers?,CertainButterfly4408,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1ownhlh/how_do_you_guys_get_the_sensors_on_your_terrified/,"My daughter is 4 and she is terrified of the sensors.  We’re new to them and I’m trying to find a way to get it on her that doesn’t traumatize her.  The last 2 times I had to have my husband hold her so I could get it on and she was too scared of me to even come near me for the rest of the night.  Taking it off was just as bad as putting it on.  I don’t know how to put a new one on she has full blown panic attacks if I even touch her receiver at this point, but her blood sugar also tanked today at her friends house and I didn’t know because she doesn’t have a monitor on.  I know when she’s older she will understand how important it is but right now she doesn’t get that I don’t have an option.  I fucking hate this it breaks my heart that she has to deal with this for the rest of her life."

A1C normal despite relatively unrestricted diet the past 3 months,jitterqueen,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1owquiy/a1c_normal_despite_relatively_unrestricted_diet/,"I got diagnosed with diabetes with an A1C of 12.6% in April 2024. I went low carb straight away, started walking and lowered my A1C to 5.6% within 6 months. I have been low carb, except a few days like christmas or birthdays where I had the occassional slice of cake or some potatoes/bread. Everytime I had carbs alone, I spiked hard like in the 200s. My doctor, however, has always been insistent that I need to eat carbs. Her guideline that she gave me has examples like 2 breadrolls or 3 potatoes or 1 cup of rice for lunch. Everytime I have eaten rice, I have spiked. So I have stayed low carb for over a year.  In my last appointment in August, my A1C was at 5.7, so borderline again, but I expected that since I was in bedrest for 2 months due to an ankle fracture. She was again very insistent that I eat more carbs and if carbs spike me so much then she could increase my medication. I take metformin 500 mg once a day and I really don't want more meds. I can barely remember to take that one pill everyday.  So I thought, fuck it, I'm going to eat more carbs and when the next blood test happens the results will show her why I'm low carb. I ate *almost unrestricted* for the last three months. I ate rice, not daily but definitely more than before, I had bread regularly, I ate croissants and puff pastries for breakfast twice a week or so, I ate chocolates, snacked on chips in bed, I even had cakes and ice cream. I also finished a whole pack of Spekulatius biscuits within a week a couple weeks ago (these are full of sugar and just eating 5 spiked me to 240). I knew I was damaging my body but I wanted to prove a point really.  My blood test was on Tuesday and I just got my results. My A1C is at 5.5% and my Cholesterol has improved. I am reeling with confusion. What the fuck happened?"
Should I get a second opinion?,QuirkyPassenger5894,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1ox3is2/should_i_get_a_second_opinion/,"As the title states I am wondering if I should get a second opinion...  A little backstory; I have PCOS and have been pre-diabetic for the last 10 years- if not more. A1c has hovered around 5.5-5.8 on and off. Took metformin, tried changing diet on my own and always struggled.  June of this year my A1c crawled up to 6.5 and consistently stayed there. My doc diagnosed me with T2 diabetes. It runs in the family and even though i knew that it still was a shock.  I was put on Munjaro and have been very successful. Bs is anywhere from 100-150...only ever seen it creep towards 200+ when I ate deli fried chicken or McDonald's..which id say is a normal reaction.   Just wondering if I should get a second opinion? Do I really have t2 or still prediabetic? Do doctors every undiagnose ppl with things?  Or am i just really lucky to have good results on munjaro? I fear if i ever get off it I might not be as successful managing my bs."
I need advice on transitioning out of being on a keto diet.,AccomplishedDuck4329,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1ox26g2/i_need_advice_on_transitioning_out_of_being_on_a/,"After years of awful doctors I went through, who wouldn't listen to my struggle with diabetes. I finally got an endo who diagnosed me with Type 1.5, over type 1. In my early 20s I struggled so hard on keeping my blood sugar leveled, until I was 23 and had my sugars go over 400 night after night, until about new years before I turned 24, where I switched full time to a keto diet.  Ive been on a keto diet for almost 5 years now, but my last appointment with my new endo prescribed me metformin again (I was taken off it entirely bc I was told it wouldnt work when I was 20, even tho I kept telling my previous endo I had insulin resistance issues and he wouldn't help me with type 2 meds in the slightest).  Anywho, within the past couple years, it's become increasingly difficult to sustain being on keto anymore. I haven't taken my metformin that I was prescribed in september, mostly because   1. too scared to try it yet  2. I wanna build up a supply of metformin before I start  3. In the past couple months I was able to consistently keep my sugars below 200 majority of the time.  I wanna transition out of keto so bad. I have to eat a lot of food, especially meat, because Ill get severe hunger pangs if I don't. To the point that I believe it's affecting my blood pressure negatively. I have to eat a lot of salt, so I don't get those low blood pressure symptoms. And I think now I'm starting to have my blood pressure go from high to low, a lot.  Here's some points about my current medical situation  1. Im on an insulin pump (endo wants to try out me with my insulin pump on with 0.9 hourly basal)  2. I was prescribed 500mg slow-release metformin pills that Im supposed to take once a day.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Even if I have to take it really slow."
T2 - Remission &amp; Going off meds decision question,Ladder-Necessary,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1oww7rh/t2_remission_going_off_meds_decision_question/,"This question is for those of you in remission or who could be candidates to try going off meds but choose not to.   First, definition of remission from ADA, so we're on the same page: ""This group proposed “remission” as the most appropriate descriptive term, and HbA1c &lt;6.5% (48 mmol/mol) measured at least 3 months after cessation of glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy as the usual diagnostic criterion.  For those of you in remission or close, what A1c are you comfortable with? What informed your decision? Or, if you have tight control and continue meds, what guides that decision.   If I (33F) stop meds, I could probablyyy get a under 6.5% A1C...(5.3% for last six months since diagnosis at 10.4%, and currently trending lower-with farxiga).   But I'm not convinced I'd be in the normal range (&lt;5.7%) with meds. I also know farxiga can have other protective benefits, but also that any meds come with risks.   So, how did yall decide to try life sans meds, or why do yall continue meds? What A1c feels comfortable or risky for you?"

Eversense 365 CGM procedure,Wcked_Production,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1owoj3o/eversense_365_cgm_procedure/,"I had the Eversense 365 CGM procedure done 16 days ago and the device has been incredible. I went through their PASS program since it wasn’t covered by my insurance which ended being $2400 but if it’s covered by your insurance then it should be $350 plus $200 for the insertion so $550. Cheaper than a year’s worth of CGM supplies. The surgery literally was about 30 seconds and painless. The first 24 hours you don’t calibrate the sensor but the next day you calibrate it 4 times every 2 hours in total 8 hours with a glucose meter which I used the Contour NeXT. After that you calibrate it once a day for 2 weeks preferably within 1-2 hours of the chosen time. Then it becomes once a week for the remainder of the year. The phone app will notify you when to calibrate it. The accuracy is great in my opinion since calibrating it, I’ve been getting glucose meter readings such as 125 and 124 on the sensor. The transmitter will vibrate on your body when you go low and doesn’t have the loud alarm on the Dexcom. You can also go for a run without bringing your phone and it’ll vibrate when you go low which means a lot to me because I don’t bring my phone when I run. Recommend anyone with the means to get it if you want better hypoglycemia detection, comfort, sensitive skin, less waste, and possibly cheaper than CGM supplies.  TLDR: Recommend the Eversense 365 implant because it’ll last a year, less pain because no filament poking, less waste, cheaper, body vibrations instead of alarm. Any questions feel free to ask."

My GP wants me to see my endo about switching to insulin. I’ve lost 125lbs in an effort to improve a1c when we thought I was still type 2. I am really worried about gaining weight with insulin. I know someone who is 1.5 and taking insulin and Ozempic. Is there anyone who is 1.5 and takes ozempic or oral meds along with insulin? Also is the an insulin that causes at least less weight gain?

High a1c,Conscious_Yam_5204,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1owc1in/high_a1c/,"Hello everyone! I (F 28) have been dealing with a problem and would appreciate any kind of advice. Last year my a1c was 5.1 and fasting blood sugar 78. Never even thought about diabetes. Then i developed severe panic disorder and a bad habit of binging juice, sugar, honey, milk or any high carb food you can think of every hour or two day and night as i couldn’t sleep. This happened because a doctor told me my blood sugar is kinda low all day and my panicked self spiraled. I couldn’t sleep and also developed  agoraphobia.  In October this year i decided to test my a1c again even though my doctor said i just need to calm down. The result was 7.33 and I completely lost it. I bought a glucose monitor as advised by my doctor and cut all added sugar and white bread. Since changing my diet, my blood sugar has been maximum 144 1,5 hours after a heavier meal and 116 at 2 hours. Normal meal like chicken and salad and quinoa the peak is 120-130 then it comes down. My doctor said since my a1c reached this level I am a permanent diabetic. My new doctor daud it was situational due to high sugar intake hourly and i should recover if i eat normally. I really do not know what to believe and am at my darkest point. Please if anyone has any advice/opinion, I would deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance for reading all this and I wish good health to anyone struggling."

Having a moment of true grief, mourning what could have been, things I could have done to keep this from happening, etc, while also feeling shame and disappointment in myself and guilt for my amazing wife and how supportive of me she always is. DISCLAIMER: I’m in touch with reality enough to understand I’m being super dramatic and that this is not a death sentence at all.   I could just use some compassion, some guidance on where to start, any helpful tips, stories….books maybe?? Truly anything that I can begin with. I do have a relative plan to change diet and exercise but can always use a refresher and advice. I’m an open book.  This just feels so daunting and like my life will never be the same. My friendships and relationship all love and move around food a lot, as a lot of others do, so that certainly doesn’t help. Kind of lost, searching in the dark and looking at this community for some hopium and copium lol."
T2D just started Wegovy (0.25mg) and happy so far!,VolCata,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1ow0wsl/t2d_just_started_wegovy_025mg_and_happy_so_far/,"It's been little under two weeks on Wegovy and I'm pleased to see a 4kg drop so far. Like yeah I imagine some of that will be water weight but it is nice to see anyway.   Having gone on this medication, mostly to help with my blood sugar - I've seen my blood glucose drop from hovering around 11.5-14 mmol/L to between 7-9 mmol/L. Of course there's A LOT of room for improvement but hey. We are slowly getting there and will do as I lose more weight.   Before Wegovy, I tried toying around with a very low calorie diet (VLCD) involving shakes and soups which wasn't all that helpful or successful tbh.   Constipation and on/off fatigue aside, I've found the two weeks on this medication so much better. I do actually feel like I've more energy at times and much less run down than I did before. I'm also enjoying the gradual shift in all of those numbers!"
Treatment-induced neuropathy (TIND),Emotional-Pen3085,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1ovrxe5/treatmentinduced_neuropathy_tind/,"I'll keep this as short as possible. I am 35 and was diagnosed with T1 in my mid-20s. I maintained pretty good control for many years, with my A1C bouncing between 5 and 6. I went off the rails a couple of years ago after developing severe anxiety over hypos (specifically one that occurred just after a basal injection, which mortified me) and as a result, began letting my BG run far too high. I finally started seeing a therapist a few months ago to deal with this and have gotten less afraid of taking my insulin and been more aggressive. Two months ago my A1C was nearly 15 (yeah, *I know*) but I have since brought it down to 10 and am continuing to make progress.  In the last week,, I have begun experiencing pretty noticeable numbness in my feet (specifically around my big toe, especially on my left foot) and tingling/pins-and-needles/burning sensations. When my BG was at its worst, I had occasional foot irritation but not this level of sensations, specifically the numbness. It really alarmed me because it seemed to come out of nowhere and I know that my A1C is going in the right direction.  I did some reading and it appears that some people experience something known as ""treatment-induced diabetic neuropathy"" which comes on when A1C levels are lowered more than 2-3% in a relatively short timespan. I suspect this is what I am experiencing as it seems to make sense with the timing of things. What scares me is that in many people's accounts of this phenomenon, they describe it as becoming unbearably painful and I fear that as my BG improves, the pain/numbness is going to get much worse. I read that the suggestion for avoiding TIND is to lower the A1C gradually (i.e. around 2% every three months or so), but at that rate it would take me far longer than I'd like to bring things back to some semblance of normalcy.  I am seeing a diabetes educator this week to help further get myself on track and am wondering if they may be a good resource to talk about this. I see my endocrinologist again in a little less than two months. Based on the timing and progress, I cannot help but think that TIND is what I am experiencing. Strangely, I'd never heard of it before, nor has my endocrinologist ever mentioned it. I am curious if anyone else here has experienced this and has any insight or stories. As I said, it seemed to come on out of nowhere and it frankly really freaked me out."
Is it garmin or LinX CGM app problem?,ko_notiek,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1ovw725/is_it_garmin_or_linx_cgm_app_problem/,"Hi.

Phone shows gray number with mmol/L , but watch is showing just LinX notification as seen in images but is empty.  I'm thinking this is LinX app issue that is sending some weird color code to garmin, or it can be something else that garmin doesn't have access to?

Even something as light as walking the dog or raking leaves will cause a single down-arrow within 20 minutes. This doesn't seem to happen the same way when I put it in manual mode, there is still a drop from the exercise but it doesn't seem anywhere near as steep and it also doesn't seem to carry the same momentum. If I don't catch an Automated Mode low before the graph turns red, I'll be out of commission for an hour or more, but the Manual Mode exercise lows seem much easier to fix.   Also yes, I have tried Activity Mode and honestly I can't see an improvement.  Also, a more general exercise-related question: is it normal to have your BG drop so fast during intense cardio that you literally cannot consume glucose fast enough to offset it? I've had experiences while running where I start absolutely chugging grape juice or gatorade when my BG is 150 and there is absolutely nothing that can keep it out of the red other than stopping running."

The pump was fine but the sensor was so bad it was not usable. 5 years ago I switched to omnipod dash and dexcom g6 and it was great. Now my doctor wants me to switch to 780g. I'm excited about the new pump but that means I would need to use the guardian again. Last time I had guardian sensor it lost connection all the time and often gave inaccurate readings. It is also really difficult to put on by yourself. I have grown from a teenager to a young adult in the time I have used dexcom so I'm hoping the guardian will work better for me now. I would really appreciate your experiences and possible tips living with the guardian sensor. I'm also a swimmer so would like to hear about swimming with the guardian.
